<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 22 -->

<p>Wearing only the intricately designed ceremonial robes given them by
their attendants, Buffy and Willow followed the priests down the back
stairway to the covered parking area where two identical unmarked panel
vans were waiting for them, complete with drivers. The doors were opened
revealing an enclosed area with four comfortable looking 'captains'
chairs. </p>

<p>"From here we go our separate ways." the first priest told them.
"Slayer, if you will accompany my brother and join him in that vehicle,
he will see that all your questions are answered to your satisfaction.
You will be taken to a sacred place to complete your preparations for
tonight's ceremony." </p>

<p>With a nervous glance at the enclosed van, Buffy turned an imploring
look to her lover. Willow gave her a reassuring smile and, with a show
of total confidence, the witch climbed into the van assigned to her. </p>

<p>The first priest and two of the women followed the red head into the van
closing the doors behind them. Seeing that her partner put her trust in
these people, Buffy followed her example and quickly climbed into the
van and with some difficulty eventually made herself comfortable in the
reclining seat provided for the trip. </p>

<p>Once everyone was in their respective places and getting a signal from
their passengers, the drivers started the vans and with profession skill
eased them into traffic, pointing them east toward the heavily wooded
hills that over looked Sunnydale. </p>

<p>Unable to see the outside, Willow relaxed into her seat and reached out
to her partner with her mind. Feeling her lover's confusion and near
panic at being separated from the other half of her soul, Willow sent
the Slayer reassuring and comforting thoughts hoping to calm her lover
and allay her fears for Willow's well being. </p>

<p>Finally sensing the Slayer's uneasy acceptance of her companion's
thoughts, the young witch could feel her lover reluctantly surrendering
to the circumstance, temporarily at least. </p>

<p>That accomplished, the red head allowed herself to relax into the
oversized reclining seat for the remainder of the ride. </p>

<p>After a little over an hours ride into the hilly wilderness overlooking
Sunnydale, the van turned down a side road that, judging by the sounds
coming from the tires, was gravel instead of the asphalt they'd been on. </p>

<p>Shortly the van slowed to a smooth stop, and without any undue ceremony
the doors of the van opened flooding the compartment with sunlight,
fresh air and the sounds of a beautiful summers day.
Willow followed the others out of the van. She looked around and was
pleasantly surprised. </p>

<p>"This is very nice." Willow commented, enchanted by her surroundings. "I
only hope it's not as rustic as it appears." </p>

<p>"Don't worry Sorceress." the young brunette attendant named Kati said
softly, not wanting to disturb the peace of the moment. "It may be
isolated here, but the areas have all the modern convinces, including
telephones." </p>

<p>"Thank the Goddess." Willow sighed wistfully, then looked around for the
other van. "Where's Buffy?" </p>

<p>"Your Slayer is at an almost identical facility about a half mile from
here." the priest reassured her. "She is going through the same
preparations as you." </p>

<p>"Okay. but I wish your friends luck if Buffy doesn't want to be
prepared." Willow chuckled softly, and not without sympathy.
"That's true, Sorceress." the second blonde haired attendant named
Timmra quipped knowingly. "However I believe both of you will find the
process of preparation quite enjoyable." </p>

<p>The two women giggled and Willow noticed a conspiratorial glance between
the two women that made her wonder just what she was in for over the
next several hours. </p>

<p>The priest gave a blessing over the grounds and the three women and with
a bow excused himself, promising to return later in time to escort them
to the circle for the ceremony. </p>

<p>Once he was gone the two women led a leery red headed witch to a small
dome topped building. They opened the entrance and Willow could smell
the pleasant aroma of cedar mixed with herbs and spices. </p>

<p>They led her into the small cedar lined room and helped their charge out
of her robe leaving her naked and bade her sit on a long towel covered
bench build into the back wall of the room. </p>

<p>As they left Kati flipped a switch and turned a dial that started the
system that produced steam by intermittently spraying water on heated
rocks. Then they left her there alone to relax, and meditate while they
attended to other details. </p>

<p>Willow sat back and let out a sigh of contentment, telling herself to
remember to thank the Goddess for whoever it was that thought of this
part of the preparations, they were true geniuses. </p>

<p>She was feeling almost too good especially after a day like yesterday. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;And a night like last night.&lt;&gt; she thought to herself, a grin of pure
animal pleasure on her face. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before Willow's mind was feeling waves of pleasure from
some where other than her own body. </p>

<p>A slow sexy smile came over her face as her lover's feelings joined her
own. Their two kindred spirits communed on an etherial plain far more
harmonious than their own, as time became a thing of no consequence. All
that mattered was the feeling of true peace and contentment that washed
over them. </p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity squeezed into a minute, Willow felt
herself being drawn back to the confines of her corporeal self. She
frowned as she recognised the disturbance as someone calling her name. </p>

<p>Willow looked up to put a face to the soft yet insistent voice that
interrupted her visions and frowned slightly as the blonde's name evaded
her memory momentarily. </p>

<p>"Pardon me for disturbing you, friend Willow." the older woman
apologised misinterpreting the frown. "But the time has come for you to
move forward with your preparations." </p>

<p>"Oh...I..uh...I mean sure, Timmra." the witch almost shouted, as the
attendant's popped into her mind. "Don't apologise. I was just thinking
is all and I didn't hear you until just now." </p>

<p>"That's alright, dear." Timmra assured her. "This is a big day for you
and your Slayer and you're allowed to suffer from a little nervous
tension. I mean I'm nervous, and I'm only here to assist." </p>

<p>Both women laughed the tension broken. Timmra handed the red-head a
large fluffy towel to wrap around herself and led her to a shower in the
main cabin, so the sweaty young woman could rinse off. </p>

<p>Once Willow was rinsed off, she was instructed to wrap the towel around
herself again and follow Timmra to another room, where Kati was waiting
for them standing next to a long narrow padded leather table.
The two attendants helped the now curious red head up onto the table
and, after removing the towel, had Willow lay on her stomach. </p>

<p>As shy as she had always been, Willow was more than a little unsure
about being disrobed in front of these two fairly unknown women. </p>

<p>Fortunately they had been chosen for this duty for their ability to be
reassuring to others no matter the situation no matter how little they
knew them. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before the red-head was laughing and chatting happily
with her new found friends as if she'd known them all her life and
wasn't totally naked while they were wearing hardly anything themselves. </p>

<p>Once Willow was relaxed, Kati retrieved two bottles of scented massage
oil that had been warming in a pan of hot water. </p>

<p>She and Timmra poured a liberal amount of the fragrant oil in their
hands and began gently rubbing it into the soft skin of their charges
neck and back. </p>

<p>Taking their time the two women used their talented strong hands to work
out every kink and knot in every muscle in Willow's body, from her neck
all the way down to the soles of her feet. </p>

<p>When they finished massaging her feet the red head was so relaxed she
couldn't move. At least she didn't think so until Kati helped her roll
over and the two women began to repeat the process on the front side of
the now very red witch. </p>

<p>The normally demure young woman would have nearly fainted from
embarrassment, but her life with Buffy and the bond they shared had done
wonders for her self esteem and confidence, but even her new-found
strength met it's match when the two talented (and quite attractive, she
was forced to admit to herself) women began working their wonders on the
muscles of the front side of her fully exposed front. </p>

<p>The erotic possibilities of their particular talent was not lost on
their charge and she feared that any reaction she might have to their
admittedly enjoyable ministrations would be misconstrued and create an
undesired complication for all concerned. </p>

<p>Despite her fears the two women ceased their attentions long before
their charge felt anything but relaxed. They left Willow to rest while
the next phase of the process was being prepared. </p>

<p>Once again Willow's thoughts floated to that etherial plane where she
enjoyed complete freedom of spirit. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;This has got to be what Heaven is like.&lt;&gt; Willow thought to herself
.&lt;&gt;I
hope Buffy is feeling this good.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>A smile crossed her lips as she reached and felt her lovers own feelings
of pure pleasure. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I'll have to remember to get some pointers from Kati and Timmra before
we leave.&lt;&gt; the smiling red-head decided. &lt;&gt;I bet even the Chosen One
couldn't resist this, especially with a couple of extra moves added.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>After allowing the young bride to enjoy this rare opportunity to
completely relax for a while, Kati returned for her and led the still
groggy witch to another room that contained a huge sunken tub filled
with hot scented water. </p>

<p>The two women helped Willow into the tub, then gently bathed her. The
red head was nearly unaware of what her two companion were doing until
they were nearly finished. She was amazed a how secure and safe these
two, up till now, strangers had made her feel. </p>

<p>They left her up to her chin in the tub, her back resting against the
side of the fiberglass nirvana, her head laid back over the edge, her
eyes closed in total serenity.
Willow was completely oblivious to the concept of time and was totally
unaware of the hour when her attendants returned for her. </p>

<p>"The hour of your joining draws near, friend Willow." Timmra said, her
clear soft voice gently interrupting the young woman's thoughts. "It is
time to finish your preparations." </p>

<p>"Ah okay if you say so." the redhead agreed. "But you have no idea how
hard this is to leave." </p>

<p>With a quiet chuckle the older woman helped Willow from the tub and with
Kati's assistance, used large soft towels to dry the slight red-head's
body. </p>

<p>They led her to another room where they helped her, brushing out the
scarlet shoulder length locks until they shone with a luster all it's
own, the light reflecting flaming highlights causing the halo effect
that so enraptured her lover. </p>

<p>Finally they helped Willow into her gown and stepped back to admire the
results of their daylong efforts. Both women gasped at the regal beauty
of this naive yet powerful woman. </p>

<p>They had realized that she was pretty when they had begun, but now
the sight of her dazzled and humbled them. </p>

<p>Now they saw what Buffy saw every time she looked at her beloved Willow. </p>

<p>"She truly is the great Sorceress." Kati, the younger of the two,
whispered in awe of the sight. </p>

<p>"Yes she is my dear." her elder companion said reverently. "The true
mate of the Slayer." </p>

<p>Suddenly aware of their own need to get ready the two women excused
themselves. </p>

<p>"If you will wait in the entry room we will join you shortly." Timmra
told her. "I believe you will find a gift awaiting there for you." </p>

<p>With a sly knowing smile the older woman followed her friend out of the
room. </p>

<p>As Willow entered the front room of the cabin her nose was the first to
notice that something in the room had changed since she'd entered it
hours earlier. </p>

<p>The fragrance of flowers assaulted her sense of smell following her nose
the witch saw a huge bouquet of flowers.
She smiled when she saw it consisted of white roses (Buffy's favorite)
and her own favorite lilies. </p>

<p>Examining the floral display closely Willow found a note written in her
lovers well known hand. </p>

<p><i>For my Wills<br>
With everything I am.<br>
 B. </i></p>

<p>Unfolding the paper the bleary eye red head found an ancient poem that
Buffy had liked from the minute Willow showed to her. </p>

<p><i>Join with me under a garland of stars,<br>
Conifers silent witness<br>
To night winds echoed vows<br>
Throughout universal whiteness<br>
The sepulchre of the Gods<br>
Touch me once for all time<br>
All lives that are to be<br>
Our love enshrined<br>
Join with me under the gaze of the stars, <br>
Celestial concourse, Bless our joy<br>
Now and forever more<br>
Join me, my sister, my soul, my love </i></p>

<p>Willow could feel the hot tears fall from eyes to leave trails down her
cheeks, and when her two companions joined her and inquired as to the
reason for her tears she showed them the note. They too were soon in
tears. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Thank the Goddess for waterproof make-up.&lt;&gt; Willow thought with a
slight smile. &lt;&gt;I got a feeling it will get a work out before this night
is through.&lt;&gt; </p>
