<!-- Second Chance \ Part 3 -->

<p>In just a few hours I'll be out of this hellhole. I haven't
seen Angel in a long time and I'm starting to wonder what will happen
when I get out. He was supposed to come by to talk to me about living
arrangements, but ever since that dream I had with B I'm not sure
what the hell is going on. I haven't seen her either, so I'm starting
to think that maybe that wasn't really a slayer dream. I should have
known better in the first place. After all, why would she want me to
go back with her? </p>

<p>Of course, it may have been a slayer dream. She knows I love
her now and she could be using that to get back at me. Give me the
false hope of a second chance and then snatch it away from me just
like I tried to take the things that meant the most to her away. But
is B really the type to do that sort of thing? I know she has every
right to hate me after what I did to her, but she'd be sinking to my
level to do something like that and she's nothing like me. </p>

<p>No, she's everything I'm not. Everything I wish I could be
and the only thing I've ever really wanted in life. She's the reason
I can't give up, no matter what. Even if the dream wasn't real, if
she does still hate me I'll spend the rest of my life fighting for
her. I have to have some reason to live after all, and saving the
world that fucked me is hardly it. </p>

<p>The last few days have been pure hell on me. I thought I'd be
glad to get out of here, but in truth I'm scared as hell. It's so
much easier sitting here and being sorry, than actually having to
face the people who's lives I tried to hurt. The only thing that's
keeping me even half together is that in my dream B said she loved
me. Maybe it was a lie, and I suppose I'll soon find out if it was or
not but it sure was nice. I wish I could sleep, or maybe even write
but there's nothing for me to do other than stare at the wall for the
next few hours and hope beyond all hope that B's around still when I
get out. </p>

<p>The sound of keys clanging breaks me from my trance and I
finally manage to break my gaze from the wall that I've been staring
at. The guard stops at my cell and starts unlocking it, a look of
disgust on her face that I can't help but smile at. I give her a
cocky smile and a look that lets her know I hate her just as much as
she hates me. </p>

<p>I expect her to cuff me like she always does but as soon as
my cell is unlocked she starts walking away so I grab the few things
I have and follow her. All the other inmates are looking at me too,
and as I walk out I can feel the heat of their stares on my back. I
pause and then turn around to blow them a kiss and give them the same
look of hate that I gave the guard just a few moments ago. A few of
them shout obscenities at me and I just walk off, finally on my way
to freedom, and more importantly, on my way to B.</p>

<p>I'm stopped to fill out some paper work, and it seems like I
can't sign my name fast enough. I just want to get the hell out of
here. Even though it only takes a few minutes to fill the papers out
it seems like a lifetime. "I don't want to see you back in here
again," the man behind the desk tell me. Maybe he thinks his words
are what's going to keep my in line when I get out. I just give him a
half smile and turn around and stare at the door. This is it. </p>

<p>Here and now, my second chance begins. This is my chance to
live life like I should have in the first place. I feel the smile
spread across my lips as I step outside. Soon I make my way out of
the gates to the parking lot and look around as if I've never been
outdoors before, taking everything around me in. Then finally it all
sinks in. Where do I go from here? </p>

<p>I start walking towards the street with no destination in
mind just yet but then a voice stops me dead in my tracks. "Trying to
run away from me already?" I can't help but laugh, and it seems that
it's the only thing I can do since my body seems to be glued in
place. I guess she wasn't lying in the dream.</p>

<p>"B, you know your nuts right?" I say as I turn around to face
her. It's a good thing I spoke before I looked at her, because I'm
sure that I wouldn't have been able to speak after looking at her.
Just when you think a person can't be any more beautiful than they
already are, they gotta go and prove you wrong.</p>

<p>"I know you probably want some exorcise after being stuck in
that small cell, but I'd rather have you drive back to Sunnydale with
me than have you walk." She gives me that little laugh and smile of
hers and before I know what I'm doing I have her pulled into my arms.</p>

<p>"That dream was real wasn't it?" I ask as I bury my face in
her hair trying to hide the tears that are threatening to spill from
my eyes. "Can you really give me another chance B? I'm so sorry for
all I did but if you can't forgive me I understand."</p>

<p>"I forgive you Faith. When I came here to see you, I had no
intentions of ever saying this, but I forgive you. I won't forget any
of it, but I can forgive." She pulled herself out of my arms and look
at me.  She brought her hand up to wipe away the few stray tears that
slipped from my eyes and smiles softly at me, assuring me that what
she says is true. "You have to promise me one thing though."</p>

<p>"Anything B." Hesitantly I take her hand in my own, and watch
her eyes to gauge her reaction. She gives my hand a soft squeeze as
our fingers entwine to let me know it's okay.</p>

<p>"Promise me you'll never leave me alone again."</p>

<p>I look a little confused for a moment at that. It's not like
B's ever been alone with the scoobs and her family around. But then I
remember the dream, and her saying she loved me too and the
realization sets in. "I promise B. I'll always be with you." She's
searching my eyes and I smile at her to let her know I won't hide
anything though there's something I'm dying to say and I assume she
can tell.</p>

<p>"You can say it you know." Yup, she knows.</p>

<p>I nod slowly and look her in the eyes. I reach my hand up and
brush a few strands of her hair behind her ear and let my palm gently
rest on her cheek. "I love you B." Before I have a chance to be
afraid of what I just said I feel her arms around my neck, slowly
pulling me towards her. Just as my eyes close I feel her lips softly
brush against mine and I start to wonder if this is another dream of
mine. The kiss slowly deepens and I realize something. </p>

<p>I've never felt like I belong anywhere before. I've never
been loved, or needed but now I finally realize that I belong with
her. Our bond as slayers brought us together. A bond that no one will
ever be able to touch, and somehow through all the hurt we've come to
love each other.</p>

<p>She wraps her arms around my waist and ends the kiss much too
soon. "I love you Faith." I feel her lips press softly against my
neck and she takes hold of my hand and starts leading me towards her
car. "Lets go home," she says softly. I still don't know where I'm
going to stay, or what will happen once I get back in good 'ol
Sunnydale but one things for sure. B is my home; my safe place and
where she goes, I'll gladly follow.</p>
