<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 11 -->

<P>"So is the crew still speaking to me?" The voice of Tom Paris was a bit breathless from his position lying on his back staring at the ceiling. He would have chosen another position, but Voyager's EMH had erected a force field to keep him immobile after his verbal warnings were not enough. "Well I am." Paris rolled his eyes. "You're speaking to a patient." The EMH sighed. "I couldn't tell you, though I'll admit I haven't had to turn away any visitors." A sigh was his first response as his patient began to speak. "I wasn't going to mess up our way home. I just wanted to make it look like Seven had been too efficient yet again and gotten me hurt."</P>
<P>The EMH continued for him. "Then you save the engine from being destroyed by Seven's rampant efficiency while getting a few burns for dramatic effect. B'Elanna comes to her senses, leaves Seven and tends your injuries before fixing the engine and delivering us all home. Is that the gist of it?" The Doctor's normally sarcastic tone had become scornful. "See? Even you hate me now and you've never seen Earth." The Doctor walked up and placed his hands on the side of the biobed. "I'm angry because you nearly killed yourself AND Commander Chakotay over a bad break up. I'm angry because you continue to disregard feelings other than your own, and I'm angry because even now you worry about yourself."</P>
<P>Tom Paris looked like he was trying to shake his head, but could not because of the retraining field. "That's not it at all. B'Elanna would have me back, Seven would understand about being human and making mistakes, and if Harry was any smart he would be able to move in and finally get the girl." The Doctor shook his head. "I would like to think Mr. Kim would have more sense then that. You set up that little wager over Seven of Nine and its fall out was disastrous. I'd hate to think what could have happened this time." "You don't get it. Nothing bad was supposed to happen! Everyone was going to end up happy." The EMH stuck his head over the head of Tom Paris. "One problem, you got caught."</P>

<P>"Now, how do I punish someone for trying to sabotage our ride home?" Janeway looked across her desk into the face of her first officer, but he seemed unwilling to look at her. "I have to decline to comment on that." Janeway expelled a sigh. "I'm just asking for your thoughts, both as first officer, and as someone who was almost killed." "As first officer I have to note that the near destruction of the experimental craft only happened because I interfered. The same goes for his assault on a superior officer." Janeway shook her head. "He attempted to damage ships function and you simply did your duty by trying to stop him. The fact is that he did more than attempt to interfere with an experiment. This experiment is going to be our way home. As far as I am concerned that is as bad as tampering with the warp core or life support."</P>
<P>Chakotay nodded slowly. "As someone who was almost killed, and as someone who wants to get home I have to say this has been unacceptable. Even when he violated the Prime Directive and risked the crew he was doing it for moral reasons and the crew was just guilty by association. This time his actions were solely for his own purposes and endangered the crew directly. We have said it time and time again. "We're all we've got out here." "Thank you Chakotay both as my first officer, and as my friend." He looked at her expectantly and her eyes fell shut as she massaged the bridge of her nose.</P>
<P>"Mr. Paris has proven that he can be a capable crewmember, but his behavior as an officer has crossed the line. So effective immediately Mr. Paris is no longer a Starfleet officer. He will be listed as an enlisted crewmember AFTER the completion of Starfleet basic training under Tuvok. Until such time he will not be allowed to serve in any function on this ship and will be considered a civilian passenger. His holodeck and replicator privileges are revoked and will only be reinstated upon the completion of his studies. Any privileges remaining are awarded to Mr. Neelix to distribute among the crew as he sees fit." Chakotay nodded. "I don't think I should be the one to inform him. So I can inform Mr. Tuvok or the Doctor."</P>
<P>Janeway held up her hand. "I pronounced the sentence and I will deliver it. It's been my leniency that's allowed it to get this far." Chakotay seemed ready to argue, but the hand Janeway held up stopped its path back down to her desk and motioned him to silence again. "Chakotay, we want Paris to take responsibility for his actions, and I need to take responsibility for mine. I wanted to mentor Mr. Paris like his father mentored me, but instead I coddled him like his father's name had been doing all his life. I still believe in Mr. Paris, but I realize that he won't take advantage of another chance unless he is forced to earn it. Now whether he succeeds or fails is up to him."</P>

<P>"You're giving Tom's holodeck time to US?" The disbelief was as much in B'Elanna's gaze as it was in her voice as she turned to look at Seven of Nine. The two women stared at each other and then turned in unison to look into the smiling face of Neelix. "It seemed only fair. It was his attempts to damage your engine that caused him to loose them." The two looked at each other again, the brows high on both their foreheads. Seven was the one to speak when they looked back once more. "Neither of us use the holodeck enough to compare to MISTER Paris." The accent on the lack of rank caused both to look, which got them a grin in response.</P>
<P>B'Elanna quietly said. "You have a mean streak." Seven simply continued to grin as B'Elanna continued to speak. "What we could use are Tom's replicator rations." Neelix looked down at his feet. "I was planning on using them for the party to celebrate Chakotay's successful use of the engine." Seven looked to B'Elanna and spoke. "Would they be able to use the holodeck time for the celebration?" B'Elanna smiled and nodded. "Yeah, that's it! Neelix use the holodeck time to program a party hall, musicians that sort of thing." Neelix smiled. "If you have any suggestions just let me know, but I will guarantee you will have a great time no matter what!"</P>
<P>As Neelix turned and left the pair to their meal Torres gently swatted Seven in the bicep. "Somebody is feeling vindictive." Seven shook her head. "It is one thing for Mr. Paris to have the feelings he did, but to endanger the many because of them is unacceptable." B'Elanna smirked. "Yes, but to control ones feelings because she is afraid of one person's response is just as unacceptable." Seven blushed and looked down at her plate. "Anger I could manage, rejection I could not." B'Elanna reached across the table and caressed Seven's cheek. "So much time wasted, so much to make up for." Seven's eyes shot back up as she shook her head. "It is my inability to express my emotions that caused the problem."</P>
<P>B'Elanna gently shook her head no. "If I had shown you an ounce of kindness you might have been more willing to express yourself. Though you have been getting better at expressing those emotions." Seven smiled shyly. "My latest teacher has been quite an efficient instructor." B'Elanna smiled and seemed ready to speak when Seven interrupted. "She has been a far better kisser then the Doctor." B'Elanna paused, then grinned at Seven and softly swatted her arm again. "See? Mean streak."</P>
