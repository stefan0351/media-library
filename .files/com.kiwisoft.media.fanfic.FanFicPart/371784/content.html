<P><B>dial-up sucks. just throwing that out there. and it sucks even more when you have a slow-ass ancient laptop from the dinosaur ages. that's how much i love you guys. i boot up my tyranasaurus-machine and wait for the whole dial-up connection and even wait for the slow internet, just so i can post a new chapter for y'all. feel special. feel very special.</B></P><P>"Miley, where have you been! Taking off like that? Not okay. Especially when you know you're in danger of not graduating! If you ever pull something like this again I'll-"</P><P>"You'll what, Lilly? You're not my mom." I didn't mean to spit that out. At all. I guess I'm just so used to being a bitch it comes second nature now. I came back from skipping school, one of my favorite activities, to come talk to Lilly about us, if there even is an "us," and this is what I do? I snap at her for being concerned? I'm such a douche bag.</P><P>Hurt flooded her features as she set down her fork and leaned back in her chair at our lunch table. "Miley, I-"</P><P>"Ugh, Lilly, no, I'm sorry. I came back here to sort things out with you and then I say something like that. I didn't mean it, honest. Look, we need to talk. Yesterday did us no good in the way of sorting things out and we really just need to discuss everything and-"</P><P>I was interrupted my the annoyance that is Oliver buzzing over to our table, sitting next to me. "Whatup, my new favorite couple?"</P><P>"We're not a couple," Lilly corrected, looking down at her plate. I reached my hand across the table in an attempt to grasp hers but she pulled it away.</P><P>Oliver, of course, saw this little exchange and inevitably had something to say about it. "Uh-oh, trouble already. Not a good way to start a relationship." His voice got all sing-songy at the end and I swear I almost slugged him.</P><P>"Hey, Tinkerbell, why don't you fly over to the boys' locker room and make out with Robbiepoo?" I suggested, possibly with a tone of harshness.</P><P>Oliver looked apalled that I'd said that out loud in public. "Shut up, Miley! That's supposed to be a secret!"</P><P>"Look, could you just give us like two fucking seconds alone? Damn."</P><P>"Geez, fine." He sprang from his chairs and ran out, looking like he was going to cry. What a baby.</P><P>"You didn't have to hurt his feelings, ya know. You could've just asked him nicely to leave," Lilly pointed out.</P><P>"Well, as you can probably tell, nice isn't really my strong suit. Lilly, I really just wanted to say-"</P><P>"Miley, I really don't think we should be anything more than just friends."</P><P>I felt a pang of hurt, something reminiscient of a time I didn't care to remember, back when I had a heart. "But, Lilly-"</P><P>"No, listen. I can't be with someone who's just going to run away anytime things get a little uncomfortable. Same sex relationships are a lot harder than straight couples-"</P><P>"I know."</P><P>"You don't, though. Not really. When you're dating a girl, the whole world gives you crap about it. Just Oliver nagging us was small compared to the rest of shit you'd have to put up with. And I don't know that I can trust that you won't just run off or close up if you can't handle it. And remember the other day when I yelled at you and you cried?"</P><P>I looked down at the table. "I have no idea what you're talking about."</P><P>"Yes you do. And that's what I'm talking about, right there. You won't even talk to me. You won't open up to me. Yesterday was a lot of fun but things like your favorite color or what you like to do in your free time is hardly knowledge to base a relationship on."</P><P>"Lilly, come on. We haven't even known each other that long. It's gonna take a while before I let you in on all my deep, dark secrets. I think you're overanalyzing this whole situation way too much."</P><P>"Am I?" She held my gaze then shook her head and glanced away. "This whole thing is too creepy, anyway. Dating my step-sister? That just sounds wrong."</P><P>"But, Lilly-"</P><P>"Really, Miley. I'd love it if we could be really good friends, but nothing more than that. 'Kay?" The bell rang and she gave me a sad smile before standing up to leave. "See ya later."</P><P>Yeah, Kayla, really great advice. <I>Just go talk to her. Tell her how you feel. Communication is key. </I>What a load of shit. I did talk to her. I did tell her how I felt. We had lots of communication. And look at where it got me! I'm hurting all over again, almost as bad as the time before she even came into my life. Back when the whole disaster that is my life now started. I never wanted to feel this way again, ever. That's why I turned to booze and drugs and meaningless sex. I just wanted to feel good again. And now that I was finally starting to, look where I am. The universe is totally against me, and I have no one to blame but myself.</P><P>...</P><P>I stayed in school for the rest of the day, despite my overwhelming urge to go home and raid the locked liqour cabinet (I swiped my father's key one night and made a copy). I completely ignored Lilly in our shared classes, as well as on the ride home and once we got there. I immediately sprinted into the house first and locked myself in our room, knowing that dear old Dad hadn't gotten around to making her a key yet. She banged on the door, trying to get in, but after a while she realized I wasn't going to open the door. She gave up. Just like everyone else in my life. Big surprise.</P><P>I did feel a little remorse, though, about locking myself in the room. The liqour was in the living room. However, I had stashed a bottle of vodka under the bed a couple months ago that still had about three-fourth's left. Jackpot.</P><P>I dropped down onto the floor and looked around under the bed, moving clothes and shoes out of my way until I found my elixir of life. I pulled it out and quickly unscrewed the cap. Ah, the bitter taste of vodka in the afternoon. I felt the warm liquid burn my mouth and down my throat, on its way to seep into my blood, my bones, my whole body. I lay on my bed and chugged some more, waiting for it to consume me.</P><P>...</P><P>I awoke the next morning to a pounding headache, paired with someone's fist pounding on the door. Great.</P><P>"Miley, get up! Come on, I slept on the couch last night, don't make me late, too!" Lilly's voice slipped through the cracks in the door and filled the room at an alarmingly loud volume. I cringed before sliding off the bed and slowly making my way to the door, unlocking it and opening it for her. I'm so nice. "Oh, my god. Miley, what happened to you?"</P><P>"Do you have to be so goddamned loud?" I asked, turning away and heading back towards the bed.</P><P>"I'm barely speaking above a whisper..." Her voice trailed off as her eyes flew to the empty vodka bottle on the floor and she sighed. "Seriously? Come on. Where did you get this?" She picked it up and held it out to me.</P><P>"My awesome daddy's liquor cabinet."</P><P>"Oh, god, Miley. Someone tells you something you don't wanna hear so you get wasted? Ugh, you look a mess. How are you gonna go to school?"</P><P>"Who said I was going to school?" I scratched my head and fell back onto the bed, stomache down.</P><P>"You have to go to school. Not only is it the law, it's the smart thing to do."</P><P>"Well given that school is supposed to make you smart and I've been going only half the mandated amount of time ever since..." I allowed my sentence to die off, not wanting to go there.</P><P>"Ever since what, Miley?" She stopped thumbing through clothes in the closet and turned to me.</P><P>I burrowed further into the comforter, covering my face in the blanket, shaking my head no. "Nothing."</P><P>"No, what is it? Is this why you turn to booze? Is this why you're so closed off? What? What is it?" I felt her weight on the bed and her hand smoothing my hair. "Tell me."</P><P>I swiveled my head to face her and stared at her for a minute before going back to my refuge of covers. "No."</P><P>"Miley-"</P><P>"I said no, okay? Just drop it."</P><P>"I'm not going to drop it, Miley. Whatever it is, it's obviously killing you inside. A person can't live like this. You can't live like this."</P><P>"Good thing I'm not really living, then. I'm just existing."</P><P>I could hear her sharp intake of breath. "God, Miley-"</P><P>"Just leave me alone. Go to school."</P><P>"I can't just leave you here alone. You need me."</P><P>I shot up so fast the room began to spin. I stared her square in the eye. "Correction: I don't need anyone. Not anymore. I've been taking care of myself for years."</P><P>"Yeah, and look where it's gotten you. Your version of taking care of yourself is getting so wasted you don't feel anything."</P><P>I looked at her blankly. "Exactly." Then I fell back down, breathing in the stifled oxygen through the cotton-filled pillow.</P><P>...</P><P>I just lay there, unmoving, for hours. I never felt Lilly leave, either. At some point, I drifted off to sleep. When I woke up, I could no longer feel her laying there. I could hear her voice, however, just outside in the hall. She was talking to my father, whom I'd assumed she'd phoned and told to come back.</P><P>"No, what I said to her, it wasn't a big deal. It wasn't enough to do this to her."</P><P>My dad sighed in response. He was talking quieter, so it wasn't as easy to hear his voice. "It doesn't take much to set her off."</P><P>"What do you mean?" Whatever my father said next, I couldn't hear it, but then came Lilly's voice again. "Depression? From what?"</P><P>There was a big pause before my dad answered that one. But he answered, nonetheless. He told Lilly everything she'd wanted to hear from me but I wasn't strong enough to tell her. "After her mom died, Miley's brother fell into a deep depression, just like the one she's in now-"</P><P>"Wait, her brother? I didn't know you have a son. Where is he?"</P><P>Another hesitant pause. This wasn't easy for him. "<I>Had </I>a son. After their mom died, Jackson got really depressed. It runs in our family, clinical depression. It's harder on teens, though, because without the medication, their going to have...suicidal...thoughts. With the drugs, though, those thoughts could be amplified. But I didn't even acknowledge his illness. I was so consumed by my own grief, I ignored my son."</P><P>"What about Miley?"</P><P>"Miley was Miley. I think she was just too young to understand what was going on around her." Wrong. I was not too young; I was not too young to notice my world crashing down around me. "Anyway, Jackson got so bad he...well, he got drunk one night at a party I didn't know he'd snuck out to. On his way home he drove his car straight into a pole...If that boy had just been wearing his seatbelt...He flew out the windshield and smashed against a tree before landing roughly on the ground...There was too much internal bleeding...He died. Essentially, he killed himself."</P><P>Lilly gasped in horror at my life. "Oh, my god. I'm so sorry Mr. Stewart. I had no idea."</P><P>"I know. Miley blames me, and that I could handle. If it were just me she put the blame on I'd be fine. But she also blames herself. She thinks that she should've done something, should've made me see what was going on and gotten Jackson help. She was so young though, I don't think she remembers how young she was." Oh, I remember. I was just much more mature for my age than Daddy could see. "There was nothing she could have done, but she can't see that. She won't. After Jackson, it was just too much on her. She'd had to watch her mother and her only brother die." I could hear my dad choking back tears, and I knew Lilly probably had a comforting hand on his shoulder. "Her depressive patterns followed those of Jackson. I was there, though. I was awake enough to see it. I wasn't going to lose another one. I got her help, and it worked for a while. Sometimes though, just the thought, the memory, of everything that happened, and she goes into a relapse. It has nothing to do with you, Lilly. Whatever you said to her, it has nothing to do with her behavior now."</P><P>Lilly just sighed, and I could tell by just that one sigh, that she was crying now too. "I'm so sorry. If I had known-"</P><P>"No, it's okay. We don't like to talk about it. You can see why."</P><P>"What can I do to help?"</P><P>"You've done enough; you helped by calling me. I'll call her psychiatrist and set her up for an appointment."</P><P>"Okay, I guess."</P><P>"Thanks, Lilly. Miley and I, we may not get along, but she's my daughter. She's all I have left. Don't get me wrong, I love your mother, and you, but Miley, she means the world to me. I'd give anything to have my little girl back."</P><P>"I know. I'll go watch TV with my mom in the living room, you can go have a minute with Miley."</P><P>"Thank you, again."</P><P>I heard her kiss my dad's cheek before her padded footsteps died out. The door creaked as my dad pushed it open, coming towards me on the bed. His weight lowered the mattress on my left side as he sat down next to where I lay, smoothing my hair with his hand just like Lilly had done hours ago.</P><P>"Miley, baby, I'm so sorry," he leaned down and kissed my hair, then rested his forehead against my temple, "I'm so sorry." I felt a tear splash on my cheek, and knew that it wasn't mine. It was only a matter of seconds before my own tear ducts kicked into action, though.</P><P>I sat up, surprising him, and looked at his crying face that matched my own. He gazed at me expectantly, waiting for whatever insult or guilt trip I would hurl at him. But you know what? In that instant, I was so tired of fighting him, fighting everyone. I just broke down. "I'm sorry too, Daddy," I cried, throwing my arms around his neck and sobbing into his shoulder. "I'm sorry that I've been such a bitch to you. And I'm sorry that I blamed you for Momma and Jackson. And I'm sorry everything I've done. I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry."</P><P>He held me with one hand on my head and one on my back, rocking me. It felt just like when I was little and I'd gotten hurt trying to ride a bike, and he'd rock me back and forth until I stopped crying. His hands still felt as big as they did back then. "Shh, it's okay, baby. It's okay."</P><P>I just sobbed and sobbed.</P><P><B>okay, so that was quite the unexpected turn, don't you think? most of you probably hated it, and i'm not even sure if i like it. it just felt right. idk. it's hard to explain. anyway, there it is. love it, hate it, just tell me in a review. sorry if it makes you wanna drop the story or what have you. i just thought it was time for this to happen. anyway, review please. that would be lovely.</B></P>
