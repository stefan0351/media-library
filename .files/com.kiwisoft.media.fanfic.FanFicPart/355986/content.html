<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Five -->

<p>Ashleigh was sitting on her couch comfortably; her feet propped up on her glass coffee table. She was immersed in a book, thinking about Cassidy from time to time; she was dressed comfortably, in a white tank top and black shorts, feet bare. She was wondering how it was going with Andrea, if this would be the night when she would tell her how deep her feelings really were. <i>But then again,</i> Ashleigh thought, reprimanding herself. <i>I should know better.</i></p>
		<p>She'd gotten home from the gym and gone right to sleep, knowing full well that she'd be staying up that night. It was almost twelve now, and Cassidy had just called to let her know that she was about a half-hour away from her. Ashleigh, as soon as she'd heard the husky voice with the Portuguese accent, had felt a prickle of excitement rush through her body. She lost her concentration on the book, thinking of Cassidy's voice playing against her ear as they had sex, the very sexy things she'd say to her as she touched her, as Ashleigh touched <i>her</i>.</p>
		<p>A damp quiver between her legs answered the sound of her musical doorbell. She stood up and went to the door, opening it to Cassidy, who held a bottle of expensive red wine in one hand, two shiny wineglasses cradled against the other. Taking a sharp breath, she allowed her eyes to take in Cassidy's sensuously lithe body, the strength of her legs, of her arms.</p>
		<p>Gesturing for her to come in, she removed the bottle of wine from Cassidy's hand. She hastily pulled her into an embrace and took possession of her lips, pushing her tongue into the waiting mouth and feeling a jolt of pleasure rush through her body. Cassidy responded, feeling her own body react to Ashleigh's, surging against hers. It was all she could do to not drop the two fragile glasses in her hand. She felt the bottle of cool wine in Ashleigh's hand press against the small of her back, and that turned her on even more. A warm wet feeling between her legs spread onto her underwear and shorts. She was wet beyond redemption, and she pulled away to place the glasses on the small table by the door.</p>
		<p>She turned back to Ashleigh and wrapped her arms around the small waist, kicking the door closed and pushing her towards the couch. Ashleigh's strong arms wrapped around her shoulders, holding her from falling. Their tongues were exploring, their hands squeezing taut muscles and touching soft skin. Cassidy's face was on Ashleigh's neck, her tongue and lips playing with the sensitive area below her ear. Ashleigh was moaning, her shaking hands struggling with the wine bottle, attempting to uncork it as Cassidy's strong body worked over hers. She felt the soft lips leave her as Cassidy pulled away from her and took the bottle away. She uncorked it with her bare hands and took a mouth full from the bottle. Leaning forward, lingering over Ashleigh, she brought her lips to hers and allowed the now warm liquid to go from her mouth to the other. Ashleigh groaned, deeply, and swallowed the delicious wine.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh was completely naked in seconds.</p>
		<p>She arched as Cassidy poured the cool, tasty wine over her painfully engorged nipples and the flat plain of her stomach. She shuddered as the silky lips suckled the wine from her skin and nipples. Cassidy poured again, and finished the wine on her. Feeling her own body trembling and quivering between her legs, she grabbed the long neck of the bottle, and brought it between Ashleigh's wide-open thighs. Ashleigh gasped as she was entered, as the neck was brought in as far as it would go. She moaned, her fingers gripping Cassidy's back frantically.</p>
		<p>She trembled violently as Cassidy began twisting the bottle slowly, at the same time maneuvering it in and out. Feeling an orgasm coiling tightly inside her as Cassidy licked her clitoris and pumped the bottle, her hips jerked erratically and a cry rose in her throat. Her arms around Cassidy's shoulders, her fingers pressing against the line of her lean back, pressed harder. Cassidy pulled the bottle out, opened her legs wider inserting her tongue into her to feel the tight tremors of the flooded walls inside her. Her lips pressing against the flesh to feel the intense wetness of her making.</p>
		<p>With a strong high thrust of her hips, Ashleigh came into Cassidy's mouth, wave after wave of intensity coming and coming. She lay sweating and exhausted on the couch afterwards, Cassidy on top of her, sweating too. They were kissing slowly and deeply, as they always did, after a mind-blowing session of sex. "Will you stay the night?" Ashleigh asked, wanting to please her just as she'd been pleased.</p>
		<p>Cassidy laid her head on her shoulder and nodded, feeling drowsy and ready to sleep. "Did you have fun?" She asked softly, a smile played across her lips.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh playfully smacked one of her tight butt-cheeks, and Cassidy jumped. "You know it's not necessary to ask!" She chuckled. She groaned as Cassidy's hips began pressing between her legs rhythmically. "Oh, no, you don't!" She gasped and managed to swing them around so that she was now on top. Her hand went into Cassidy's shorts and between Cassidy's legs and she inserted her fingers into the heated wetness that was coming from deep inside. Cassidy thrust her hips upwards and she cried out, loosing herself to Ashleigh's strong expert fingers.</p>
		<p>The next morning, as they had breakfast, showered and half-dressed; they spoke quietly between bites of egg and cheese sandwiches. Cassidy was mostly silent, and Ashleigh finally ended up just staring at her. Cassidy's eyes were attached to the plate on the table in front of her; she nibbled on her sandwich. <i>God,</i> Ashleigh thought amusedly. <i>She could be so adorably shy sometimes. It's hard to tell we had mind-blowing sex just last night.</i></p>
		<p>"Cassidy," She said, reaching across the table and taking Cassidy's hand. "How was dinner with Andrea?" She asked when Cassidy met her eyes.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, her, mind going back to thoughts of Andrea. "It was great." She said softly, her eyes veering away from Ashleigh's.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled. "What did you guys do?" She asked gently, squeezing Cassidy's hand comfortingly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, staring down at their hands. "We mostly talked about things between us; you know, our friendship and stuff. She asked me if I wanted to have a picnic with her in a couple of weeks..." She paused. "I couldn't say no."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh sat back on her chair and smacked the table aggressively. "And why should you say no?" She inquired.</p>
		<p>Cassidy shrugged, looking everywhere except Ashleigh's eyes. She started to say: "Well, you know Jeffrey and every-"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smacked the table even harder. The plates, the cups, everything rattled. "Jeffrey!" She exclaimed, surprising even Cassidy, who knew her very well. And knew that she didn't usually explode in this manner. Ashleigh was known for her calm demeanor and her never exploding temper. At Crystal City Hospital, Ashleigh was known by only a few to have a volatile temperament and those were the stupid ones who tried her patience. "Fuck Jeffrey!" She said with clenched teeth.</p>
		<p>"Ash-" Cassidy said uncertainly.</p>
		<p>"You're her best friend," Ashleigh continued, as if Cassidy hadn't said anything. "He cannot go there, and if Andy were to let him, she'd be the fool." She looked at Cassidy with angry green eyes. "And you know," She wagged a long finger at her. "You're the bigger fool for letting him win the battles, by not even <i>trying</i> to win her heart in the way that you want it." She stood up and walked away from the table to lean against the light wood cabinets with strong arms crossed, her eyes locked to Cassidy's in a reprimanding way.</p>
		<p>Cassidy stared back at her with surprised eyes. "Ashleigh," She said hesitantly, afraid she'd be interrupted again. When Ashleigh didn't say anything, just staring at her in her intimidating manner, she continued: "I just don't think I should involve myself in their relationship..."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh stopped her with a sharp gesture; her hand sliced through the air. "It's not about getting involved, Cassidy," She said intensely, almost growling at her. "It's about taking what belongs to <i>you</i>. It's about telling Andrea Cates that you are in love with her, that you love her like no one ever could. That you'd give your life to her with all the passion and love in the world."</p>
		<p>Cassidy stared at the plate on the table, feeling her eyes wet with tears, her hands playing at her lap. She held back the tears and looked up to stare at her. "I will never tell Andy my true feelings for her." She said firmly, standing up from the table and leaving the kitchen and Ashleigh behind.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh watched her go, smiling to herself; she was satisfied that she'd gotten through the hard exterior Cassidy had built for herself. Minutes later, she heard Cassidy's footsteps returning towards the kitchen. She was fully dressed now, holding her jacket at the crook of her arm. She shuffled at the threshold, unable to look into Ashleigh's eyes. "You're going," Ashleigh whispered, only slightly disappointed. Still, she was satisfied she got through the tough exterior, got some emotion to show through the mask. For as long as she'd known Cassidy, she'd never seen her show so much as an ounce of emotion, except the one time they were at the gym. But Cassidy had pushed the display away without so much as a backward glance, as if it had never happened. She knew Cassidy had a lot to think about. "When will I see you again?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"Some time this week, Ash." Cassidy said softly. "I'll call you." She turned and walked away, leaving the apartment quietly.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She was in her car, waiting for the light to turn from red to green. She pulled her cellular out of her jacket pocket and dialed. Robie picked up on the third ring. She sounded glad to hear from Cassidy. "Well hello, stranger!" She said, a smile on her voice. Last time she'd heard from her had been Sunday. She'd tried to call her, but had been unable to communicate through the cellular; Cassidy had turned it off. "Where were you, woman?" She asked playfully.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, chuckling softly. "I hung out with Andrea last night, we had dinner," She said, pretending to be thoughtful. The light turned green; with one hand on the steering wheel, she pressed her foot softly on the gas pedal. "Then I hung out with Ashleigh. And that's it."</p>
		<p>Robie chuckled also. She teased: "Hung out with Ashleigh, isn't that the doctor you're..."</p>
		<p>"<i>Yes</i>, Robie," Cassidy said, trying to hold back her laughter. "That's the doctor who treated me a few years ago."</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay. I get it." Robie said, laughing. "So how was dinner with Andrea?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy stopped at another light. "It was great, we talked a lot." She said, and nothing more, suddenly quiet and apprehensive.</p>
		<p>Robie shook her head, knowing full well that Cassidy had just clamped up on her. She tried another tactic, knowing full well how to get around her. "Why don't you come over later, Cassidy?" She asked soothingly. "I'll cook you dinner..."</p>
		<p>Cassidy was soothed by her voice, and she nodded. Catching herself, she said: "Yes, okay."</p>
		<p>Robie smiled, already thinking of what she would cook for her. "Okay, then," She said. "What time do you want to come over?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled. "At nine or so? I have some people to see today." She said.</p>
		<p>"No other girlfriends, I hope." Robie said warningly, a smile hidden in her voice.</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed, driving off when the light changed and making a left on Grand Place. She lived about five blocks away. "No, just friends. Gretchen and George." She said.</p>
		<p>"Good, tell them I said hi, and that I'll talk to them later," Robie said. "See you at nine."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From his uptown office, Jeffrey dialed the number he knew Andrea would be at that time. She would be on her lunch hour, most definitely sitting behind the desk in the small office she shared with another teacher. Maybe she was with that young woman, Roxanne, he thought her name was, chatting away like usual. He wanted to talk to her, though, and he didn't care whom she was talking to or if she was talking to somebody. The phone rang three times and Andrea picked up with a warming hello. "Hey, hon." He said, not able to hold back a smile at just the sound of her voice.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Jeff." Andrea said, sounding glad to hear from him. "How are you?"</p>
		<p>Jeffrey felt warm all over. "I'm fine, baby. What about you?" He replied, really wanting to instantly ask about her dinner with Cassidy. When Andrea told him she was having dinner with an air of finality seldom in her voice, he knew better than to even argue with her. Or to say that he really wanted her to come to dinner with him and his business friends instead, because he knew she would say no to anything just to be with Cassidy Monsignor. Just the thought of her angered him intensely, he always tried to control that anger around Andrea, and it was very hard.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine too," Andrea said. "How did your dinner go?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"It went great..." He said softly. "I thought a lot about you, though."</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled from her side of the line. "That's sweet, Jeff." She said softly. "I thought about you too." She was lying, the only thing in her mind the night before was Cassidy, and Cassidy only.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey brightened. "Did you, really?" He asked, feeling like everything was fine again. He was having a hard time the night before, just thinking that Andrea was alone with Cassidy. That Cassidy could manipulate her into having... He shook his head vehemently; just the thought disgusted him.</p>
		<p>"I did." Andrea said softly, trying to soothe him. He was so much like a child sometimes. She was alone in the office, but she didn't really want to be on the phone with him for some reason. She'd just spent the last twenty-five minutes staring at the wall, thinking of what she'd bring with her the day of her picnic with Cassidy. The phone sliced through her happy thoughts like a knife through thread. "Jeffy, I have to go." She said softly, trying to sound apologetic. Not really feeling that way. "Call me at home tonight, will you?"</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smiled. "Okay," He said. "I will. Maybe I'll pass by."</p>
		<p>Andrea said okay, and hung up with him. She sat back on her chair and stared at the wall again, contemplating once again what she would bring with her to the picnic.</p>
