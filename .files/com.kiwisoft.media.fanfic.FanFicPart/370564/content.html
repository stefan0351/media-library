<p>The early summer sunshine streamed down over Camp Algonkian Island. The trim on the twenty-two cabins was brightly painted, the excellent athletic fields had been freshly mowed, and an assortment of boats of all sizes bobbed in readiness at the dock. The campers would begin arriving right after lunch. Everything was prepared for the opening of the camp's thirty-first season.</p>
<p>A shaft of light came through the window of the camp office, shining directly upon the solemn portrait of Elias Warden, the camp founder, and glaring off the glass. The present camp director, Linda Warden, granddaughter of Elias, sat at her desk, checking the final preparations for the new camp year. There was a record enrollment for this first month, she noted with satisfaction. How lovely that would look on the bank statement!</p>
<p>She noticed a letter on the corner of her desk, opened it and examined the contents.</p>
<p><i>Dear Ms. Warden,</i> it read, <i>I am writing this letter in regard to my baby girl, Miley Stewart, who is registered at your camp for the first month. I thought that you and your counselors should be forewarned. Miley is an exceptional but difficult girl. You may have considerable problems getting her adjusted to camp life. She is something of a loner, and does not always get along with other girls. In addition, she insists that she does not want to go to camp. However, I'm sending her to Algonkian Island on the advice of her school guidance department. They feel that she ought to be placed in a social atmosphere where she'll be exposed to all sorts of people, an atmosphere of hearty physical activity mixed with healthy comradeship.</i></p>
<p>Ms. Warden looked up. "What an excellent description of camp!" she said aloud.</p>
<p><i>When Miley arrives,</i> the letter went on, <i>it is very likely that she will have a pretty negative attitude. I hope you and your staff will be patient with her. Don't hesitate to call me if there's a problem. Sincerely, Robby Ray Stewart.</i></p>
<p>Ms. Warden snorted loudly. "Problems! There is no such thing as a problem girl—only problem parents. All cats love meat, and all kids love camp. That's the way it was in the days of my grandfather—that's the way it is now. This girl is about to have the best summer of her life!" She got up from her desk, strode out onto her front porch and looked out over the compound, still holding the letter.</p>
<p>A group of tall, athletic young women, dressed alike in white Algonkian uniforms, were moving about putting the finishing touches on the grounds in preparation for the arrival of their charges.</p>
<p>Marina, the head counselor, loped over to Ms. Warden's cottage. "Good morning, ma'am. We're all set here. Are there any last minute problems we should know about?"</p>
<p>Ms. Warden glanced briefly towards the letter in her hand, crumpled it up and tossed it into the nearest trash container. "Never any problems at Algonkian Island. Just routine, girls, just routine."</p>
<p>She turned away and walked briskly back into her office. By the time she was again seated at her desk, Miley Stewart had completely vanished from her mind.</p>
<p>The large silver motor launch chugged loudly up to the island dock and scraped against the old tires that covered the wood. The driver skillfully threw a rope around a post and secured the boat.</p>
<p>He turned to his nine young passengers. "Well, we're here, young ladies. Camp Algonkian Island. Everybody out."</p>
<p>There was a scrambling and happy chatter as eight of the girls heaved themselves and their luggage out of the launch. Once on the dock they scattered, heading for the assorted small buildings on the island. There were welcoming shouts as girls already there ran to greet the new arrivals.</p>
<p>The driver glanced at the lone passenger still seated at the rear of the launch. "Hey, what are you, asleep or something? We're here."</p>
<p>"So I see," the chestnut-haired girl observed glumly. She did not move.</p>
<p>"Well?" prompted the driver. "Aren't you getting out?"</p>
<p>"No," said the girl blandly. "I'm hoping you won't notice me so I can hitch a ride back to civilization."</p>
<p>"Aw, c'mon," kidded the driver. "You're going to have a great time here."</p>
<p>"I doubt it," said the girl, heaving her duffle bag onto the dock and climbing out after it. "But thanks for the thought."</p>
<p>Miley Stewart watched regretfully as the motor launch pulled away from the dock and headed for the mainland. There went her last link with the outside world. Like it or not—and she did not like it—Camp Algonkian Island was home for the next month.</p>
<p>"You'll love it, bud," her dad had assured her at the bus station earlier that day. "The sports facilities are the best available. And there will be so many other girls your own age to hang out with."</p>
<p>Well, the latter was certainly true, at least. She had come up on the bus and over on the launch with eight others, and there were hundreds more swarming all over what she could see of the island, every one obviously delighted to be here. Miley abandoned all attempts to understand such an attitude. She was here thanks to the school guidance department. Thanks, but no thanks. Guidance should stick to timetabling and stay out of other people's heads!</p>
<p>A slim young woman with a clipboard loped up and grinned into Miley's face. "Ah, here you are, the ninth girl from the launch. You must be Stewart."</p>
<p>Miley nodded noncommittally.</p>
<p>"Hi. I'm Lauren, the swimming coach. You're in Cabin 13, right over there." She indicated the row of small, wood-frame buildings which lined the camp's central compound.</p>
<p>"Thirteen," repeated Miley softly, "Marvelous."</p>
<p>"You're new here, eh?" said Lauren brightly. "This is your first summer at Algonkian?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "And hopefully my last."</p>
<p>Lauren stared at her momentarily, then went on. "I'm making up my life-saving class. What level of swimming are you at?"</p>
<p>Miley thought carefully. "What comes before tadpole?"</p>
<p>"Before tadpole?" the instructor repeated. "Non-swimmer…oh, well, we'll have you swimming soon enough. By the time this month is over you'll be a regular ocean-going vessel."</p>
<p>"I doubt it," said Miley calmly. She slung her duffle bag over her shoulder and walked across the compound along one of the many well-worn paths, this one leading to Cabin 13.</p>
<p>Standing in the doorway was another athletic-looking young woman, dressed like Lauren in an Algonkian T-shirt, shorts, white socks and track shoes, and sporting a whistle around her neck. On her face was Lauren's elaborate grin. Miley looked back at Lauren and then again at the counselor of Cabin 13. A clone, she decided. There were two of them.</p>
<p>"Hi, there!" the clone greeted her with a hearty wave. "I'm Trina, your bunk counselor. What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Just put me down as Anonymous," said Miley.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Trina glanced at the tag on the duffle bag. "Miley Stewart. Welcome aboard, Stewart. You're the first to arrive. You've got the pick of the bunks."</p>
<p>Miley stepped inside and looked around with distaste.</p>
<p>There were three double-decker bunk beds in a line on each side of the room, and a small private bedroom at the front, just inside the door. Miley went into the private room and sat down on the bed.</p>
<p>"I'll have this one," she decided.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said Trina seriously. "This is the counselor's room. I sleep here. But you can have your pick of all the others."</p>
<p>"Not much privacy out there," Miley remarked mildly.</p>
<p>"Hey, you don't need privacy! We're all going to be one big happy family, and we're going to have lots of fun!"</p>
<p>Miley glared at her, shook her head resignedly and walked out of the small room. Once again she surveyed the bunks, and selecting the lower bed in one of the far corners, stuffed her duffle underneath and threw herself down on the thin mattress.</p>
<p>"That's right," Trina said approvingly. "You just make yourself comfortable. I'm going to stand outside and greet the rest of the girls." She stepped out the front door.</p>
<p>Miley looked around thoughtfully. Soon the other bunks would be occupied and the room would be burgeoning with bodies. She stood up and pulled the sheets off the bunk directly above her. Then, stuffing the ends in under the upper mattress, she let the sheets fall to the floor, completely draping her own bed off from the rest of the room. She crawled inside, dragging her duffle bag with her. Behind the sheet there was a flurry of activity. Then a hand appeared and affixed a neatly-lettered sign to the drape by means of a sticky band aid. It read: <i>DO NOT DISTURB</i>.</p>
<p>Ah, she thought, lying down in seclusion, privacy. Pulling an iPod out of the duffle, she placed the ear buds in her ears and set the volume to maximum.</p>
<p>Lilly Truscott trudged slowly along the pathway to Cabin 13, her new suitcase dragging at her hand and her guitar slung over her bony shoulder. The sun was too hot. She felt as though her pale skin was burning already. Camp, she reflected, was everything she had expected it to be—big, strange, isolated and generally rotten. If this was her parents' idea of a reward for getting top marks in school, she thanked her lucky stars that she hadn't flunked. That probably would have meant the rack. As it was, she had been banished to this island camp for a whole month. Four weeks of nothing but sports! What a depressing thought!</p>
<p>From inside the cabin she could hear excited chatter. Grimly, she entered. Several girls were gathered at the rear, surrounding a bunk which was shut off from the rest of the room by drapes.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me, blurted Lilly. "We're quarantined with mumps!"</p>
<p>One of the girls turned to face her. "No, it's probably just a nut."</p>
<p>"Probably?" asked Lilly. "Don't you know?"</p>
<p>"I'm not poking around in there," said another girl. "Look at the sign."</p>
<p>Lilly read the sign. "Is there anybody in there?"</p>
<p>"Who knows?" shrugged a tall girl. "My bunk is up front. Why should I worry about it?"</p>
<p>With a sinking heart, Lilly looked around. All the bunks were occupied except—except for the one right above the mysterious nut. Zonked again. Camp was getting worse by the minute. Cautiously she climbed up the small wooden ladder and looked at her bed.</p>
<p>"Hey, there are no sheets up here!"</p>
<p>"Tough," came a muffled voice from below.</p>
<p>"There <i>is</i> someone in there," whispered one of the girls.</p>
<p>"Are those my sheets?" Lilly demanded of the hidden presence.</p>
<p>"They came from up there," said the voice.</p>
<p>"Well this is where I have to sleep!" shouted Lilly.</p>
<p>Trina came bounding into the cabin. "What's going on in here? What's all the yelling about?" She stopped short at the sight of the draped bunk. "Stewart, is that you in there?" She ripped the sheets down, revealing Miley and her iPod.</p>
<p>Miley yanked the ear buds out of her ears. "I just wanted a little privacy," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Nobody comes to camp for privacy," said Trina brightly.</p>
<p>"Only because they can't get any," Miley replied. She turned over and put her ear buds back in. "Wake me up in a month."</p>
<p>Trina stared at her for a moment and then turned to Lilly. "Hi, I didn't catch you on the way in. What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Lilly Truscott," Lilly replied without much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Welcome aboard. I'm Trina, your counselor." She gestured to the rest of the girls. "Obviously Stewart's a little homesick," she said in a low voice. "We'll all have to do our best to make her feel at home."</p>
<p>"She's a nut," said Ashley, an Asian girl. "Why did our cabin have to get stuck with a nut?"</p>
<p>"Knock it off!" said Trina. "She's just homesick. She'll come around once we get into the activities. Here, Truscott, I'll help you make up your bunk."</p>
<p>The girls from Cabin 13, sweaty and tired from playing softball, came laughing and shouting into their cabin to change for dinner.</p>
<p>"Well, we lost," said Trina brightly, "but we had more fun than they did."</p>
<p>"Sure," laughed someone. "They're exhausted from all that base-running!"</p>
<p>"Wow!" exclaimed Ashley, pulling off her socks. "Thirty-seven to nothing!"</p>
<p>"A no-hitter," moaned Sarah, a short girl with platinum blond hair.</p>
<p>"That was some sacrifice bunt you hit, Truscott," exclaimed Trina with forced enthusiasm. "Too bad there was nobody on base or we would really have showed them something!"</p>
<p>Lilly smiled thinly. "Thanks." She had always hated softball. Her "bunt" had been the result of the hardest swing she could manage.</p>
<p>"Congratulations," muttered a low voice sarcastically.</p>
<p>Everybody turned. They had forgotten Miley, who was still lying on her bunk listening to her iPod.</p>
<p>"Ah, Stewart," said Trina brightly. "We missed you out there. You'll play next time."</p>
<p>"I doubt it," said Miley softly. "I don't play softball."</p>
<p>"Well," said Trina, still smiling, "dinner's in ten minutes."</p>
<p>"You <i>do</i> eat, don't you?" put in Ashley.</p>
<p>Miley cast her a withering glare.</p>
<p>The mess hall was crowded and noisy. Miley had tried to find a secluded spot to eat her dinner, but there was no such thing. Each cabin had its own table with its own clone to watch over things. There wasn't even any elbow room. She had been directed to carry her tray to table 13—that number again!—and now she found herself sitting on a hard bench right next to Lilly Truscott.</p>
<p>"Hi," said Lilly timidly.</p>
<p>Miley acknowledged this greeting with a curt nod, then shook her head and took a bite of her dinner. She chewed thoughtfully, swallowed and put down her fork.</p>
<p>She said, "What is this material?"</p>
<p>"It's beef stew," mumbled Trina, her mouth full to overflowing. "Isn't it great?"</p>
<p>"No," said Miley flatly.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, you just don't have much of an appetite because you didn't play softball," the counselor explained. "Isn't it delicious, Truscott?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked sadly at her plate. "Yeah, great," she muttered. She had not even ventured to taste it yet. Maybe it was true that a person could fast for almost a month at a time.</p>
<p>Miley stood up and lifted her plate. "Since you like it so much," she said mildly, "have mine." She delicately scraped all her stew onto Lilly's plate.</p>
<p>"Stewart, leave the table!" ordered Trina.</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Miley. She climbed over the bench and walked out of the mess hall.</p>
<p>"What a nut!" exclaimed Ashley.</p>
<p>"Yeah," agreed Amber, a slender black girl. "Why did we get stuck with her?"</p>
<p>"She's just homesick," Trina maintained. "She'll come around as soon as she realizes the fun she's missing. Just let her be."</p>
<p>"I'm not going near her," Ashley promised. "She's a nut!"</p>
<p>"Okay, lights out," announced Trina. "Because it's the first night and you're all excited, you don't have to go right to sleep. I'll be at a counselors' meeting for an hour or so. Just keep it down to a low roar." She left.</p>
<p>Instantly the girls began chattering amongst themselves. Lilly Truscott climbed up to her bunk and lay down, trying not to think of real food. She felt a kick from below.</p>
<p>"Do you have to hang there like that?" asked Miley in annoyance.</p>
<p>Lilly sat up, pulled her guitar out of its case and began to strum absently.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," groaned Miley's voice. "Music."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with music?" Lilly demanded.</p>
<p>"With music, nothing; with <i>that</i>, plenty."</p>
<p>"It's a free country!"</p>
<p>"I wish it was," sighed Miley. She rolled over resignedly and went to sleep.</p>
