<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - Putting The `Fun' In Dysfunctional -->

</p>
<p>"But you're a cheerleader," Mike argued. (Argh) </p>
<p>"Being straight is not a prerequisite for making the squad, although Mary
Cherry might change that soon." Brooke huffed annoyed. (Especially if she ever
finds out about Nicole) </p>
<p>Mary Cherry had taken the news rather well, after she got over her whole
Christian, incest was a sin and that Brooke and Sam had a first class set of
front row tickets on the express train to Hell rant. Sam had not so subtly
reminded her that not only was she so inbred that she had webbed toes and hands
but that her father was a gay drag queen. That took the wind right out of the
girls' blustery sails and she then suggested that they `bond' over the thing,
which sent Brooke and Sam running for the nearest exit post haste. But this
whole But-You're-A-Cheerleader-Syndrome was really starting to bug Brooke. </p>
<p>"Are you sure this isn't a phase or something, Brooke? All teenagers question
their sexuality from time to time." </p>
<p>"Trust me Dad, I went over that for a while. This is no phase, it's the real
deal."</p>
<p>Mike was silent for a few minutes and Brooke glanced at Sam nervously. Sam
shrugged back. </p>
<p>"Honey," Mike said finally, "you're just lonely." </p>
<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. She'd been waiting for this, expecting it. </p>
<p>"You've had some bad experiences with guys and now you're confused. Trust me,
the right guy will come along eventually and things will clear right up." Mike
smiled, apparently happy with his deduction. Sam sent her mother a desperate
glance. </p>
<p>"Mike," Jane started. </p>
<p>"Dad," Brooke broke in at the same time, standing closer to Sam now, needing
her support. "I don't think you're following the conversation." The smile faded
from Mike's face and his expression turned cold. </p>
<p>"There is nothing wrong with you, Brooke," he said simply. </p>
<p>Brooke felt her anger level rise at that statement. "I never said there was, Dad," she shot back angrily. "I said I was gay, not
wrong. The two are not mutually exclusive, you know." </p>
<p>"Brooke, calm down," Sam finally spoke up. </p>
<p>Mike turned to her with a deadly glare. "You stay out of this," he growled at her. "This is family business." </p>
<p>Right
about then all Hell broke loose in the McQueen kitchen. Jane and Brooke saw the
look of utter hurt and rejection that Sam was unable to mask from her features.
And then they watched every wall and defense she ever had go right back up
stronger then ever and her normally kind and friendly brown eyes turn dull and
cold. They both knew that Mike had just hit a particularly sore spot with Sam. </p>
<p>"You're right, Mike. I was never a part of this family and I never had any
right thinking that I was," she answered in the same cold voice Mike had used.
"But this IS my business." Instead of leaving the room, Sam continued to stare
down Mike who was unmoved. Brooke and Jane moved to stand between the two. There
was a dangerous level of tension between the two. </p>
<p>"Stop it both of you!" Jane ordered. "You're both out of line. Mike, you're
upset over Brooke's news and taking it out on Sam and Sam, you're hurt and
saying things you don't mean. Now everyone just calm down." </p>
<p>Brooke layed a
supportive hand on Sam's shoulder and was surprised to find the other girl
shaking. "Calm down, Sammy," she whispered for only Sam to hear. "He didn't mean
it." Sam looked into the loving eyes of her girlfriend and felt some of her
anger dissipate. </p>
<p>Mike was still shooting daggers at her however. He if caught any of that
little exchange, he wasn't letting on. "When did you discover this, Brooke? When did you `decide' you were gay?" he
asked contemptously. </p>
<p>Brooke sighed. (This is not going well) "I didn't `decide' anything. It just sort of developed. I started developing
feelings for someone, a woman, and they kept getting stronger and we kept
getting closer. And I realized that the reason my relationships with men never
went anywhere was because they did nothing for me, but she does." </p>
<p>"That's disgusting," Mike spat. </p>
<p>"Oh, please," Sam rolled her eyes, unable to stop herself from commenting. </p>
<p>Mike ignored her. "So who, Brooke? Who have you decided to throw your entire
future, your entire life away for, huh? Just because you have no idea what it is
you really want?" </p>
<p>Brooke couldn't believe the words coming out of her father's mouth. It was
like talking to a stranger. She looked at Sam for reassurance and Sam nodded.
Taking strength from Sam and mustering the last of her own courage, Brooke
looked her father in the eye and told him the name of the woman who had stolen
her heart and soul. </p>
<p>"Sam," she said simply. "I love, am in love with Sam."</p>
<p>Mike jumped up from his seat with a murderous glint in his eye. The only
things between him and Sam were Jane and Brooke. And both women were afraid to
think what would happen if he got his hands on Sam. Suddenly Sam's fear of wood
chippers didn't seem so foolish. "So this is your fault?" he accused
dramatically. </p>
<p>Sam glared right back at him. "My fault? Are you some sort of nutcase, Mike?" she asked in all seriousness. </p>
<p>"You did this to my little girl, didn't you? With your `ways'?" </p>
<p>Sam couldn't even begin to fathom what the Hell he was talking about. (Did he
and Mary Cherry go to the same class or something, because at least from her it
was funny) </p>
<p>"Mike, being gay isn't like a light switch you wake up one morning and
decided to flip to the `on' position. You either are or you aren't. I didn't
`do' anything to Brooke other than love her. She loves me of her own free will.
I didn't ask her to." Sam spoke calmly, not wanting to make the situation worse
no matter how hurt or angry she was. It wouldn't help anything and could
possibly lead to Brooke getting the bad end of things. She watched as Mike
turned an alarming shade of red. </p>
<p>"Get out of my house," he ordered a stunned Sam. She blinked back the sudden
tears, unwilling to give him the satisfaction. </p>
<p>"If she goes, Dad, so do I," Brooke announced firmly. She grabbed Sam's hand
tightly in her own. Mike saw this and ground his teeth together. His color
started to shift to purple. </p>
<p>"So do Mac and I," Jane added. Mike turned his attention to Jane. </p>
<p>"You knew about this?" she nodded. "How long? Why didn't you tell me?" </p>
<p>"Not long and because I was afraid of this. Mike, you need to calm down.
These two really and truly love each other," </p>
<p>Mike shook his head. "This isn't love, this is sick! I want you both out of my sight," he told Sam
and Brooke. Sam moved with Brooke closer to Jane and Mike moved out towards her.
They met in the middle of the kitchen. "You've corrupted my baby girl," he
snarled. </p>
<p>"I did no such thing, Mike," Sam responded, oddly calm. "I love your
daughter. Either accept that or don't. I don't care. But get over your narrow
minded, Christian right wing militia, hatred and ignorance before you lose your
daughter forever." To the absolute shock of everyone in the room, Mike raised
his hand to hit Sam who flinched and waited for the blow to come. </p>
<p>"Daddy no!" Booke called out as Mike's hand was raised in the air above Sam's
head. He swung his arm down and stopped mere inches away from Sam's face as
Brooke moved to intercept. </p>
<p>"Get out of my house," he repeated in a low, hushed voice. "All of you." He
turned and stomped out of the kitchen leaving the three women in stunned
silence. </p>
<p>Jane spoke first. "Sam? Are you alright?" </p>
<p>Sam nodded. "I'm fine, Mom," she said, absolutely shocked by the way things
played out. She looked over at Brooke who was still staring at the direction her
father had gone in. She turned to her mother. "Can you give us a second?" </p>
<p>Jane nodded. "I'll go get Mac ready and meet you at the car. We'll stay at a
hotel until he calms down," Jane walked over and put a hand on Brooke's
shoulder. "He'll calm down, Brooke, you'll see. This is just a shock. Give him
some time." Brooke just nodded a without saying anything and Jane wasn't sure
she understood the words. </p>
<p>Sam spared her mother a glance. "Just go, Mom, I'll take care of her," Jane
nodded and left the room. </p>
<p>Sam wrapped her arms around the still silent Brooke. "You OK?" </p>
<p>Brooke shook her head. "He was going to hurt you," she said in a voice barely her own. "He's never
hit me, no matter what I did, but he was ready to hit you." She turned to Sam
and Sam could see the tears in Brooke's eyes. She reached up and caught them as
they fell. </p>
<p>"But he didn't Brooke, he stopped himself," Sam reminded her even though her
heart was just now returning to its normal rhythm after the incident. She
thought Mike was going to hit her too, and she was again thankful they didn't
own a woodchipper. </p>
<p>"That wasn't my father," Brooke whispered in disbelief. </p>
<p>Sam sighed. "That was a man faced with a harsh reality he didn't want to
face, Brooke. Unfortunately it happens everyday. But Mike's a nice guy, when
he's not being totally insane like just now, he'll come around, you'll see," Sam
tried to reassure her even though she wasn't so sure herself. </p>
<p>Brooke sniffed and leaned into Sam. "We'd better go pack, huh?" </p>
<p>Sam nodded reluctantly. "Another glorious stay at your local Motel 6 for the
McPherson's. At least we have you and Mac to keep us company this time. Trust
me, after Mike's stuck in the Palace for a few days by himself with no daughter,
fiancée, baby, or stepdaughter to drive him crazy, he'll be begging us to come
home, homosexuality issues aside." </p>
<p>Brooke looked up at her dubiously. "God I hope you're right," she sighed holding Sam tighter, needing her
strength. </p>
<p>(So do I Princess, so do I) </p>
