<P><B>Authors Note: Thank you for all the reviews... Here's the next update..</B></p>
<P><B>Disclaimer: I own nothing except Joel. </B></p>
<P>Olivia and Viola dressed as Sebastian, sat in the circle of "ventilation", as Joel had named it, the rest of the class circled the two, who sat in the very center of the circle. The idea was to vent your feelings to your partner, in a supportive environment. The other couples had been through and Viola and Olivia were the last to go.</p>
<P>Viola had been so excited about this class, but when she had arrived Olivia refused to talk to her, even to discuss the weather. Viola was beginning to think something was wrong, especially when the venting began.</p>
<P>"Okay Olivia, do you want to go first?", asked Joel pacing around the outside of the circle.</p>
<P>Olivia nodded, and turned to Viola, Viola smiled weakly, not really understanding where this was going.</p>
<P>"Sebastian, I think you spend to much time with your friends and that you don't even tell me your going to spend time with them", said Olivia looking Viola straight in the eyes.</p>
<P>Viola made a mental note, to tell Sebastian he should not spend so much time with his friends, Viola could have sworn it was more his music that he was spending too much time with, but Olivia hadn't finished yet.</p>
<P>"Your friends, like Duke", said Olivia, Viola looked at Olivia, who smiled cruelly.</p>
<P>Then it clicked this wasn't an attack on Sebastian any more, this was an attack on Viola, Sebastian and Duke hated each other, they'd never spend time together willingly.</p>
<P>"Okay good Olivia, Sebastian is there anything you would like to say in return?", asked Joel.</p>
<P>Viola turned to look up at him.</p>
<P>"You know what Joel there is",said Viola turning to face Olivia.</p>
<P>"Then please share Sebastian", said Joel motioning for Viola to continue.</p>
<P>Viola breathed in, this was going to be hard to say, especially after everything that had just happened, after how mean Olivia was being.</p>
<P>"I just wanted to say.. that I love you", said Viola.</p>
<P>Everyone around the circle, went Awww, at Viola's words, everyone but Olivia. She looked more angry than ever, at this obvious retaliation to her comment. How could Viola toy with her feelings like that.</p>
<P>Olivia stood up and walked out, Viola took off after her.</p>
<P>"Okay everyone lets get back to the stretching", said Joel with a grin.</p>
<P>Olivia stopped just outside the hall, Viola was right behind her, Olivia turned around to see, Viola slow to a walk.</p>
<P>"How dare you!", said Olivia walking up to Viola.</p>
<P>"How dare I, how about you, what I do with Duke is none of your business", said Viola, matching Olivia's anger.</p>
<P>"You never tell me anything, you don't want to let me in!", yelled Olivia.</p>
<P>"Do you really think I would let you in, when you act like this", said Viola motioning to Olivia's current state.</p>
<P>"I just can't believe you'd get back together with him and wouldn't tell me", said Olivia turning from Viola to hide her tears.</p>
<P>"Maybe you should go with that feeling instead of jumping to conclusions, geez Duke and I are nothing but <B>friends</B>", said Viola getting frustrated.</p>
<P>Olivia looked taken back, now she felt bad.</p>
<P>"Do you bug Sebastian this much. Damn now I know how he feels", said Viola and as soon as the words left her mouth she regretted them. Olivia looked at her the tears trailing down her cheeks.</p>
<P>"Is that what you think?", asked Olivia in disbelief, she turned on her heels and ran, not even waiting for the answer.</p>
<P>"Olivia, wait, wait!" yelled Viola as Olivia took off in the general direction of her dorm room.</p>
<P>Viola was about to run after her when Joel came up behind her, putting a hand on her shoulder he tried to be reassuring.</p>
<P>"Don't Sebastian, she needs time, when its gone its gone. Come in and do some stretching, take your mind off her", said Joel with a smile.</p>
<P>"No thanks", said Viola pulling away and walking the opposite direction to Olivia, she didn't want to take her mind off Olivia.</p>
<P>"You still owe me money for the lessons, don't forget about the picnic this weekend, you can pay me then", yelled Joel after her.</p>
<P>Viola climbed into her bed and pulled the covers around her, she lay like this for sometime, sleep was not so forth coming, the anger towards herself more than anyone else was making it hard to find peace. Her head just wouldn't stop thudding, every time she got close to sleep the thudding would continue.</p>
<P>Olivia got to her dorm room, to find Sebastian with his guitar, in his usual bean bag, he put down the guitar as she came in and sat waiting for her to say something. But she didn't say anything instead she walked over to him, placing one foot on either side of his legs and lowered herself into his lap. Sebastian wasn't sure if being a good boyfriend would mean asking Olivia to stop and talk instead of rushing into it, not that they hadn't done it before, but he was sure he should stop her, but he didn't. Olivia started kissing him, she kissed the pain away, not his but hers. The pain of losing Viola, the certainty that it was over, and she attempted to force herself into believing Sebastian was his sister dressed up, though deep down she knew exactly what it was she was doing, but she was too upset to register it and thats what lead them both to the bedroom.</p>
<P><B>Authors Note: Has Olivia made a terrible mistake? Can Viola make it right? Will Sebastian work out whats going on? Whats going to happen at the picnic? Find out next chapter but read and review first... </B></p>
