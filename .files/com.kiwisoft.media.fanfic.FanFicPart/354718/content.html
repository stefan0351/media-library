<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 8 -->

<P>"Well Mr. Paris seems quiet." Harry looked at Neelix as he said. "Too quiet." Neelix made a dismissive gesture. "He's been quiet, respectful, and careful to only see them as necessary." Chakotay chimed in from his chair in his quarters. "Yes, but Paris has never given up this easily." While all of the men considered it absurd on some level they had been having the meetings since they had become chaperones for the budding romance between B'Elanna Torres and Seven of Nine. Harry was the next to speak. "Well, how have Seven and B'Elanna been doing?" Chakotay smirked. "Well they say they will have a working prototype by next week. Which has stopped the grumbling that covering their shifts was causing."</P>
<P>Neelix had a snort of laughter. "Yes, the crew has been saying that if letting those two have romantic rendezvous in the science lab will get them home sooner then they would volunteer to play the violin outside." Chakotay examined the morale officer seriously. "So the crew isn't objecting?" Neelix sounded enthusiastic. "Objecting? They're rejoicing! Not only are they building our way to Earth but they are being NICE about it." Harry Kim scoffed. "Nice?" Neelix continued his enthusiastic monologue. "Yes! Seven's mind is finally thinking of something besides efficiency." Neelix took his voice to a purr.</P>
<P>"Or more to say she's thinking ways to do other things efficiently. B'Elanna, well B'Elanna seems far less tense." Chakotay held up a hand to stop the speculation. "So things seem good on that front." Chakotay had realized the same, but needed to hear what the crew was thinking. He came to the simple conclusion that if you gave the women each other and a project to work on and they would be happy. Though they would not get to lock themselves away like they are doing with the improved warp engine he knew the ship was always in need of improvements. Though if this engine worked out they wouldn't have long before they would start encountering deep space vessels from the Alpha Quadrant.</P>
<P>He knew they would have to cross the bridge when they got to it. He knew the Federation thought of them as "the Maquis". He also knew that she was part of his Maquis crew and he would do everything in his power to protect her. The problem now was Seven. He knew she would be of far more interest to the Federation then some Maquis engineer. Yet that Maquis engineer would challenge the whole Federation to protect her drone. That was her personality, and his talks with B'Elanna reinforced the notion. He just hoped that the Admirals would realize Seven would be a greater tactical asset alive then she ever would as a dissected specimen. Partly because he knew that part of defending B'Elanna would be defending her, but when he thought about it honestly he had to admit the same qualities that led him to become B'Elanna's friend were leading him to think of Seven as one as well.</P>
<P>The other two officers brought him back by wrangling over the potential actions of Ensign Paris. "Gentleman! Gentleman! We're keeping an eye on Tom, and we can't do anything based on suspicions. Maybe it's the fact we are having actual meetings but the fact of the matter is so far, so good." Harry's face got a dark grin. "Yes, but this is the U.S.S. Voyager, can that last?" Chakotay shrugged. "I don't know, that's why we are continuing the meetings."</P>

<P>Captain Janeway's voice echoed in the cavernous shuttle bay. "How are we doing?" The sounds of movement greeted Captain Janeway as she made her way to the shuttle's hatch. The sight of her astrometrics officer lying on her back greeted her. Her chief engineer was sitting near by, but Janeway noticed the PADDs on the other side of Seven which told her that her chief engineer had been lying across Seven's abdomen as she worked. While B'Elanna seemed slightly red in the face Seven gave no indication she was flat on her back as she turned her head to her superior officer. "We are ready to begin the testing phase."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled as she nodded. "Excellent." Her voice dropped slightly. "That's one of the reasons I came down here to speak to the both of you. We know that in any testing phase there is a test pilot, and we have had a volunteer." While she knew both women had been growing closer she was given a graphic example as B'Elanna Torres fixed her with a gaze as cold as any Seven of Nine ever had. The fact she was facing it from both women caused her to sigh. "Ensign Paris is our best pilot, and has said he wants to do what he can to help." When both women continued to stare Janeway shook her head. "I've already allowed it. I just wanted you two to know in advance."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's voice was still cool. "Thank you Captain." Janeway nodded a bit and walked out of the shuttle bay. The two women looked at each other and their expressions were anything but cold. Seven had yet to rise from her position lying on the floor. "What are your feelings about this?" B'Elanna let out a breath. "He IS the best pilot, my feelings won't change that. He's also been keeping his distance, but I'm still nervous. Then I think I'm just being paranoid and not giving Tom any credit." Torres was on Seven's left side, which had her enhanced hand moving up to rest on B'Elanna's thigh. Her weight seemed to shift on its own to press into Seven's touch as Seven spoke. "Regardless of the cause Ensign Paris earned your distrust."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled as she laid down again, this time resting her head on Seven's left shoulder. "Thank you." While she was too close to see it she felt Seven's brow arch. "What are you thanking me for?" B'Elanna smiled and snuggled closer. "For accepting how I feel. Not judging or evaluating it, just accepting it." The human hand reached around to play with B'Elanna's hair and it caused a sigh of contentment to slip past the klingon's lips. "I love you." Seven replied immediately, but her voice was very quiet, shy, the words showing how new the expression was to her. "I love you too."</P>

<P>Chakotay never liked Tom Paris. While he had gotten over much of his original antipathy he never grew to trust him either. That mistrust was in full force at the moment. It was Alpha shift and his chair allowed him to keep an eye on the helmsman, and he did not like what he saw. Tom Paris seemed a little TOO together, TOO calm, and he had ever since Neelix had pulled him away from Cargo Bay Two. Some would say Chakotay was being paranoid, but they probably didn't realize that Chakotay was able the proverbial voice of experience having known Tom Paris long before he had ever set foot on Voyager. Tom Paris was far too self-centered to let go of something he thought of as "his" and far too arrogant to step aside with out being shoved there.</P>
<P>He could see Kathryn Janeway from the corner of his eye. He knew that she shared his concerns about Tom Paris, but didn't share his mistrust. For some reason she seemed to think Paris had some untapped potential. Of course the fact he was the son of her mentor had to play some part, and that was one of the things that aggravated Chakotay most of all. Not only had Paris been alternating between riding daddy's coat tails while hiding behind daddy's rank. He also treated his father like dirt, spitting on his father's legacy while enjoying all its benefits. Even when Chakotay rejected his heritage he made the break clean and didn't drag his people through the mud with him.</P>
<P>Ironically it was Tom's best friend that seemed to agree with Chakotay. That said something in and of itself the fact that his best friend and his worst enemy seemed to agree that he could not be trusted. Though he found he could not blame Voyager's cook for trusting the helmsman. Thomas Eugene Paris had been using people all his life, and unless you knew him he was entirely believable. It was only hard-earned experience that kept Chakotay wary and even now he was willing to listen to Neelix protest the officer's innocence. He was willing to listen, but had yet to believe it.</P>
<P>They were entering the enhanced warp engines testing phase, and as soon as he saw the name "Tom Paris" listed as the vessel's test pilot an alarm went off in his head. Seven and B'Elanna were finishing the enhancements to a shuttlecraft's engine and by tomorrow or the next day it would be ready for its maiden voyage. Yet the project is what brought the women together, and by volunteering Tom Paris had managed to get himself a spot close to both women.</P>
<P>That fact alone wanted to make him alert security, but with out cause it would go no where. So Chakotay came up with the next best thing. The idea came upon him suddenly and it made him want to smile. As the second best pilot on Voyager there would be no one better to copilot for Ensign Paris for such an important flight. The first officer was still smiling as he started entering information into the console in his armrest.</P>
