<!-- Darkness and Light \ null -->

<p>It should have been routine. It should have been simple and easy, black and white, and a thousand other things that it would never end up being. It was blurry and undefined. It was sloppy and wrong, something it was never planned to be...something completely different from any scenario that passed through their heads that night. It was a mess. A fist clenching, stomach churning, jaw setting un-fucking-believable mess. And the only solid problem was that there was no one to blame.</p>
<p>Dinah turned her back for a split-second, a breath, and in that second the tables turned so hard and fast she found herself sick from the spinning. She felt strong arms fold around her from behind, squeezing roughly. Her feet left the ground as she tried to kick herself free. She felt hot breath near her face as she inhaled the unearthly stench of whiskey and grimy sweat. Dinah closed her eyes when she felt herself moving forward, down actually, towards the concrete. </p>
<p>Greasy strands of straggly brown hair fell across her face as she hit the ground. She immediately felt the trickle of blood sliding down her face from above her left eye as she continued to struggle against her attacker. He wasn't a hardened criminal. He wasn't even metahuman. He was just a homeless looking mugger that tried to grab a nice old lady's purse as Dinah and Helena had been carrying the Chinese food back to the Hummer. He was normal...just a mugger. But for some reason Dinah couldn't manage to free herself. He was so strong. And she was still learning.</p>
<p>Dinah heard a clicking, an ejection, a small noise that could have been anything but registered in her mind as only one. He had a weapon and she knew it was a knife when she felt the sharp tip digging into the side of her jean jacket. She tried to concentrate her mind on some form of anger...to concentrate on any one particular thing so she could throw him off of her using her mind. But more than anything she was starting to panic and it wasn't working. She wondered what was taking Helena .</p>
<p>Just as she was ready to give up and slip into completely hopeless shrieking mode, she felt the weight on her back suddenly leave extremely quickly. Dinah rolled onto her side and looked up to see the dark, primal crime fighter turning on her prey as he careened into side of the building and slumped to the ground, gleaming silver switchblade falling to the ground beside him. Helena prowled forward quickly and smoothly, kicking the knife to the side and grabbing at the man's military jacket to raise his face to her fist. </p>
<p>Dinah reached up to her face and felt the warm wetness of a steady stream of blood. When she pulled her fingers away they were completely coated in red. Her ears were pounding with the reverberating sound of flesh hitting flesh and the occasional odd smacking of fist on bone. When she looked up again, Helena was crouching on top of the mugger relentlessly punching him in the face over and over again. There was so much blood, Dinah couldn't even make out his features, his scraggly beard, nothing. His eyes even seemed to be swelling shut. Helena was muttering something under her breath, incoherent; Dinah strained to hear but still couldn't make it out. The brunette wasn't stopping.</p>
<p>Dinah scrambled to her feet and rushed forward as Helena started banging the man's head into the ground, sending blood all over the wall and concrete below them. The blonde knew it didn't look good. She could sense the tension flowing from the brunette's body from ten feet away. As Helena pulled back again, Dinah threw a hand out to stop her.</p>
<p>"Helena, no," she yelled, grabbing the brunette's wrist and pulling back. "Stop."</p>
<p>Silence answered her. That and a low growl as Helena pulled her hand out of Dinah's grasp and swung back at the blonde to push her off without turning around. Dinah caught Helena's fist on the exact spot on her face that was already torn and bleeding. She stumbled backwards, hand immediately flying to her eye and covering it as the pain shot up and down the left side of her face. Helena's fist went down again like she hadn't even heard Dinah at all. </p>
<p>Dinah struggled forward again as vertigo swept over her in waves and tears fell down her cheeks mingling with her blood. She grabbed the shoulders of Helena 's leather duster with both hands, feeling the extreme tension in the brunette's shoulders, and kept pulling even as Helena continued to try and shrug her off. Over Helena's shoulder, Dinah could see that the man was in serious trouble. He wasn't moving, but appeared to be breathing by the way the blood bubbled in and out of his nose in a steady pattern.</p>
<p>"Helena," Dinah screamed through the tears, tugging one last effortful time. "You're going to kill him!"</p>
<p>One more powerful shrug from the brunette and Dinah found herself on her ass, hands instinctively bracing her fall. Helena had stopped and was sitting motionless on her knees. Her hands released the man quickly and she pushed away, much like she had just touched acid and her hands were burning. She tried to wipe them on her pants, but it was no use...her entire front side was covered in a thin coat of sticky red. Helena could even feel the substance sprayed across her face. She looked down at her hands, palms up, staring at the slick sheen of life covering every inch of flesh and suddenly felt like she was going to throw up. </p>
<p>Dinah reached out a tentative, shaking hand as she got to her feet and approached the brunette. She was genuinely terrified. Helena had turned into something in that small space of time that Dinah had never seen before. And it scared her. But she was determined not to let it get in the way of her helping the brunette. A second before Dinah's hand could reach the wet leather of Helena's jacket, the older girl turned fearful eyes to Dinah's, blue orbs glancing to the blonde's injured and swelling eye and then away again. Dinah didn't miss the horrified, painful look that crossed Helena's face before she had turned away. The brunette was staring at her hands again and shaking her head, disgusted at herself. </p>
<p>"Hel..." Dinah whispered, but was cut off by Helena's hand in the air telling her to stop.</p>
<p>Helena turned again, but kept her gaze averted. She reached into her pocket and pressed the car keys into Dinah's hand without looking her in the face...without looking at her at all.</p>
<p>"Go," she said softly but firmly and waited for the blonde to move before doing anything herself.</p>
<p>"What about..." the blonde's eyes flicked to the man's broken body.</p>
<p>"I'll drop him at the hospital and call Reese in the morning," Helena answered quickly, her senses somewhat returning to her....the reality of the situation making it hard for her to breathe. She turned her back to Dinah and waited.</p>
<p>"Helena..."</p>
<p>"Just go," Helena said loudly, the tensing of her jaw more than evident in the profile of her face that Dinah could see in the moonlight. Dinah felt the air shifting as Helena's eyes shifted from normal to feral and back again as she shook her head slightly. "Now," the brunette commanded as she crouched down and gathered the man in her arms. </p>
<p>When she turned around, Dinah was gone.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>*Clocktower*</p>
<p>The elevator door was hardly opened at all as Dinah stumbled past it into the lair, the only thing holding her up the adrenaline and fear that still engulfed her body. She was thankful she had made it all the way back to the Clocktower without passing out or hitting something. She knew she should have gone to the hospital, but she needed to tell Barbara what had happened. Maybe the two of them together could make sense of it.</p>
<p>"Where the hell have you been? I'm starv..." Barbara started as she wheeled toward the blonde, but stopped talking when she took in Dinah's battered and worn appearance. "What happened?" she asked, her heart immediately dropping as she placed her hands on either side of Dinah's face gingerly and examined her injuries.</p>
<p>Dinah shook her head, tears falling, and struggled to steady herself as her knees threatened to give out at any second. Confusion and worry coursed through Barbara as she steadied the blonde with strong hands and led her over to the couch where she could sit down. Dinah feverishly wiped at her face, Barbara's hands on her knees, and winced as she came close to the eye that was purple and swelled half shut.</p>
<p>"Dinah, where's Helena ?" Barbara asked as calmly as she could, tilting the blonde's face to look at her.</p>
<p>"She's at the hospital," Dinah answered, swallowing hard.</p>
<p>"What?" the redhead felt her heart leap into her throat, remembering the night seven years earlier that she and Helena had both found themselves in that hospital.</p>
<p>"She's not hurt...physically, anyway," Dinah quickly answered when she sensed Barbara starting to panic. "See there was this guy...and I only turned around for a second and then...I didn't know where she was and I couldn't get him off of me," the blonde felt hot tears flooded from her eyes. "And then there was so much blood and she wouldn't listen to me..."</p>
<p>"Whose blood, Dinah?" Barbara asked, reaching over to grab the cordless phone.</p>
<p>"His," the blonde replied. "She wouldn't stop. She just kept hitting him, Barbara...it was like something took over completely and she just wasn't there anymore. She was someone else...someone I've never seen before. It scared me."</p>
<p>Barbara felt her chest getting tight as she dialed the phone with one hand and reached up with the other to prod at Dinah's head wound. The blonde winced as Barbara wiped some of the blood away to get a good look at the cut. It must have been deep, Dinah surmised by the lightheaded feeling she was starting to get and the pained look on Barbara's face as she spoke into the receiver.</p>
<p>"Alfred, I'm sorry to bother you," the redhead was saying. "But I need you to come over and bring Bruce's old first aid kit." She paused for a second, listening. "Yeah, the big one," she nodded and clicked off the phone. "He'll be here in a few minutes," she told Dinah.</p>
<p>"Now tell me everything that happened," Barbara instructed gently. "And go slow. I'm right here and nothing else is going to happen to you," she squeezed the blonde's hand for emphasis. Dinah took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"There was a mugger. We split up and went after him," the blonde answered slowly, still trying to get her head to stop spinning. "I turned to look for Helena and then he was on my back. I hit the ground hard," her voice wavered for a second. "He uh...I think there was something sharp in my side and then he was gone."</p>
<p>"Helena," Barbara nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she just threw him down and started pounding on him. Slamming his head into the ground and talking to herself," Dinah said, holding onto Barbara's hand tightly. "I tried to stop her...grab her...but she was too strong. And then this," she motioned to her eye.</p>
<p>"<i>She</i> did this to you?" Barbara's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"No," Dinah immediately protested, and then paused. "I mean not really. When she hit me it was already cut pretty badly."</p>
<p>"I'm sure she didn't mean it," the redhead shook her head, still slightly confused and more than worried about Helena's behavior. Violence was something the brunette had been prone to since she was a teenager, but never quite like this. It was more than a little frightening to think where this would lead.</p>
<p>"She didn't," Dinah agreed firmly. "It wasn't her, Barbara. I could just tell it wasn't her. When I told her she was going to kill him, she stopped. And then she gave me the keys and told me to go. She wouldn't even look at me."</p>
<p>"Did she say where she was going after the hospital?" the redhead asked.</p>
<p>"Uh uh," Dinah shook her head, eyes lulling closed as her head fell back against the couch cushion.</p>
<p>"Dinah," Barbara shook the girl and her eyes fluttered open drowsily. "Dinah, you need to stay awake. It's very important that you keep your eyes open," she instructed the blonde. Dinah nodded and blinked a few times. Barbara struggled to keep the girl awake and cursed under her breath.</p>
<p>"Dammit, Alfred," she muttered. "Where are you?"</p>
<p>*close to two hours later*</p>
<p>"You know, normal people get anesthetic and painkillers," Dinah grumbled in pain as Alfred finished the last of her stitches and placed a thick bandage over her left eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Dare I say you're not the poster child for normality, Miss Dinah?" the butler smiled at her sweetly as she closed up his kit.</p>
<p>"Gee, what gave me away? The mind warping telekinesis or fact that on Friday night when all the other kids are at the movies, I'm suffering from a brain smooshing head injury?" the blonde asked with a small smile cut short by the pain shooting into her face as her lips turned up.</p>
<p>"With a smart remark like that, I'd say your brain is just fine," Alfred answered, still smiling. "Regardless of the <i>smooshing</i>."</p>
<p>The butler made his way over to the kitchen to deposit the blood soaked rags into the trash and clean his hands. He motioned to Barbara that he would be on the lower level if she needed him again as the redhead moved away from the computer and towards Dinah.</p>
<p>"Still no luck?" the blonde asked with a sad look on her face.</p>
<p>"She's still not online," Barbara answered. "But hospital records show that a man matching your description was dropped off in the emergency room a few hours ago. He's been moved to the ICU, but seems to be stable," she stopped in front of Dinah as her eyes drifted over the discolored and puffy half of the blonde's face and admired Alfred's work. Dinah looked much better than earlier. "So, how's the head?"</p>
<p>"I'll live," Dinah answered and tried to shrug, but it hurt too much. In fact, everything hurt too much. Breathing was starting to be painful. She was about to say something about going to bed when Barbara's eyes suddenly shifted to the darkness behind her and she could feel the redhead's senses in heightened alert.</p>
<p>After feeling the air in the room shift slightly, Barbara heard small almost invisible footsteps on the spiral staircase. When the bathroom door shut too quietly she was sure Helena had been watching them. But she wasn't sure for how long. Barbara told Dinah to lie down for a while and took the lift to the second floor.</p>
<p>The bathroom door wasn't closed all the way, a small crack of light screaming across the carpeted hallway in front of the redhead as she approached the sound of running water. Barbara opened the door slowly, light flooding over her as she glided into the small room and took in Helena's ragged appearance.</p>
<p>Helena was still completely dressed in black leather, from coat to pants to boots. Her face was flushed red...maybe from the cold of running across hundreds of rooftops at full speed for two hours, Barbara thought to herself. But what cut to Barbara's core and made it hard for the redhead to draw a breath was the way Helena was scrubbing at her hands feverishly in the sink. There were small streams of red flowing from her hands, but it wasn't someone else's blood. It was hers. Helena had been scraping so hard she was leaving tiny red gashes all over her fingers and palms. And her knuckles were purple and swollen.</p>
<p>"Helena," Barbara moved toward her slowly, one hand held out.</p>
<p>"I, uh..." the brunette tried speaking but it came out hoarse and scratchy. "I just can't," she shook her hands trying to emphasize the point she was failing miserably to make. "They're still so dirty," she managed in voice so small Barbara hardly recognized it.</p>
<p>"Helena, you're crying," Barbara said, noticing the wetness on the brunette's cheeks and hardly believing it herself. </p>
<p>"No, I'm not," Helena insisted, wiping at her eyes with the backs of her hands, not looking at the redhead.</p>
<p>"Yes you are," Barbara grabbed her forearm and held it in place.</p>
<p>"No," Helena demanded and pulled away roughly, taking a step back and turning to face Barbara. She still had bloodstains on her exposed stomach and upper chest.</p>
<p>"Helena, you need to talk about this," Barbara said gently.</p>
<p>"Is she okay?" Helena looked past Barbara to the open door.</p>
<p>"A little shaken up, but yeah," the redhead nodded. "Are <i>you</i> okay?"</p>
<p>"I need to go," the brunette ignored her question and took a step towards the door only to stop short when Barbara moved into her way. "Move," Helena instructed as she gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>"No," Barbara held her ground and shook her head. "I'm not letting you go."</p>
<p>"Dammit, Barbara," Helena said in a dangerous tone as she slammed both hands onto the arms of the redhead's chair and brought their faces close. Up close, Barbara realized that when Helena 's eyes shifted it was as frightening as it was beautiful. "Get the fuck out of my way."</p>
<p>"No," Barbara shook her head again and found it getting hard to breathe, Helena's power hanging in the air around them. The redhead felt tears stinging her eyes as she stared into Helena's and could almost see the brunette's insides crumbling as she fought with herself.</p>
<p>"Fuck," Helena pushed herself away and ran a ragged hand through chaotic hair. </p>
<p>She looked at Barbara and then to herself in the mirror and closed her eyes only opening them when she was sure they were back to normal. As Barbara watched, Helena gripped the sink with both hands so tightly her knuckles were turning white and then took a quick step back. The brunette clenched her fists at her sides and kicked hard and high, her foot connecting with the mirror and sending shards flying in all directions. Barbara raised her hands up to protect herself, shocked and bordering on desperate. Helena grabbed the metal trash bucket from the floor and used it to break out the window near the shower as fast as she could. Dropping the bucket onto the floor and not looking back, Helena disappeared out the window and into the harsh night leaving Barbara looking after her, head falling into her hands.</p>
<p>"Why'd she even come here?" Dinah asked from the doorway.</p>
<p>"This is her home. Somewhere inside she always knows that...counts on it," Barbara answered and sighed. "And to make sure you were okay," she turned to face Dinah and offered a weak smile.</p>
<p>"Why won't she let us help her?" the blonde leaned against the doorframe when she started feeling tired again.</p>
<p>"I don't know," Barbara shook her head. "I thought we were at a place where she wouldn't pull away again, but I guess I was wrong. I don't know, Dinah. I just don't know anymore," she shook her head again.</p>
<p>"I'm going to bed," Dinah said after a minute of silence.</p>
<p>"Take some aspirin," Barbara reached into the glass in the sink and pulled out the ibuprofen bottle to hand to the blonde.</p>
<p>"Night," Dinah said and wandered down the hallway.</p>
<p>"Night," Barbara called after her, more than relieved when Alfred appeared in the doorway with a broom and dustpan.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>*One week later, Dark Horse Bar*</p>
<p>Getting past the bouncer was no problem. He'd recognized Dinah from all the times she and Barbara had come in to see Helena. The crowd was still light, but Friday night was still young at ten o'clock and the blonde knew that in a few hours the place would be packed. Dinah headed straight for the bar, a disappointed look crossing her face as she realized that Helena wasn't there. There was a young man behind the counter with red hair. Dinah tried to remember his name. It was Mark or Matt or something like that. He had introduced himself to her once, but Dinah was too busy watching Helena serve and stand and breathe to actually hear anything he was saying. She realized over the past months that she was having butterflies-in-the-stomach feelings for Helena; stealing glances here and there when she thought the brunette wouldn't notice...hoping the brunette didn't notice. Actually she was way past that point. Dinah was pretty sure she was in love with Helena . Or at least in lust with her. The brunette made eating Pop-Tarts look sexy.</p>
<p>But she was still a little scared. Helena hadn't been back to the Clocktower since that night in the alley and no one had heard from her at all. Dinah had seen Helena in fights where she seemed to be somewhere else in her mind. She'd seen the brunette get out of hand, out of control, sometimes...but in the back of her head Dinah knew that she had no idea what Helena was really capable of and it made her nervous and uneasy that she was trying desperately to find the brunette but didn't know what kind of state she would be in once she got there. It was dangerous. Helena was dangerous.</p>
<p>Dinah took a deep breath and was about to ask the bartender a question when he turned to her and motioned to the stairs behind the bar. Dinah smiled a thank you and quickly made her way up the stairs to the second floor where the penthouse was located. When she got to the door, she paused and took another deep breath. She knocked and waited. There was no answer. She knocked again and waited. Still no answer. With a slightly shaky hand, Dinah tried the door knob. More than little surprised, she smiled to herself when the knob turned and the door opened. Of all the people in the city to keep their door unlocked, Helena was the one person who knew better.</p>
<p>Stepping into the apartment quietly, Dinah slowly closed the door and turned around to be met with complete darkness. Having only been there once before, the blonde took small steps around the room trying to keep bumping into things down to a minimum. She managed to find the light switch by the couch and flip it on, barely able to stifle a gasp as she looked around the living room and kitchen area. The place was a mess, tables overturned, lamps broken and lying across the floor in pieces. Dinah was starting to get a very bad feeling, her heart beating its way into her throat.</p>
<p>She stumbled down the small hallway, bumping into a few walls on her way but managing to maintain her balance. Helena's bedroom was just as dark, but there was a small glimmering of moonlight flooding from the window on the far wall opposite the doorway. Dinah used the light to guide her to the bedside table, her hand feeling for the small lamp, fingertips trailing along the base until she found the switch.</p>
<p>"Don't," a voice came from the shadows. </p>
<p>Dinah jumped and froze in place, her breathing becoming erratic. But as she began to calm down, it occurred to her that she recognized the voice and she squinted in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Helena, what are you...?"</p>
<p>"Just don't turn on the light," she answered, voice coming from the same dark corner.</p>
<p>"Where are you?" Dinah asked, able to follow the brunette's voice but still not able to pinpoint where she was. Dinah thought Helena must have been in the corner of the room on the other side of the bed, but there was another table over there between the bed and the wall and she was sure Helena couldn't fit.</p>
<p>"Here," Helena answered, reaching forward to hold a hand up in front of the window so that Dinah could see it in the moonlight. </p>
<p>Dinah's suspicions were correct. Helena had somehow managed to jam herself in between the edge of the table and the wall and seemed to be sitting down. Dinah wanted to move, but when she tried her legs felt like bags of sand.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she asked, fingers still resting on the edge of the lamp.</p>
<p>"I think they call it brooding. Barbara says I'm pretty good at it," Helena answered sarcastically, the hint of a small smile apparent in her voice for a second before she went solemn. "I didn't mean to...I'm sorry about..." she tried and paused for a second. "I'd never hurt you."</p>
<p>"I know that," Dinah nodded in the dark, hands playing with the tails of her shirt nervously.</p>
<p>"Do you?" Helena 's voice came out a bit harsher that she had expected and Dinah had anticipated. "Is that why you're standing over there like your feet are cemented to the floor? Like if you come any closer I might go all primal on you or something?"</p>
<p>Before Dinah could move or speak, Helena started again. "On second thought that's probably a good idea...to keep your distance. I'm a danger to myself and others apparently. At least that's what Barbara used to say when I was out of control, which I obviously am now. She send you?"</p>
<p>"No," Dinah answered, swallowing hard and taking a step forward finally. "She thinks I'm at the movies with Gabby. But she is worried about you. She's been calling..."</p>
<p>"I know," Helena interrupted her, voice muffled like she was covering her face.</p>
<p>"And I'm not afraid of you," Dinah moved around the bed quickly and slid onto the cool wood of the window seat, shifting until she was sitting cross legged and looking out the window at the gleaming lights of New Gotham at night.</p>
<p>"You should be," Helena said, picking up her head words catching in her throat as Dinah turned to look at her.</p>
<p>The cut above Dinah's eye had healed almost all the way. The stitches seemed to be gone and the swelling was down. But there was still the yellow and faint blue discoloring of a bruise that refused to go away. Helena sat still, staring at it, knowing that part of it was caused by her own hand. She felt the urge to clench her fists and pound them into herself for hurting Dinah like that, but calmed when she saw the blonde's expression soften in front of her. </p>
<p>Helena felt something inside of her light up when Dinah looked at her like that, like the flipping of a switch that somehow made her a better person...a happier person. She knew the real reason she had fought so hard against letting Dinah stay with them. She didn't want to care about anyone else or have to worry about anyone else. She didn't want to love. But from the second she encountered Dinah in that alleyway, Helena knew she started to change...day by day and bit by bit. When she got the sense Dinah was looking at her, she realized one day that she *wanted* Dinah to look at her like that...with desire and longing and curiosity. She found herself falling for Dinah's cheeky grins and overenthusiastic admiration for the calling. She started to notice the little things, the smell of the shampoo the blonde used and the way that she always sniffed the milk carton before pouring a glass. Dinah was under her skin and Helena knew it. She had let it go too far and like everything else that was close to her, Helena had almost destroyed it...she had almost destroyed herself because she loved Dinah so much. All she could remember was seeing Dinah and the knife and after that it was all a blur.</p>
<p>Dinah looked at Helena huddled in the corner of the room, pressed up against the wall. Her knees were drawn up to her chest, her arms loosely hugging them. Dinah could see even in the dim light that Helena was pale, eyes dark and hollow. She looked so small and fragile sitting there...completely harmless. Such a contradiction to the confident, sometimes arrogant, and always bold Huntress that Dinah was used to seeing. She looked like a scared child, hiding in the dark from the monsters...only Dinah knew that in Helena's mind the only monster she was trying to hide from was herself.</p>
<p>"What happened out there?" Dinah motioned to the living room with a tilt of her head, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>"I think you know the answer to that question," Helena answered and averted her eyes.</p>
<p>"Why?" Dinah leaned back against window jamb.</p>
<p>"It's dark in here sometimes...most of the time," Helena answered, spreading a hand across her chest and flicking her gaze back to the blonde. "It hurts," she said quietly. "When I break things...let go...the pain is...less."</p>
<p>"You need a better outlet for your aggression," Dinah offered a half smile.</p>
<p>"There's only one other thing I can think of," Helena replied with a suggestive grin, slipping in to guarded sarcasm with ease, "and it's rather aggressive itself actually. You probably wouldn't be into it."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be so sure," the blonde answered, still smiling. "However, I was actually referring to *talking* about things more often," she added in a more serious tone. "It might help."</p>
<p>"I have a therapist," Helena said, smile fading.</p>
<p>"Something tells me you aren't completely open with her, either."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well that's what being guarded and emotionally scarred will do to a person," Helena answered flippantly. </p>
<p>"You shouldn't be in here punishing yourself for what happened," the blonde spoke gently. </p>
<p>"Dinah..." Helena shifted forward a little.</p>
<p>"No," the blonde said louder and shook her head a little. "You were just trying to protect me. He was going to hurt me. And you shouldn't be feeling bad and beating yourself up over something you had no control over. I saw you, Helena...you were different..."</p>
<p>"Don't you get it, Dinah?" Helena interrupted the blonde, dropping one knee and leaning on the other. "I'm not sitting her punishing myself for feeling bad about what I did. I'm sitting here because I *don't* feel bad. I nearly killed a man and there's a huge part of me that doesn't even give a fuck. There's a part of me that feels almost satisfied."</p>
<p>"You can't mean that," Dinah said in a small voice, brows furrowing.</p>
<p>"Why? Because it scares you?" Helena asked incredulously. "Well it fucking scares me too. I'm standing on the edge, Dinah. I've got my fucking feet dangling over it and I'm more than ready and willing just to fucking let go and jump. I don't give a fuck if I crash and burn or make it through anymore. All I know is that for seven years I've been teetering back and forth, never knowing where or if I fit anywhere, and I'm getting tired of trying to hold myself back. I've been living in my father's image for so long that I'm starting to forget why I do any of this in the first place...and every time I do something that might make him proud, wherever the fuck he is, I feel like I'm betraying my mother's memory by denying the side of me that <i>is</i> her."</p>
<p>"I think your mother would be more proud of what you are now, what you've become in spite of all that's happened to you," Dinah shook her head and held Helena's eyes. "You're helping people, doing something meaningful. And I don't care what you say. She wasn't able to fight her darkness, but you are. There's more good in you, more light than darkness. I've seen it, Helena...even that night. You could have killed him, but you didn't. You stopped."</p>
<p>"I don't expect you to understand," Helena ran a hand through her hair and looked away.</p>
<p>"So make me understand," Dinah countered, uncrossing her legs to drop a foot the floor and slide forward.</p>
<p>"You know I thought with Canary's death and all, you'd have some clue how it feels to have your insides torn apart...you'd know that sometimes things happen that change you and no matter how hard you try you can never really be the same," Helena narrowed her eyes, anger creeping. "But obviously I was wrong because you're doing a brilliant job of acting like you don't care at all."</p>
<p>"Sometimes you can be a real ass," Dinah choked back tears as she got up and moved away from the window towards the door.</p>
<p>"Dinah, wait," Helena immediately kicked herself in the ass for <i>being</i> such an ass and got up quickly, grabbing Dinah by the wrist to stop her.</p>
<p>"You know, your mother might be dead but at least you knew her while she was still here," the blonde said, head bowed, without turning. "And maybe I act like I don't care because I don't want you to think I'm a weak little girl that can't handle her emotions."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Helena offered gently, rubbing her thumb over the back of Dinah's wrist for emphasis. Dinah turned to look at her, eyes wet and glistening in the moonlight. Helena thought it was the most heartbreakingly beautiful thing she'd ever seen. "Why did you come here?" she asked quietly, staring into the blonde's eyes.</p>
<p>"I was worried about you," Dinah shrugged and bit her lip to keep it from trembling. "If I hadn't been so careless...if I hadn't turned my back...you wouldn't have..."</p>
<p>"Stop," Helena slid her hands into Dinah's and squeezed. "None of this was your fault. Do you hear me? None of it," she said firmly. "Especially this," she added in a softer tone, raising a tentative hand to trail fingertips lightly over the fresh scar above Dinah's eye.</p>
<p>"What's holding you back?" Dinah asked, barely able to speak as she felt Helena's hand on her face, her body so near.</p>
<p>"What?" Helena asked confused, her thumb brushing over Dinah's wound somehow making it even more real because she was physically touching it.</p>
<p>"You said you were on the edge and ready to jump," the blonde said, leaning into Helena's touch. "So what's holding you back? Barbara's obviously losing her grip."</p>
<p>"You," Helena found herself saying before it even registered that she was talking. "What I did to you," she added a second later. "I don't ever want to hurt anyone I..." she paused, knowing what she wanted to say, but also knowing she couldn't say it. "I just don't want to hurt anyone again."</p>
<p>"Funny, right now I can't feel a thing," Dinah said with a nervous smile as she reached up to cover Helena's hand with her own, watching as the brunette's eyes clouded over with barely hidden emotion.</p>
<p>Helena bit her lip as the gears in her head started turning, forcing her to close the distance between them even further. She paused, her face close to Dinah's as she grabbed the blonde around the waist with her free hand and moved the other slightly until her fingertips slid into soft, golden hair. Using both hands, Helena pulled Dinah the remaining space to her, eyes closing, lips touching Dinah's delicately at first, unsure. Dinah's hands found their way around Helena's neck, pulling her in tightly, lips opening as the brunette's tongue slid out slowly and waited for permission to take the kiss further. The blonde fell into the kiss as it deepened, her tongue dancing along side Helena's, hands holding the brunette closer as Dinah felt her knees threatening to buckle.</p>
<p>After a few endless moments Helena pulled back, mouth still slightly open, lips wet and swollen. She struggled to keep herself under control as her heartbeat picked up and she looked into Dinah's eyes that were heavy with desire. Her want for the girl was quickly consuming her. She knew she would keep taking until nothing was left...it was her curse. When Dinah's hands slid down to rest over her heart, Helena backed away quickly and averted her eyes.</p>
<p>"Shit, you should go," she said, running a hand through her hair and not looking at the blonde. "You have school in the morning."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow's Saturday," Dinah replied, still a little dazed.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow's what?" Helena turned her eyes to the younger girl, genuinely confused.</p>
<p>"How long have you been here like this?" the blonde asked, taking cautious steps towards Helena.</p>
<p>"I...don't know," the brunette answered, furrowing her brow in thought. "Must've lost track of time," she shrugged and eyed Dinah. "Still, you should go."</p>
<p>"I'm staying," Dinah shook her head in response; Helena could sense it without even looking.</p>
<p>"Dinah, you can't," Helena said firmly. "Barbara will kick your ass."</p>
<p>"I'll call her."</p>
<p>"Dinah," Helena stepped away and shook her head. "It's not a good idea with what just...I don't deserve..."</p>
<p>"Don't finish that thought," the blonde interrupted and boldly took Helena's hand into her own.</p>
<p>She pulled the brunette to her, arms wrapping around strong shoulders as she pulled Helena into a tight, warm embrace. After a short, stiff protest at first, Helena folded into the hug, arms sliding tightly around Dinah's waist as she buried her face into sweet smelling hair. Helena felt her body going almost limp, tension momentarily fading as she held onto how good it felt just to be comforted. They stayed that way for a long while, Dinah's refusal to leave tugging at a part of Helena she thought she'd lost a long time ago. Dinah had seen a part of Helena that she never wanted anyone to see and somehow the blonde was still right there by her side.</p>
<p>"You need to sleep," Dinah whispered close to Helena's ear.</p>
<p>"I can't. When I close my eyes..." Helena shook her head and took a deep breath. "I just can't."</p>
<p>Helena could hear Dinah's heartbeat pounding in her ear like a jackhammer that was way out of control. She could smell the blonde's desire; feel the heat between them escalating. Dinah leaned into her more as Helena 's lips dragged across the side of her neck, collarbone, and further up until their lips were tangled once again. The kiss was harder, deeper than the first, need and hunger overtaking consideration and gentleness. A low growl escaped from the back of Helena's throat as she grabbed Dinah's bottom lip between her teeth and pulled back before letting go. The blonde's eyes fluttered open as she struggled to catch her breath, and had to fight to keep from stepping back as she kept her gaze level on Helena 's flushed face.</p>
<p>"Your eyes..." Dinah said in a husky voice, staring at the darker blue they had just turned.</p>
<p>Helena turned and stepped away, closing her eyes and concentrating until she felt herself shifting back again.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she muttered and gritted her teeth, suddenly feeling trapped and wanting nothing more than to make a quick exit. </p>
<p>"Stop saying that," Dinah protested and circled Helena until she was standing in front of her again. "I'm not sorry about anything. What happened just now or earlier. You never have to be sorry for being who you are."</p>
<p>"When I'm like that, I could hurt you. Don't you understand that?" Helena raised her voice, frustrated.</p>
<p>"Yes," Dinah managed through the lump developing in her throat. "But I know you wouldn't. I trust you."</p>
<p>"Don't say that," Helena demanded, grabbing Dinah's forearms roughly.</p>
<p>"Why not?" the blonde blinked back tears. "It's the truth. I trust you and I love you," she added boldly, noting the release of Helena's grip and the softening of her features at the mention of the last three words. "Every part of you, no matter what."</p>
<p>"Why?" Helena asked, voice threatening to crack. "I'm..."</p>
<p>"You're smart and strong and brave," Dinah interrupted her and spoke evenly, twisting her arms to hold the underside of Helena's forearms softly. "Not to mention incredibly sexy," she added with a small smile. "And just because you made a mistake it doesn't mean you'll keep doing it...and it doesn't change the way I feel about you."</p>
<p>"If you'd just trust yourself, Hel," she continued when the brunette averted her eyes. "You'd believe what I already know...that you're still in control and you won't ever let that happen again. You won't ever kill."</p>
<p>"Where'd you learn to be so brave yourself?" Helena turned her eyes back to Dinah's, a small smile creeping.</p>
<p>"I have two amazing friends that never let me forget that I'm capable of being anything that I choose," she answered, relaxing when Helena began to smile. "And they're always there to help me make the right choice. We're here to help you Helena, if you'd just accept it."</p>
<p>"Call Barbara," the brunette smiled and reached past Dinah to turn on the lamp. "I'm gonna go clean up the living room," she said and exited the bedroom.</p>
<p>Dinah reached into her pants pocket and pulled out her earpiece, carefully placing it in and holding the cuff of her sweatshirt up towards her mouth as she spoke.</p>
<p>"You get all that?" she said quietly.</p>
<p>'Copy that, Dinah,' Barbara's voice echoed in her ear. 'All of it. Although I don't remember telling you to kiss her.'</p>
<p>Dinah felt herself blushing. "Yeah that was all me," she said with a smile. "She's better, Barbara. I mean, there's still a lot to get through I think. I was in her head for a second and it's dark in there...there's a lot of unresolved pain...and fear. But she's better."</p>
<p>'At least she's starting to deal with it,' Barbara said. 'You did really great, Dinah. I'm proud of you for being so honest and open. I think that's what really made the difference.'</p>
<p>"I meant everything I said," the blonde admitted, listening for Helena and hearing what sounded like the table being turned back over. "Everything I did."</p>
<p>'I know. We're going to have a talk about that later,' the redhead nodded to herself on the other side of the feed. 'Try and get her to sleep. I'll see you back here in the morning.' She paused and then added in a playful tone, 'and behave.'</p>
<p>"Check," Dinah smiled and was about to remove the earpiece when Barbara spoke again.</p>
<p>'And Dinah, thank you,' she said quickly and cut the line.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Helena awoke with a start, legs tangled in the sheets, hair matted to her face with sweat, and completely out of breath. She was soaked from head to toe, tanktop clinging to her back and midsection. The room was dark, and she was startled when a hand fell onto her shoulder and she pulled away from it slightly.</p>
<p>"Hey," Dinah said softly, shifting so that she was sitting up next to Helena and used her free hand to brush the damp hair off of the brunette's forehead. "You're burning up," she said concern clouding her eyes as her hand rested on the scorching flesh of Helena's cheek.</p>
<p>"I was uh...dreaming, I think," Helena answered quietly, running a hand through her hair and down the back of her neck, resting it there as she took deep breaths. </p>
<p>Dinah was running her hand over Helena's back, trying to calm her down. She had never seen Helena so vulnerable. It was a truth the brunette was good at hiding.</p>
<p>"You were...uh...you were," Helena started, but fell short, reaching over to place a hand on the blonde's knee.</p>
<p>"I was what?" Dinah asked, her hand stilling on Helena's lower back, creeping underneath the tanktop to caress the soft skin there.</p>
<p>"I got there too late," the brunette stared down at the tangled mess of sheets. "I couldn't save you."</p>
<p>"But you did," Dinah insisted, using both hands to guide Helena's face to look at her cradling it gently. "I'm right here," she held Helena's eyes in the dark. "I'm safe."</p>
<p>Helena swallowed hard and leaned forward seizing Dinah's lips and crawling on top of her as they fell back onto the mattress. She kissed the blonde desperately, relentlessly; trying to prove to herself that she was actually there...that her dream was just that. Dinah's hands tangled in her hair, holding her close until Helena pulled back and slid down her body, curling around it, without a word. The brunette rested her head against Dinah's stomach, arms wrapped tightly around her waist. She stayed that way, with Dinah's hand threading through her hair and her eyes wide open, until morning came.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Harder and faster," Helena commanded and it made Dinah smile. But the brunette wasn't playing around.</p>
<p>Dinah rushed forward, arms swinging quickly in a heavy blur, and Helena blocked every single punch without breaking a sweat. The blonde bit down hard, flexing her jaw and barreled forward again breezing past Helena as she ducked to the side and grabbed Dinah from behind in a tight bear hug, pinning the blonde's arms down to the sides of her body. Dinah was breathing hard, flexing her arms in struggle as Helena tightened her hold.</p>
<p>"Keep your mind on the fight and your emotions in check," she hissed, close to Dinah's ear. "Or you'll find yourself in a very dangerous position before you even know what hit you."</p>
<p>Helena released Dinah and pushed her forward, falling back into a fighting stance as the blonde turned around and nodded taking a deep breath. Helena held Dinah's eyes in a silent explanation that she was only being hard on the girl because she cared about her and needed her to be prepared for anything when it came to fighting. Dinah nodded again when she saw Helena's body language loosen for a moment and then go stiff again.</p>
<p>Dinah came forward again slow at first and then faster as her momentum built. Again, Helena held her off although it was slightly harder this time. The younger girl was concentrating on the fight, her movements, and the movements of her opponent. Helena wanted to smile at the progress Dinah was making, but held it in as they sparred as equals. </p>
<p>Punching at Helena's chest, the brunette caught Dinah's fist tightly in her hand and began to twist. Instead of panicking, Dinah used the momentum of Helena's action and spun around and down, twisting at the waist. Without losing a second or her balance, Dinah pulled her hand free and, crouching down, used her right leg to sweep Helena 's legs out from under her, depositing the brunette onto the floor flat on her back.</p>
<p>Dinah smiled momentarily until she noticed that Helena wasn't moving. She quickly crawled over to the brunette and straddled her waist, using delicate hands to turn Helena's face to hers. Her eyes were shut, but her breathing seemed to be normal. Dinah was considering freaking out and calling for Barbara when Helena's eyes flew open and a small smile crossed her lips. The blonde had less than a second to process this as Helena grabbed her by collar of her sweatshirt and brought her knees up, throwing Dinah over her head and rolling back until she had successfully reversed their positions.</p>
<p>Helena took in Dinah's startled yet trusting eyes as she straddled the blonde's waist with her knees and held her hands against the floor, fingers laced between Dinah's. Dinah smiled as Helena descended on her lips and kissed her slowly and sweetly.</p>
<p>"So much for keeping your mind on the fight," the blonde commented as Helena pulled back, but hovered above her face smiling widely.</p>
<p>"I'm easily distracted by how hot you look frustrated and sprawled out beneath me," Helena answered smartly, leaning down to kiss Dinah again this time harder and longer.</p>
<p>"There's something even more distracting I could show you," the blonde teased as Helena moved her assault to the soft skin of Dinah's throat.</p>
<p>Helena's head shot up suddenly, eyes focused on the door to the training room. "Barbara," she said.</p>
<p>"Not exactly what I was going for..." Dinah started, confused.</p>
<p>"Barbara's on her way in," Helena shook her head and swiftly rolled off of Dinah and onto her feet as the door creaked open and the redhead appeared, moving towards them.</p>
<p>"Sorry to interrupt," Barbara threw a half smile and knowing glance at the girls, her eyes quickly coming back to Helena who was still looking ragged and worn. It was the first time she had seen Helena since the night in the bathroom and Barbara felt her chest become heavy at the sight.</p>
<p>"It's cool," Helena quickly dropped her gaze and bit her lip. "You wanna do the batarang training with Barbara?" she directed at Dinah who was finally getting to her feet.</p>
<p>"Actually, I just remembered that my room is a total disaster area and I should go clean it...or run outside and play in traffic..." Dinah babbled an answer, shifting her eyes from Helena to Barbara and heading for the door quickly, the redhead touching her arm affectionately as she passed by.</p>
<p>Helena and Barbara were still and silent for a long moment, neither knowing where to begin. Helena was staring at the floor listening to her heart doing its best impression of a rabbit on crack. Barbara stared at Helena who was staring at the floor and took a deep breath, trying desperately for a way to break the ice that wasn't awkward or trite. Helena took care of that problem for her.</p>
<p>"Sorry about the mirror," the brunette said, eyes still averted.</p>
<p>"S'okay," Barbara waved her off. "It's replaceable," she said and approached the brunette. "You, however, are <i>not</i>."</p>
<p>"One of a kind, huh?" Helena finally turned her eyes to Barbara, tears threatening to sting them in remembrance of the scene in the bathroom and how close she was to hurting the redhead. "I'm so sorry, Barbara."</p>
<p>Barbara moved closer as she saw Helena falter and reached up to place a gentle hand on the brunette's cheek, forcing her to keep her head up.</p>
<p>"Listen, I know you struggle everyday. And that there's a constant war of emotions and feelings inside of you, but deep down I know you know who you are," Barbara said gently, thumb brushing over Helena's cheek as she spoke. "We all lose control, but you are not alone in this."</p>
<p>"She was on the ground and all I saw was the knife, Barbara," Helena said, finally opening up to her about what happened. "And something inside of me just snapped. Suddenly I was back on that rainy street watching my mother die. That can't ever happen again. I'm never going to stand by helpless and do nothing while someone I love dies ever again," she stared Barbara in the eyes as a tear fell down her cheek and the redhead quickly wiped it away. "I don't even remember grabbing him...or hitting her...and suddenly I was there covered in blood and it scared the hell out of me."</p>
<p>"Because it didn't bother you as much as you thought it should," Barbara finished for her and smiled.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Helena answered, brow furrowing in confusion. "So why are you smiling?"</p>
<p>"Don't you see, Helena? You resisted. You stopped," she said, sliding her hand off of the brunette's face and into her hand, squeezing. "And you immediately resisted the feeling of satisfaction from your actions. The fact that it bothered you that it didn't bother you just proves further that the good in you is greater than anything else. So you might think that you don't care about what you did, but sitting in a room for a week punishing yourself tells otherwise."</p>
<p>"I stopped this time, Barbara," Helena shook her head. "But if I ever get my hands on the bastard that killed my mother, I can't promise you anything."</p>
<p>"I know," the redhead nodded in understanding. "But I also know that your mother raised you well...that she taught you the difference between right and wrong. That she's a big part of the strength and determination I've always admired in you. And even though your rage clouds your judgment, I think you'll find that when it comes down to it and you've got someone's life in your hands you'll remember her and make the right choice. I have faith in you, Helena. Even if you don't have it in yourself yet."</p>
<p>"I hope I don't disappoint you," Helena said quietly, her body overwhelmed with the sense of love that Barbara was enveloping her in. </p>
<p>"You could never disappoint me," Barbara shook her head adamantly. "Never."</p>
<p>Helena was squeezing Barbara's hand in gratitude for such love and understanding when the loud wailing of the Delphi Alert system interrupted their warm moment and sent them running to the computer center as fast as they could possibly get there.</p>
<p>Dinah was already there, hair wet from showering, and pressing all sorts of buttons she knew she shouldn't be touching. Barbara quickly nudged her out of the way and cut the alarm with one hand while she scrolled through the overhead monitor with the other. Dinah's face scrunched up in embarrassment as Helena came to a stop close to behind her, eyes on the screen and hands resting on the blonde's shoulders affectionately as she inhaled the sweet smell of her shampoo. Dinah leaned back into her touch, reveling in the feeling of security that she felt being so close to the brunette.</p>
<p>"We going out?" Helena asked as Barbara stopped on an incoming dispatch message from the New Gotham Police Department.</p>
<p>"Looks that way," the redhead nodded, reading. "There's robbery in progress at a small jewelry shop on the corner of Third and Main," she said and continued typing. "Two suspects, both armed. Cops are at least twenty minutes away."</p>
<p>"We better get going then," she squeezed Dinah's shoulders and grabbed her clothes to change in the elevator. "Come on, kid."</p>
<p>"Be careful. Take care of each other," Barbara called to the girls as the door started to close. "And remember what I said, Helena ," she added and held the brunette's eyes as the door clicked shut.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Dinah couldn't wipe the shit eating grin off of her face as Helena pulled the Hummer to a screeching stop about two blocks from the jewelry store. She kept going over every inch of the brunette's smooth skin from head to toe in her mind as she remembered the stripping display she had witnessed in the elevator as it quickly descended the Clocktower. Helena threw the car into park and cut the engine, tossing the keys to Dinah and looking at her with determination.</p>
<p>"Stay here," she said firmly.</p>
<p>"No way," the blonde immediately protested.</p>
<p>"Dinah..." Helena warned in a dangerous tone, eyes serious.</p>
<p>"I know what you're thinking and no," Dinah reaffirmed, throwing the keys back and reaching for the handle.</p>
<p>"For once will you just do what I fucking tell you," the brunette grabbed Dinah's arm and held her back from the door. </p>
<p>Dinah turned her eyes to Helena with a mixture of understanding and resentment in them that made the brunette let go almost immediately. They sat locked in a war of wills, neither one backing down, and neither one quite sure who would win. Dinah reached out a bold hand and ran the back of her hand down the side of Helena's face gently, barely grazing the skin as she shook her head back and forth. Helena grabbed Dinah's hand and held it in both of hers as she took a deep breath.</p>
<p>'Huntress, I need you over at that jewelry store five minutes ago,' Barbara's voice rang in her ear. Helena stared at Dinah, knowing she had heard it too.</p>
<p>"Stay close to me. Do exactly as I say. And if you feel like you're starting to lose, run back here as fast as you can and just drive," Helena instructed, dropping Dinah's hand only after the blonde had nodded in understanding and the keys were back in Dinah's possession.</p>
<p>"What about..." Dinah started as they exited the car together and took off down the street.</p>
<p>"I'll be fine," Helena dismissed her, ignoring the concerned puppy dog eyes Dinah seemed so fond of bestowing upon her lately, and ran full speed towards their target feeling the blonde hot on her heels.</p>
<p>Helena saw the two culprits exiting the store carrying a large black bag each and ripping their masks off as she and Dinah approached the building with silent steps. She grabbed Dinah by the jacket momentarily and pulled her along as the brunette took off down the street after the two retreating robbers.</p>
<p>'They're on the move, guys,' Barbara said into both their ears.</p>
<p>"We know," Helena struggled to say as she and Dinah kept on running. "We're right behind them, Oracle. Hold on just a sec," the brunette added as one of the men turned back and caught sight of the two women following them.</p>
<p>Helena and Dinah were closing in on the men when the one on the left suddenly turned down an alleyway, splitting away from his partner. Helena cursed and stopped in front of the alley so fast, Dinah slammed into her from behind. The blonde barely held her footing and made a split second decision to push Helena forward towards the guy that was still running down the street in front of them. As Helena's eyes narrowed, Dinah took off running down the alley towards the other guy. Helena looked after her for a long moment, struggling to decide what to do, and then took off down the brightly lit street.</p>
<p>"Dammit, Dinah," she said to herself, forgetting for a second that Barbara was still on the line.</p>
<p>'What's going on?' the redhead asked.</p>
<p>"They split up. I lost Dinah. She branched off down an alley near Seventh," Helena explained as she came a few yards from the man that was about to become her prey. "I'll be going after her in a second. This guy's just about done."</p>
<p>Helena grabbed the retreating robber by the back of his shoulder length hair and pulled him to a stop, bag flying to the ground and feet coming out from under him. He managed to grunt in pain for a second before Helena slammed him face first into the hard brick of the closest building. She let go, dropping him to the ground in an unconscious heap, mouth slightly open and bleeding. Helena felt someone's presence and looked across the street to her right to see a short man in his twenties standing there with his jaw hanging open.</p>
<p>"Hey, you got a cell phone?" she called to him, confident. He nodded, mouth still open in astonishment. "Call the police and tell them you just found one of the guy's that knocked over Conley's Jewelers. And keep the reward," she winked at him, noting his goofy smile. "You never saw me."</p>
<p>With that, Helena took off in the opposite direction pushing herself as hard as she could back towards the alley. The sound of a gunshot made her stop dead in her tracks, her heart climbing into her throat, her eyes shifting to narrow slits as the change hit her hard. </p>
<p>Seconds later she flew into the alley, relieved to see Dinah still standing. The blonde was engaged in combat, both arms bracing the robber's arm above their heads, the pistol still in his grasp. Helena felt the anger overtake her as she glided forward and then stopped when she found it hard to concentrate, hazy blackness threatening to take her over. Dinah continued to struggle, the man's free hand hitting her in the stomach so that she lost her grip on his arm and doubled over. He pushed her upright, back against the wall and was raising the pistol when the blonde cried out.</p>
<p>"Helena!" The fear in her eyes was staggering as Helena stood frozen, feet stuck in place just watching and unable to move.</p>
<p>'Helena, listen to my voice,' Barbara intervened when she figured out what was going on. She could tell the brunette was breathing differently, struggling. 'You can do this. You know you can do this. I know you're scared, but I'm right here with you. She needs you, Helena...Huntress. Dinah needs you.'</p>
<p>That was about all it took to snap Helena back to reality. Barbara was with her, she wouldn't let anything happen. Helena was sure of that, the line between them always connected and strong. The brunette surged forward, kicking the gun out of the robber's hand and grabbing him by the collar of his jacket. He soared through the air, back crashing against a nearby dumpster with a loud thud. Grimaced look on his face, he struggled to regain his footing, but Helena already had a boot shoved against his chest pushing him back down. He was scared. Helena could smell it and she liked it.</p>
<p>"You okay, kid?" she called over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Dinah answered, catching her breath and moving away from the wall and towards the brunette. "You?"</p>
<p>"I'll be great once I kick the ever loving shit out of this guy," Helena smiled and pressed down harder on her foot, pushing all of her weight against the man slumped against the dumpster. He cried out in pain, squirming.</p>
<p>'Huntress,' Barbara said in a warning voice causing Dinah to move faster. 'Get the weapon and the jewels and drop him at the station now.'</p>
<p>"But I haven't had my fun yet," she answered through clenched teeth as she leaned forward on the man again, moving her foot higher to his throat to cut off his oxygen supply.</p>
<p>And then she felt Dinah's hand sliding into the one that was dangling on the side of her body. In that small space of time, Helena felt her body calm and her eyes shift back to normal. With one touch from Dinah and Barbara's voice in her head Helena was back to reality, back to the moment, back to herself. The brunette let up the pressure and in one swift movement swung a hard kick to the man's face, his head lolling forward against his chest as he was knocked out cold. Helena dropped her foot back to the ground and squeezed Dinah's hand before releasing it and sliding her arm over the blonde's shoulders, kissing her temple sweetly.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she said quietly as she felt Dinah's arms snake around her waist tightly.</p>
<p>Barbara smiled lightly and breathed a sigh of relief on the other end of the line. They had made it through the night and were all in one piece. The battle was just starting, but she knew Helena had made it through what might prove to be the hardest part...the beginning.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Helena woke in a cold sweat for the second night in row. She found herself sitting up, her surroundings slightly unfamiliar. Pushing the wet hair off of her forehead she turned to see Dinah fast asleep curled up next to her. She then remembered bringing the blonde home and taking her to bed, not even a protest from Barbara, and falling asleep next to her only hours before. It was still night, Helena could tell from the way the moon hung high in the sky as she glanced out the window. The brunette looked down at Dinah so young and innocent lying there in a sound sleep and brushed the golden hair out of her face gently before slipping out of bed and into her pants and the first one of Dinah's sweatshirts that she could get her hands on.</p>
<p>The air was cool and somehow bitter as Helena stealthily slid through the door and onto the balcony of the Clocktower. She quickly hugged the sweatshirt around herself, smiling when she realized she was surrounded by Dinah's scent...almost feeling the girl's lips on her own, feeling her body carefully draped over the blonde's. Helena climbed onto the ledge, momentarily looking down to the empty streets below, and settled down letting her legs dangle off into the dark abyss.</p>
<p>"Do you always have to sit so close to the edge?" Barbara appeared behind her.</p>
<p>"You know I do," Helena smiled and swung her legs over until she was facing the redhead. "Nice pjs," she added with a grin, taking in Barbara's nightwear. "Silk looks good on you, Gordon."</p>
<p>"I think there's a certain blonde girl that wouldn't appreciate your flirtatious nature," Barbara answered with a small smile of her own as she moved closer to Helena .</p>
<p>"About that..."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to pry," Barbara held up a hand to stop her. "You're an adult. She's certainly not a child. But there are going to be some rules."</p>
<p>"The breakable kind?" Helena teased. "Because those are my favorite."</p>
<p>"You better bask in your surly sarcasm now because this whole you sleeping in her bed thing, it won't be happening again any time soon," Barbara warned only half joking.</p>
<p>"You're going to be a great Mom someday, Barbara," Helena said seriously, really looking at the redhead and realizing what an amazing person she was.</p>
<p>"And then you say something like that and all of my stern parenting skills go right out the window," the redhead replied, moving close to Helena and placing a hand on her knee as they both shifted to look out over the city.</p>
<p>"I feel like I've still got a long way to go," Helena said quietly, staring out at the lights.</p>
<p>"And I'll be here every step of the way," Barbara answered, glancing at the brunette and then forward again. "You're having nightmares again," she added after a few moments.</p>
<p>"They're not as bad as when...you know," Helena shifted her gaze to her hands that were lying motionless in her lap. "I never said thank you for all those nights..."</p>
<p>"You never have to," the redhead said quickly, reaching over to take Helena's hand. "You helped me too."</p>
<p>"So how come you and I never did the dirty?" Helena asked with a sarcastic smile. "With all those nights I crawled into bed with you. I mean, I know you find me dead sexy."</p>
<p>"I think the fact that you act like an infant sometimes probably played a part in it," Barbara smiled back and squeezed Helena's hand.</p>
<p>"Oh please, you love my immaturity. You think it's endearing."</p>
<p>"I also love it when I'm trying to have a serious conversation with you and right when it's going along nicely, you try and suck the meaning right out of it," the redhead pointed out, smiling when she felt Helena lean into her shoulder lightly.</p>
<p>"Yeah well me and mushy just aren't friends yet," Helena answered in her normal sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Give yourself a little more time with Dinah and I bet that'll change," Barbara winked at the brunette and pushed her back playfully.</p>
<p>"Speaking of," Helena said, shifting and hopping off of the ledge. "I should probably get back before she notices I'm gone and I give her more of an abandonment complex."</p>
<p>"Very thoughtful of you," Barbara joined her in the walk back inside.</p>
