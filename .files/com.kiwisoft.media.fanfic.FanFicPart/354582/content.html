<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 11 -->

<p>"Looks like we're here," Tara said to Willow as they reached her dorm room.
"T-thanks for walking me back," she added softly.</p>

<p>"It was no problem," Willow told her. "It was nice getting to know you Tara.
You should come to the Bronze with us all tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"The Bronze?" Tara asked as she unlocked her door.</p>

<p>"Yeah it's just a club where we all get together most nights. I could come
by and get you tomorrow if you wanted to come. You could meet my boyfriend
Oz, and the rest of the gang."</p>

<p>"Sure," Tara said with a smile. "D-do you wanna maybe c-come in for a
while?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Willow smiled at her and walked into the dorm room. Willow looked
around the shy blondes room. It was built just like her own was, only
decorated different. The first thing she noticed was a rather large
bookshelf and she went to look at the books. When Willow noticed they were
mostly spell books her eyes went wide. "Your a Wicca too?" Willow asked
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I-I'm nothing special but I like to practice a lot." Tara smiled at
her as she walked over to where Willow was standing.</p>

<p>"Did you know there's a Wicca club on campus? I was thinking about going to
the next meeting. You should come too," Willow said happily.</p>

<p>"Maybe I will then. Do you wanna try some spells while you're here?" Tara
asked.</p>

<p>Willow nodded enthusiastically and Tara pulled a book from the shelf. "How
long have you been practicing?"</p>

<p>"For a while now," Willow told her. "But I've never really tried anything
other than minor spells. Well except for once but that's a long story,"
Willow smiled sheepishly at her.</p>

<p>"Well then we can start with some easy spells and work our way up as time
passes," Tara said. Willow smiled at her and the two sat down on the floor,
already feeling close to one another.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning back at the Summer's residence, Buffy was the first to
wake. She tried getting Faith to get up as well, but the brunette refused to
move from her spot in the bed. "C'mon baby, please?" Buffy pouted at the
half awake brunette.</p>

<p>"No," Faith grumbled as she pulled the pillow down over her face, knowing it
would only be a matter of seconds of seeing Buffy's pouty face before she
caved.</p>

<p>Buffy was on to her though and pulled the pillow out of Faith's grasp. "I
know you can't refuse my pouty face," Buffy teased as she bent down to kiss
Faith's forehead.</p>

<p>"It's eight in the morning B, anything's possible," Faith responded before
rolling on her side so she wasn't facing her girlfriend. "Go bug Cordy and
Missy," Faith told her.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes lit up at the idea and she climbed out of her old bed. "Fine, I
will. You can stay here and be Miss Grouchy Pants," Buffy stuck her tongue
out at her girlfriend even though Faith couldn't see her.</p>

<p>Faith just chuckled softly and buried her head in the pillows. "I will," she
said softly as Buffy walked out of the room, leaving her to get more sleep.</p>

<p>The first place Buffy went was to the guest room to see if her two friends
were still asleep. When she saw that the door was open, and the bed was made
she figured that they never even made it up there last night. Missy wasn't
one to make her bed first thing in the morning, and she doubted that Cordy
was either.</p>

<p>She let out a soft yawn, almost considering going back to sleep with Faith
but now she wanted to see what the other two were up to. When she walked
into the room she let out a soft laugh upon seeing the two of them. They
were both laying on the couch, and Cordy was literally on top of Missy and
both were still asleep.  Buffy shook her head ruefully and headed back
upstairs.</p>

<p>When she got back in her room she started going through her things so she
could find something to wear. She heard Faith shifting in the bed as she
opened and closed several dresser drawers. "B, you're supposed to let me
sleep," Faith said, trying to sound angry. It was hard though, considering
her girlfriend just started changing in front of her. "Actually, now that I
think of it, I've got a few better ideas than sleep."</p>

<p>Buffy finished pulling on her jeans and smiled at Faith. "You had your
chance, but you wanted to sleep. Now I've got to get back to campus for
class."</p>

<p>"You're so mean B," Faith complained as she watched Buffy.</p>

<p>"I know, but it's why you love me." Buffy bent down and gave her girlfriend
a quick kiss. "Cordy and Missy are downstairs sleeping, so don't wake them
up. I think they probably had a long night," Buffy's grin grew as she
thought about that. "Hey, why'd you make that dare anyways?"</p>

<p>Faith shrugged slightly as she sat up in the bed, already awake, though she
wished she were sleeping still. "I thought it was funny. I never knew her
and Queen C would hit it off like that," Faith replied.</p>

<p>"I know! You're living vicariously through Missy," Faith gave Buffy a
baffled look while trying not to laugh at the expression on her face. "I
mean, you're stuck with me, so since Missy looks like you if she's with
Cordy it's like you get to see yourself with Cordy but not. I'm not making
sense am I?" Buffy asked and Faith just shook her head.</p>

<p>"Try not to think so much this early B," Faith told her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah. I'm going now," Buffy gave Faith a quick kiss. "Be good and
I'll see you tonight at the Bronze." Buffy gave her one last smile and
walked out, and Faith layed back down, hoping to get some more sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>That night the whole gang gathered at the Bronze like usual, and with Cordy
there it almost felt like old times. Buffy and Faith were out on the dance
floor, dancing to whatever the DJ played until it was time for the band that
was playing to come on. Willow was talking to the newest member of the gang,
Tara, excitedly about more spells. Oz was listening to the conversation,
though no one could actually tell if he was interested in it or not. Xander
however was the only one who wasn't at ease. He couldn't help but notice the
looks his ex girlfriend kept giving Missy, and it was starting to bother
him.</p>

<p>"So what brings you back to town?" Xander asked Cordelia, trying to see if
he could figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>"Just visiting," she said carelessly, only taking her eyes from Missy for a
brief second to look at him.</p>

<p>"Xander's mine now," Anya told her rather forcefully. "I've heard about you,
but you can't have him anymore."</p>

<p>"It's okay, I've found someone else now," Cordy replied with a smile to
Anya.</p>

<p>"Who might that be?" Xander questioned.</p>

<p>"Duh, isn't it obvious? It's Missy," Cordy told him, and his eyes went wide.</p>

<p>"You and her?" Xander asked softly. "How? When? Why?" He shook his head as
if in disbelief. He suddenly started wondering what it was with his ex's
turning gay.</p>

<p>"It just happened last night. We got down and dirty on Buffy's couch and
decided we liked it," Missy said, and no one could tell if she was actually
joking or not. It got the rest of the gang's attention, and it even seemed
as if Buffy and Faith knew things were going to get interesting because they
returned to the table.</p>

<p>"What's with all the creepy faces?" Buffy asked as she sat down on Faith's
lap.</p>

<p>"Did you know about them?" Xander asked her, as he looked at  Cordelia
still. "Is everyone here gay now? First them, now you two." He looked at
Willow almost pleadingly. "You're still into Oz right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I love my Oz," Willow said happily.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the answer Xander turned to the girl he had just met. "What
about you?"</p>

<p>Tara seemed to have blushed, and she looked at the gang. "W-what about me?"
she asked trying to avoid the question.</p>

<p>"Do you like girls?" Xander cleared up for her.</p>

<p>"Y-yeah," she admitted shyly and for some reason she expected a bad reaction
from her new friends. Faith just looked at her proudly and Xander threw his
hands up in exasperation.</p>

<p>"I like boys," Anya stated as she clung to Xander's arm.</p>

<p>"Thank God," he muttered before giving her a kiss.</p>

<p>Just then a band took the stage and as quickly as the conversation started
it ended. When the first song began, Cordy grabbed her head in obvious pain
and everyone turned to look at her. Everyone except for Oz, who seemed to be
just as entranced by the singer as she was by him. Willow didn't even
noticed as she worried about her friend, who was seemingly having a vision.
Tara was the only one to notice Oz's distraction and she shook her head
before turning her attention to Cordy.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the ex cheerleader recovered and smiled sheepishly at
the gang. "Looks like I'm going back to LA tomorrow morning," Cordy told
Missy, who was looking at her confused. "I get visions, it kinda has to do
with that whole hellmouth thing," she tried to explain.</p>

<p>"But your not supposed to leave that early," Missy sounded upset as she
looked at Cordelia. She knew the girl was going to have to leave so any sort
of real relationship with her would be impossible for now, but it didn't
mean she wanted to be away from her yet.</p>

<p>"I know, and I don't want to go back either. Well correction, I want to go
back but I want you to come with me. But I know you can't because of school
and all," Cordelia let out a soft sigh. "However, you are coming with me,
school or not," Cordelia pointed to Tara, and everyone looked at her
wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"M-me?" Tara questioned, though she knew that she had to go as well. She
could feel it.</p>

<p>"Look, I saw you. You were there so you have to come back to LA with me. I
don't know exactly what it's all about, but these things are never wrong.
Obviously we need your help with something, so come back with me in the
morning," Cordy more demanded than stated.</p>

<p>Tara nodded slowly and the whole gang seemed confused. They looked at
Cordelia waiting for answers about what she saw and how it involved Tara.
While she explained what she could of it, Willow finally noticed that Oz
still hadn't taken his eyes off the singer of the band on stage. She
suddenly lost interest in what Cordelia was talking about, even though it
involved her new friend, as she felt her boyfriend slipping even farther
away from her.</p>
