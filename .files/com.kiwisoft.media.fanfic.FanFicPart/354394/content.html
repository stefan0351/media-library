<!-- Interludis Neanderthalensis \ Part Three -->

<p><i>The hands that rested on her hips were profoundly gentle, while the green eyes that
stared into her own were dark with worry. A tender hand brushed silky bangs back from her
brow and then she tasted soft lips against her own. The kiss was full of a leisurely sort
of passion possible only when two people have been lovers for a long time and Buffy sank
into it, losing herself in the sweet comfort. &quot;Willow,&quot; she exhaled when their
lips parted. Again the gentle smile. </p>

<p>&quot;You okay?&quot; the redhead questioned, her fingers still stroking Buffy's hair back
from her forehead.</i> <i>&quot;I was worried when I got back from my meeting late and you
were already gone.&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer laughed mockingly and turned away from eyes that saw too much. &quot;Define
okay,&quot; she said grimly.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause before Willow commented dryly, &quot;Well, I guess that answers
that question.&quot; Buffy didn't have time to try and escape before she was enveloped in
a warm hug from behind, then she felt the familiar weight of Willow's chin on her shoulder
and soft lips against the curve of her shoulder. &quot;I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy could feel the tension in her chest underlying the soreness in overtired muscles.
&quot;I'm slowing down, Will.&quot; The words were out of her mouth before she could call
a halt to the thought.</p>

<p>The silence stretched out between them as Buffy felt Willow tense. &quot;It's going to be
okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy pulled free as she spun, unable to contain the anger and frustration burning in her
breast. &quot;I'm thirty-five, Will. That's older than any Slayer...ever...and I'm slowing
down. I wouldn't have made it this far if it wasn't you and Giles...and Xander...and
everyone else...&quot;</p>

<p>Willow swallowed hard, sweeping a hand back through her elegantly cut, shoulder-length
hair, trying not to let her own fears show. &quot;We'll get you through,&quot; she swore
intently. </p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. &quot;How...you can't magic every vampire in the world away, and
there is no retirement program for Slayers...I'm ten years older than any Slayer who's
come before me...&quot; Left unsaid was the welling pit of fear that her life was drawing
close to the end of its cycle.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not going to let that happen,&quot; Willow insisted, but Buffy cut in a hard
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you expect to stop it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If this is because--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not,&quot; Buffy cut her off harshly, then softened her voice as she drew close
once again. &quot;I love you,&quot; she whispered and reached out, touching Willow's cheek
tenderly. &quot;More than my life.&quot; Buffy swallowed hard, struggling to force air
past the tightness in her throat as she continued, &quot;To the point where I can barely
remember a time when I didn't love you.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow framed Buffy's face in her hands, eyes blazing as she leaned into her lover's
space. &quot;Then trust me,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I'm so close, but if you let go none
of it matters.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy let her head fall forward until her forehead was resting against her lover's.
&quot;I'm just so tired of the fight,&quot; she sighed sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;Trust me,&quot; Willow whispered near her ear, and Buffy took comfort from the
intensity of love she could hear in her voice. No matter what happened, Willow was the one
constant in her life. She lifted her head from Willow's slender shoulder, surprised as
always by the strength in her lover's seemingly fragile and all too mortal frame. The fear
she felt for her own future was nothing next to her fear that she'd be too slow one night
when Willow was with her and miss the threat that would finally cost her lover for her
fidelity. As if sensing the thoughts going through Buffy's head, Willow tucked a finger
under her chin, forcing her to truly focus on her. &quot;I have loved you since I was
sixteen years old...my entire adult life,&quot; she whispered intently, &quot;I will
always love you...&quot; She paused, taking a deep breath before she continued. &quot;And
I would rather die with you than live without you, but I am not planning on that.&quot;
She held on tight to Buffy's chin when she would have looked away. &quot;I plan on living
a long life with you, but you <b>have</b> to trust me. Even the mighty Slayer has to let
someone help them now and then.&quot;Willow leaned forward and brushed a kiss over her
lover's soft lips, reminding Buffy that there was more than one way of avoiding thoughts
of vampires and mortality.</p>

<p>A slow smile lifted the Slayer's full lips. &quot;Talk me into it,&quot; she challenged,
her eyes suddenly gleaming with passion. She needed to escape the worry and terror of her
life, needed to touch her lover and feel alive again.</p>

<p>Willow braced her hands against the wall on either side of Buffy's head while her lips
lifted in a smile full of erotic promise. &quot;I dunno...are you sure you're worth the
effort?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ow,&quot; Buffy exhaled. &quot;Now, there's a dare if ever I heard one.&quot; She
leaned forward, almost, but not quite touching her Willow's smooth cheek. </p>

<p>&quot;Mmm, maybe I'm curious to see how hard you're willing to work.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy inhaled the sweet perfume of her lover's skin as she lifted her hands to the belt of
Willow's robe, gently tugging it loose to slip her hands inside and find the warm curves
she knew so well. Agile fingers easily found the telltale signs of arousal as they stroked
velvety skin. &quot;Methinks the lady doth protest too much,&quot; she whispered and felt
Willow shiver in response. &quot;In fact, methinks I don't have to work at all.&quot; They
were cheek to cheek, still not quite touching, enjoying the game of flirting and teasing,
needing the heady pleasure to last as long as possible. </p>

<p>&quot;Do it anyway,&quot; Willow invited and leaned more heavily against the wall. </p>

<p>And then they kissed, mouths meeting, parting briefly, then meeting again in broad,
open-mouthed kisses that were as intimate as any caress could be. Long minutes passed as
they simply shared themselves that way, then Buffy trailed her lips along the arch of
Willow's cheekbone, tasting her skin before fluttering tiny kisses down the arch of her
throat. The Wiccan's throat muscles worked convulsively, the tiny sounds Buffy had always
found so erotic erupting from her slightly parted lips. She spread the silky robe wider,
dusting kisses on silky pale flesh, drinking in the tiny tremors and whimpers of arousal
as her lips moved lower.</p>

<p>Willow's head fell forward, her hair shading her face in a silky crimson curtain, while
she was forced to lean more heavily against the wall to remain on her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you know,&quot; Buffy whispered between pressing tiny kisses over Willow's
taut stomach, &quot;that this means you've surrendered any future rights to complain about
my work ethic.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow groaned softly. &quot;Cancel all my future visits to the complaint
department,&quot; she panted. Buffy was kneeling between her lover and the wall,
supernaturally strong hands stroking rounded hips and slender legs, while her lips danced
and painted erotic designs. They were both bathed in perspiration, muscles quivering,
perfectly tuned to one another's wants and needs. Buffy tipped her head back on her
shoulders, staring up at Willow's downbent head, taking in the expressions that
quicksilvered across her fine features. &quot;I love you,&quot; she whispered very softly.</p>

<p>Willow smiled, her eyes burning with need as she whispered. &quot;Say it again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you,&quot; Buffy breathed and stood, dragging her lips up the length of
Willow's body before reclaiming her lips. She tasted her lover's breath, held her close as
she felt the first shudders wrack her slender frame, then felt her own body react to
overwhelming sensuality of the moment. Their mouths blended as they clung to one another,
so close they were almost one body, their pleasure shared as it arced from one to the
other, then back again, never stopping, always moving back and forth between them,
building and growing with each passing moment until they were the center of a maelstrom
that might never end.</p>

<p>Buffy felt Willow's fingers combing through her hair as she was pulled even closer, then
their kiss broke and she felt soft lips trail along the curve of her jaw, then nibble on
her ear. &quot;The answers are there, Buffy...trust me to find them...trust yourself...we
can do this--&quot;</p>

<p></i>Buffy Summers awoke with a gasp, momentarily confusing the reality and the dream as
she opened her eyes to find her nose buried in silky red hair, the smell of Willow's
shampoo filling her senses, just as the warmth of Willow's body filled her arms. She
blinked in the darkness, lifting her head, careful not to wake the slender figure lying so
peacefully in her arms as she looked around herself. It took a moment to recognize their
shared dorm room in the darkness and from the altered position on Willow's bed--on
Willow's bed. Buffy mentally repeated the phrase, turning it over in her mind as she
pushed up just enough to stare down at the figure lying trustingly in her arms, her face
relaxed in sleep. Even in the faint light, Willow's pale skin glowed softly, while long
dark lashes fanned onto gently rounded cheeks. Buffy frowned, head canting to one side as
she studied her friend's features, silently comparing them to the Willow in her dream.
That Willow had been older, more confident, even elegant, her youthful gamine charm
matured into an exotic beauty. Buffy started to reach out and touch her cheek, but caught
herself mid movement and yanked her hand back. God, what was she thinking? It was just a
dream, not a prophecy or anything like. Just a dream caused by her overactive hormones in
combination with the smell of Willow's shampoo. </p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that she'd spent the evening kissing and showering with her best
friend in a bout of primevally laced beer drunkies.</p>

<p>Oh, well, that was special.</p>

<p>Buffy tipped her head down, paling another appalled notch as she remembered it all, from
the dorm paintings of Lascaux, to bonking Parker, to climbing naked into the shower with
Willow and demanding cleaning services. Buffy Summers wondered if running away again was
completely out of the question. Good lord, she was lucky Willow hadn't simply run
screaming into the night. </p>

<p>She shivered with sensory memory as she remembered the feeling of Willow's soap slicked
hands sliding over her skin.. </p>

<p>Or maybe she was just lucky that the wolfy version of Oz hadn't been anywhere in residence
to tear her throat out.</p>

<p>Willow shifted ever so slightly, drawing Buffy's gaze back down. This time she did reach
out and tenderly brushed silky red bangs back from Willow's brow as she felt her chest
tighten with emotions she wasn't sure she had the courage to face.</p>

<p>Buffy was still contemplating whether or not to resist the emotional epiphany that was
fast threatening to turn her world on its edge when Willow turned her head ever so
slightly, blinking muzzily.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; the hacker mumbled.</p>

<p>The Slayer pulled her hand back, instinctively tugging the sheet over her bare breasts as
she smiled a little embarrassedly. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she whispered as she was overcome by
a total brain-spazz that robbed her of any ability to decide what to do next.</p>

<p>Willow twisted a little farther, brows drawing into a frown as she stared up at her
friend. &quot;I mean, you're the real Buffy?&quot; she said a little hesitantly, her voice
lifting at the end and turning the comment into a question.</p>

<p>&quot;As real as I ever get,&quot; Buffy responded with a faint shrug.</p>

<p>A moment of uncertain silence stretched between them.</p>

<p>&quot;I...um...how much do you remember?&quot; Willow asked at last.</p>

<p><i>Well, that's the sixty-four thousand dollar question</i>, Buffy thought, because she
remembered every last bit of it and that was scary as hell. For both of them she
suspected. &quot;Not much,&quot; she lied in a panic. &quot;It's all pretty foggy. I think
I hit Parker though.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's lips tipped up in a sleepy grin. &quot;You did...you hit him...and it was
good...&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy shared the infectious grin, almost forgetting for a moment that she was stark naked
and lying in bed with her best friend while having thoughts she wasn't entirely
comfortable having, after having a dream that she was distinctly <i>un</i>comfortable
about having. </p>

<p>&quot;But it wasn't exactly you...well, not the evolved you anyways. You kind of had a
witchy microbrew beer that turned you into a neanderthal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was still a good response,&quot; Buffy decided out loud.</p>

<p>Willow chuckled. &quot;Yeah...it was...&quot; She rolled more on her back, the movement
brushing their bare legs together and reminding the Slayer of all that discomfort. </p>

<p>Buffy tightened her hold on the sheet across her breasts, swallowing hard.
&quot;I...uh...well, I should probably get back to my own bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow was grateful for the darkness as she felt her face heat with the force of her
answering blush. &quot;Y-you...you didn't seem to like...well...clothes very much...and I
think you weren't too fond of...&quot; Willow's brain raced as she hunted for a way to
explain their sleeping arrangements that didn't involve<i> explaining</i> their sleeping
arrangements. &quot;I think maybe it was the cold or the dark...I'm not really sure,&quot;
she got out in a babble.</p>

<p>And they both fell silent again.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I really should be getting back to my own bed,&quot; Buffy said again though
she still wasn't moving or making any attempt to move her arm out from under the weight of
Willow's body.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Willow exhaled.</p>

<p>&quot;Will, I...&quot; Buffy started to whisper, not planning the way she leaned closer.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Willow breathed. </p>

<p>Their lips drew nearer, almost touching.</p>

<p>And then someone screamed.</p>

<p>Buffy jackknifed into a sitting position, forgetting her nudity in the face of possible
trouble as she bounded across Willow to land lightly on her feet next to the bed.</p>

<p>Another scream rang across the night and now that she was listening for it and not
involved in other pursuits, she was certain it was outside the dorm, but not very far
away. She shoved their window open, staring out into the dark night. Another scream and
Buffy spotted movement in a darkened corner next to the building not far from the north
exit door. She pulled back and started toward the door, only to momentarily pull up short
as Willow thrust the robe that had been discarded earlier into her line of vision.</p>

<p>&quot;You might want this,&quot; the hacker pointed out with a tiny gesture at Buffy's
body, while her eyes remained firmly on her friend's face.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Buffy muttered and slung the garment on, yanking the belt tight even
as she was lunging through their door.</p>

<p>Willow paused only long enough to grab a crossbow and a handful of bolts from the weapons
locker under Buffy's bed, then hurried out after her friend.</p>

<p>People were sticking their heads out of their dorm rooms, bleary with sleep and there were
more than a few complaints and grumbles. Buffy heard none of it as she hit the door that
opened onto the emergency stairwell, taking the stairs two at a time as she hurried toward
the sound. Finally, she hit the ground floor and burst through the exit door that led to
the outside, so involved in the hunt that she barely felt the chill fall air that caressed
her bare skin. Perhaps a minute had passed since they'd heard the first cry.</p>

<p>And nothing was moving.</p>

<p>Buffy did a slow pivot, braced in a fighter's stance and ready for anything, but there was
nothing there, only the steady rasp of her own breathing.</p>

<p>Only a moment passed before the door at her back was pushed open and Willow stepped
through, the crossbow in her fine boned hands loaded and ready for action. If there had
been any action to find. &quot;Well?&quot; the hacker demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head slowly. &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>The world was still as death, buildings gleaming faintly under the light of a hunter's
moon, while trees and shrubs cast deep, impenetrable shadows. An army could have been
moving through that and they couldn't have seen it.</p>

<p>&quot;Vamps?&quot; Willow questioned and Buffy shrugged.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe...my spidey sense isn't doing the tingle, but that doesn't always mean a whole
lot. Of course it could also be any one of a thousand demons doing Club Sunnydale on their
vacation, a few more pre-evolution frat boys, or nothing more than a freshman prank.&quot;
She started down the steps, already moving toward the thick vegetation as she ordered
Willow over her shoulder, &quot;Stay here. I'm just going to check it out.&quot;</p>

<p>The hacker's knuckles whitened against the polished wooden surface of the crossbow as she
watched her friend move away, almost blending into the darkness. Something was not right,
but she couldn't quite put her finger on it, or maybe it was just that not quite right was
standard operating procedure in Sunnydale. Being situated over a Hellmouth kinda did that
to a town as far as Willow could tell, especially when the town in question was Sunnydale
and had been started for the express purpose of eventually feeding a demon. She stood
guard though, watching the undergrowth with the crossbow held tightly in hand, ready to
provide Buffy back up if she could. Long moments later, she took a half step back while
trying to see better. And nearly went down as her bare foot skidded in a thick puddle of
something viscous. Willow regained her balance and hopped aside, careful not to get her
other foot in the stuff, then crouched down, reaching out to touch her fingers to it, then
lifted them to sniff the substance. She recognized the familiar metallic smell instantly.
Blood. &quot;Buffy,&quot; the Slayer's name came out as a tiny squeak too low to be heard
by anyone more than a few feet away. The redhead was just drawing breath to call out more
loudly when something creaked in the shadows to her right. Willow turned toward the sound,
bringing the crossbow to bear.</p>

<p>&quot;Ease off on that trigger,&quot; Buffy's voice floated out of the darkness as she
stepped from the shadows. &quot;Unless, of course, you're in the mood for
Slayer-kabob.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow tipped the weapon up as she pushed to her feet. &quot;Find anything?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. &quot;There were some broken branches in the hedge. Could have been
some kind of altercation...or a drunken frat rat might have fallen into it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd vote for the altercation,&quot; Willow said and crouched back down, pointing to
the quickly drying stain on the cement landing. &quot;Because that's blood.&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer bounded up beside her friend, dropping to a half crouch as she looked at the
smear.</p>

<p>She reached out and touched it, none too thrilled that she recognized the feel and smell
so easily. &quot;Well, whatever happened,&quot; she murmured at last and nodded toward the
east, where the sky was lightening to a soft shade of violet in anticipation of the coming
morning. &quot;It looks like it's over for the night.&quot; They shared a knowing look.
&quot;Come on,&quot; Buffy said and tugged the exit door open. &quot;Let's get back
inside. I'll come back down and get a sample of the blood...just to make sure it's
human.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Willow agreed, stepping through the open door as her friend held it open
for her. She brushed up against Buffy and looked up, naked emotion momentarily showing in
her gaze. </p>

<p>The Slayer's breath caught and both girls froze, sharing a long look that asked more
questions than it answered. Buffy swallowed hard, wondering what the hell was happening to
her as she found herself contemplating what it would be like to kiss her best friend
without any interference from bewitched beer. Suddenly, she yanked herself back from the
thought as she reminded herself that even if Willow were so inclined, she was solidly with
Oz--Oz, right, Willow's boyfriend--and Buffy had never regarded herself as the sort of
person who chased those who were already involved. <i>And Willow <b>is</b> involved</i>,
she reminded herself again as she stared into the trap of soft green eyes. The Slayer
straightened her shoulders and pulled back a fraction. &quot;You go on...I know you've got
to get ready for your eight am class...and Oz'll be by to pick you up in a little
while.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow flinched as she was reminded of her boyfriend, but she didn't move away, just
continued staring at her friend. &quot;Buffy?&quot; she whispered at last. She was feeling
more than a little weird, as though she was being pulled in two directions at once and she
didn't know what to do about it.</p>

<p>The Slayer's expression was soft as she whispered, &quot;Go on. I'll be up in a couple of
minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>Her expression uncertain, Willow paused a beat, then finally stepped inside. Buffy let the
door close in her wake, took a deep breath and let it slowly to release some of the
tension built up in her muscles, while she closed her eyes and tried to let the cool air
clear her head. It didn't help much, but she did quickly become aware of the fact that
daylight was fast approaching, people were starting to move around on campus, and she was
wearing a very brief robe and nothing more. Emotional turmoil aside, inside was suddenly
looking very good. She flashed an embarrassed smile at a passing jogger, then pivoted and
hurried back inside. Epiphanies, unrequited love, sexual confusion, and neo-jurassic
multi-person showers were one thing, total public humiliation quite another. </p>

<p>Buffy never saw the dark clothed figure that came around the corner of the building just
as she entered, a cellular phone pressed against one ear. &quot;Yes, I have the Slayer
under surveillance now.&quot; Dark eyes scanned the campus as it continued coming back to
life, no longer overrun with demonic presences that sought to devour the living, though
they would be back once night fell again. Ethan Rayne smiled. He'd rather liked college
and he suspected he was going to enjoy this latest little opportunity to experience higher
learning. &quot;You just remember our deal.&quot; A moment later, he clicked the phone off
and slid it into his inner coat pocket, pausing only momentarily to wipe the last of the
blood off of his fingers with the handkerchief tucked in the inner pocket. Obviously, the
original owner had been the neat sort. Rayne's smile broadened a notch. &quot;Well, don't
worry, old chap, I'll make sure it's well cared for,&quot; he drawled to no one in
particular as he strolled away, whistling an old tune from his childhood and tried to
remember the lyrics. Something about worms crawling in and out. How appropriate, since
soon enough, the Slayer would know that feeling very well....</font></p>
