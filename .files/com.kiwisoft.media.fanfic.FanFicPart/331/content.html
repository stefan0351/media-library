<!-- Telling Series \ Section 1: Mom - Bombs Away -->

<p>"Sam," Jane started as she sat down to join Sam at the table
for breakfast. "Can we talk?" Sam looked up at her mother and was instantly
alarmed. Seventeen years of living with her mother had trained her to interpret
certain facial expressions well. And the one Jane was wearing now meant one of
two things: either she was in trouble or her mother had bad news. Since she had
just cleaned her room and could think of nothing else she could have done to get
herself in trouble, Sam figured her mother must have bad news. </p>
<p>"Sure, Mom, what's the scoop?" Sam asked, as her mother seemed
to hedge. Jane sighed. Alarm bell number two. </p>
<p>"I'm not sure how to go about talking about this," Jane
explained. Alarm bell number three. </p>
<p>"Can't be that bad, Mom. We've always had a relationship were
we could talk about anything so, lay it on me." Sam felt a little hypocritical
about that last part seeing as how she had yet to tell her mother about the fact
that she was in a romantic relationship with Brooke. </p>
<p>But everytime the two of them discussed telling their parents
that the reason they were getting along so well and seemed so close lately was
because they were, well, close, they always ended up playing out the worst case
scenarios. One of them always ended up either in Siberia or buried in the deep
forests of Washington State. Neither one of them could manage to be optimists
about the outcome of their parents discovering their relationship. They were in
no way ashamed by it; in fact, they'd shout it from the mountain tops if they
could (insert Sound of Music joke here) but they knew Mike and Jane were not
going to take the news well. </p>
<p>"I've always felt that way, Sam, but lately it doesn't seem
that way anymore." If the bells in Sam's head got any louder she was sure Jane
would be able to hear them. </p>
<p>"Why not?" (Ask a loaded question and you're going to get a
loaded answer) Sam warned herself. </p>
<p>"You've been keeping things from me," Jane pointed out. Sam
looked away ashamed. </p>
<p>"I told you that copy of Playboy was Carmen's," (when all else
fails, deflect the topic and then blame someone else) Jane sighed again.
</p>
<p>"When were you going to tell me about you and Brooke?" Sam
choked on a mouthful of Rice Krispies and Jane had to pound her on the back to
clear her airway. </p>
<p>"What about us?" Sam rasped after clearing her lungs. (Wasn't
expecting that one) </p>
<p>"Sam," Jane said in a warning tone. Sam chose to ignore it. </p>
<p>"I mean, yeah we're getting along well lately. So what? We
can't be expected to hate each other forever especially now that Mac's around. I
mean what kind of environment is that for her to grow up in?" Sam babbled, using
her best known defense, words, to keep her mother from the truth. Her mother
shook her head. </p>
<p>"Sam, honey, I know about you and Brooke?" Sam interrupted
her, continuing her rant. </p>
<p>"And she was there for me after Nicole hit me with her car.
OK, so Nic was aiming for her, but still, Brooke never left my side. That sort
of thing brings people closer, you know?" Jane put her hand over Sam's to get
her attention. </p>
<p>"Sam stop," Jane commanded gently. Sam looked up and to Jane,
she looked absolutely terrified. "I'm not talking about that. I think that it's
great that the two of you got past your differences, but I know there's more to
it." Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Sam lied. She did,
she was just praying that Jane didn't. </p>
<p>"That's what I mean, Sam. You never used to lie to me. But
you've been doing it for a while now. Don't you feel that you can talk to me
anymore?" Jane sounded hurt and it broke Sam's heart. </p>
<p>"Sure I can, Mom. And I do." </p>
<p>"Then why didn't you tell me about you and Brooke?" Sam got up
from the table and started to pace. </p>
<p>"Why do you keep coming back to that? God, obssessive much?"
Jane smiled despite herself as she watched Sam pace and wring her hands.
Seventeen years of watching her daughter's mannerisms had taught her to read her
daughter very well. Sam was nervous, upset and a tad bit panicked. Her
observations were how she figured the whole thing out anyway. </p>
<p>Even before Nicole's ill concieved attempt at drag racing,
Jane had started to notice a subtle change in both Brooke and Sam. It began with
small glances, stolen when they thought no one, especially the other was
looking. Then small touches when passing the other or reaching across the table
at dinner. And the fighting had died down to something liveable, neither she nor
Mike were afraid to leave Sam and Brooke alone together for fear of imminent
bloodshed. They were actually getting along. </p>
<p>And then there was the look in their eyes when they looked at
each other. Never at anytime had Jane seen that look in the eyes of either girl.
It was a look Jane had only seen a few times before herself. She saw it when
Jack, her first husband had looked at her and now when Mike looked at her. It
was love. At first she put it off to her imagination, then she chalked it up to
infatuation, a common teen-age phase (denial, she was very good at denial). But
then she watched as the look grew in intensity in both girls although they both
seemed unaware. </p>
<p>And then the accident happened. And Jane saw how devasated
Brooke was. If the girl hadn't been standing there right in front of her, she
would have sworn the car had hit her too. As Sam lay in a coma, Brooke's life
had effectively come to a standstill until the day Sam finally woke up. It was
like Brooke began breathing, living again that day as well. She was no fool,
Jane realized then that whatever was going on was no phase and wouldn't go away
if she ignored it. </p>
<p>She watched, as Brooke was there every step of Sam's recovery
and how Sam accepted Brooke's help when she wouldn't anyone else's. She noticed
how both girls leaned on and counted on the other to get past the hard parts and
bumps in the road during Sam's long journey to recuperation. And she saw how
something had changed after she and Mike had returned from Utah but she hadn't
been able to figure out what. </p>
<p>"Sam, you can either talk to me now or we can wait for Mike
and Brooke to come back from Nevada tomorrow and the four of us can sit down
together and have this conversation. And set down some ground rules," the look
of sheer horror and fear that stuck itself to Sam's face was nearly enough to
break Jane's resolve. Sam was obviously terrified to talk to her about this but
Jane could understand why. Given the closeness of their relationship, Sam was
bound to fear being turned away by the only parent she had left because of who
she loved. But Jane wouldn't do that. She just had to let Sam know that.
</p>
<p>"No! God, no!" Sam panicked. All the color drained from her
face and she froze in place. "You wanna talk? Talk. Just don't drag Mike into
this, please," she begged desperately. "He'll kill me and toss me in a wood
chipper. Do we own a wood chipper?" </p>
<p>"All right, Sam, calm down. We don't own a wood chipper and no
one is killing anyone. Start at the beginning. What is going on between the two
of you and when did it start?" Sam gulped down some air and tried to calm down. </p>
<p>"Going on? I suppose it's too late to say nothing?" Jane shot
her a dirty look. "OK, well, to put it simply, I love her, am in love with her.
And she loves me. I'm sorry if that's hard to handle, Mom, really I am. I never
meant for it to happen, it just sort of did." </p>
<p>"When, Sammy? When did you realize this?" </p>
<p>"A while ago, before the car accident if that's what you're
asking. Things with George never really went anywhere and the whole Harrison
mess. God, don't get me started. I started to see that my feelings for Brooke
were leaning towards the not so sweet and innocent. But I swear to you, Mom, I
was never going to do anything about them. I know how much you love Mike, as
much as I was against him to start with and I would never, ever do anything to
ruin that for you. Honest." </p>
<p>"I know you wouldn't, honey. Brooke feels the same way?" </p>
<p>"Yeah, and trust me I was just as surprised as you. I mean, I
always thought Brooke was straight. There was Josh and Harrison?" Sam trailed
off. (Gee, for someone who claims to never get the girl, Harrison factors in an
awful lot here. But then, he still didn't get the girl, or girls in this case,
we got each other. Gonna be one heck of a blow to his ego when he finds out) </p>
<p>"I thought you were straight," Jane reminded her. Sam blushed
slightly. </p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, so did I. Seems we were wrong, on both counts," Sam
joked. Jane scowled. </p>
<p>"This really isn't the time for jokes, Sam," Jane reprimanded.
Sam looked away, properly chastised and sat back down. </p>
<p>"I know. Sorry," she apologized. </p>
<p>"So, you and Brooke are together, as a couple?" Jane asked to
reconfirm what she already knew. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, we are," she looked back at her mother, a strength and
resolve there in her eyes that hadn't been a moment ago. "And nothing you say or
do is going to change that. This isn't a phase or an experiment. We genuinely
love one another. She makes me feel like no one else ever has, like no one else
ever will. You can move me to Australia, or Antarctica but it won't change the
way I feel. Nothing will. You can't dictate the will of my heart, Mom. Time,
distance, or death is not going to change anything." Jane sat there stunned by
the heartfelt and powerful confession. </p>
<p>"I'm not asking you to change, Sam, I'm asking you to be
honest with me. That's all," she said when she could speak. The depth of Sam's
feelings for Brooke left her momentarily speechless. </p>
<p>"I just was, Mom," Sam put her head on the table. "And I think
I'm going to be sick." Jane reached out and stroked Sam's back to soothe her. </p>
<p>"I think you are very brave to tell me all that. Have you said
that to Brooke?" Sam shook her head, still keeping it against the table. "I
think you should, it was very beautiful." Sam looked up and Jane could see the
unshead tears shimmering there. </p>
<p>"Do you think any less of me now that you know I'm gay?" Sam
asked, her voice small and vulnerable. One single tear spilled over and fell
down her face. Jane wiped it away. </p>
<p>"I could never think any less of you for being honest with
yourself and with me, Sam. True it's not a choice I would have made for you but
I understand that you love whom you love. I'm not going to take that away."
Tears of relief streamed down Sam's face. She got up and hugged Jane.
</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mom. I feel so relieved," she cried. "You're not
going to sent me away?" Jane shook her head. "Oh thank God." They sat in
compatable silence for several minutes before Jane spoke again. </p>
<p>"Honey, I still have a few questions for you," Sam sat back
down, a look of dread spreading across her features. </p>
<p>"Please tell me you're not going to ask what I think you're
going to ask," Sam begged. </p>
<p>"Have you and Brooke,?have the two of you been intimate," Sam
shot up off her chair like she'd been catapulted off of it. </p>
<p>"Mooooommmmm," she wailed. "What kind of question is that?
What happened to boundries and respecting my privacy? I just tell you that I'm
involved in a romantic relationship with your stepdaughter and now you want to
know the status of my virginity? There is such thing as too much personal
information, you know. I don't ask you about you and Mike, do I? I mean, is this
information really relevant? I mean, hello, personal space!" </p>
<p>"Sam, breathe," Jane reminded her quickly hyperventilating
daughter. During her little rant, Sam had been scurring about the kitchen like a
hummingbird. It actually would have been considered cute if Sam weren't
desperately trying to avoid answering the question. </p>
<p>"OK, I'm breathing. But still, Mom, geesh," Sam complained
dramatically. </p>
<p>"So you have," Jane assumed by Sam's violent reaction to the
question. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Relax Mom. No, we haven't. I'll be honest and tell you it's
not for lack of trying on my part," Jane paled and Sam blushed. "We are 'so' not
having this conversation." </p>
<p>"No, no, really, Sam. Tell me, it's all right," Jane
encouraged her. "I want you to feel that you can be honest with me again." </p>
<p>"Well, OK, and I can't believe I'm about to tell you this,"
she quirked an eyebrow and tilted her head. "Are you sure about this Mom?" Jane
nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, I want our relationship to be the honest and open one it
once was. This doesn't change that, Sammy, you're still my daughter."
</p>
<p>"OK, but I warned you. You see, I've wanted to, you know, take
the next step but Brook keeps putting the brakes on. I think her experience with
Josh has made her nervous and she's worried that sex'll ruin our relationship
but it's not like that, Mom. I mean, sure I love Brooke's body, I mean, wow, but
I love more than that. It's never been about sex. I love her mind, her soul and
everything about her. I'm not sure she realizes that." </p>
<p>"Have you told her?" </p>
<p>"I think so," Sam tilted her head again. "Are we actually
having this conversation?" Jane laughed. </p>
<p>"Yes, and I asked the original question, not to butt into your
person space, but to make sure you didn't jump into something you're not ready
for. But it looks like I had nothing to fear. If you're telling me the truth,
and I have no reason to think otherwise, than I trust you to do what is right
for you and Brooke. But I really think you need to tell Brooke the things you
told me. I think she needs to and would like to hear such loving and kind
words." </p>
<p>"So you're OK with all this?" </p>
<p>"OK? No, but I will be. I'll just need a little more time. I
believe you when you say that this is for real, Sam. You can't fake the feelings
you're talking about or the way I've seen you look at Brooke, or the way I've
seen her look at you. So, yes, eventually I'll be OK." </p>
<p>"What about Mike?" </p>
<p>"Why don't we talk to Brooke first and let her know that I
know and try to figure things out from there?" </p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan." </p>
<p>"Until then, behave yourselves, OK?" Sam grinned impishly. </p>
<p>"I always do, I have no idea what you may be insinuating," she
said innocently. </p>
<p>"Sam," Jane started in that `Mom' tone everyone loathes to
hear. "You two share a bathroom, don't make us have to move your rooms."
</p>
<p>"Oh, kinda like turning the car around if we don't behave,
huh?" Jane nodded. "OK, got it. I'll pass the word on. No passing go, no
collecting 200 dollars, so noted. Is that everything?" </p>
<p>"Are you happy?" </p>
<p>"My final answer? Yes, completely, totally, utterly and
exhaustively happy. Like I never was before. I never realized I wasn't happy,
Mom. I guess I needed to have my eyes opened to see what was missing in my life:
Brooke." </p>
<p>"You really should say these things to her, you know," Jane
advised. </p>
<p>"I will. How long until they get back?" Sam whined.
</p>
<p>"Tomorrow night, Sam. Don't worry, you'll make it," Jane
hugged her tightly. Sam sighed with relief. </p>
<p>"I don't know about you but I feel much better now," Sam
admitted. </p>
<p>"Me too, Sammy. I'm just sorry that you felt you couldn't be
honest with me to start with." </p>
<p>"I'm sorry too, Mom. But I swear that's the last secret I'll
ever keep from you," Sam promised. </p>
<p>"I hope so. So you really thought you'd be tossed in a wood
chipper?" </p>
