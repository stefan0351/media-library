<p><i>"It was like...like finally getting to spend time with her. The side of my mother I never knew."</i></p>
<p><i>"To give that up she must have loved you so much."</i></p>
<p><i>"Canary loved you Dinah, you know that.  She loved you so much she gave her life for you."</i></p>
<p><i>"And yet I can't even cry for her...and you know why?  Because I didn't really know her.  The woman who died...we were complete and total strangers.  I feel like we were just getting the chance to know each other, to really know each other, and it was just snatched away."</i></p>
<p><i>"And the thing you miss..."</i></p>
<p><i>"...is the woman I'll never know."</i></p>
<p><i>"It's okay, kid..."  Helena opened her arms, gently embracing Dinah under the clear sky of New Gotham.  "I understand..."  She whispered huskily, surprising herself with the emotion behind the words. "I understand."</i></p>
<p>Dinah slid easily into Helena's embrace...she felt like she had waited ages for this moment, ages for Helena to notice her, to meet her on equal ground...to let her into the inner circle.  Maybe ages was an exaggeration, she smiled to herself, but certainly from the first moment she had seen Helena in the alley, her first day in New Gotham.  Even then, despite the tough exterior and clear joy in the ass kicking business, Dinah had known that Helena had hidden a soft, gentle, heavily guarded heart, and Dinah had committed herself to penetrating those layers to know that heart, and love the woman who possessed it.  She stroked Helena's back in light circles with her fingertips, and laid her head on Helena's shoulder, letting herself both offer and receive comfort from the embrace.</p>
<p>Helena felt Dinah's fingertips drawing lazy circles between her shoulder blades, and tightened her embrace on the girl in her arms.  Closing her eyes, she inhaled deeply, taking in the scent of the blonde's long hair, which smelled both sweet and clean, like the air after a spring rain...not at all the cloyingly sweet flavored scent that permeated most women's beauty products; vanilla, strawberry, kiwi, melon...scents that Helena hated.  If she wanted to smell food, she would eat something.  Helena much preferred the earthy, natural smells such as juniper, eucalyptus, basil, sandalwood, aloe.  She inhaled deeply again, taking in the richness of Dinah's scent, a pleasantness that surprised her...she would have pegged Dinah as a vanilla-girl in more ways than just hair shampoo, but Helena was slowly finding out how wrong she was about the young woman.  And, the peculiar thing was that not only was Helena wrong about Dinah's lacking substance, but Dinah seemed to be bringing out a different side of her...a softer, less hostile at-war-with-the-whole-world side... a side that had talks about feelings, and invited hugs.  Helena smirked at herself, and what she would say if she had walked in on anyone else having a moment such as the one she was having with Dinah...a "hallmark" moment, she had always said with a sneer.  Hallmark moment or not, she found that she was enjoying the experience of holding and being held by Dinah...it was soft, and kind, and...something else.  Something instinctual, and primitive...something sexy.  </p>
<p>Dinah widened her eyes but then smiled knowingly as she felt Helena tighten the hug, and press her body closer in, felt Helena's leg pushing into hers, spreading them and settling gently between her thighs.  Helena's movements were strong yet gentle, guided not by force but curiosity...discovery.  Dinah could hear Helena's breath become heavier, longer as Helena pressed her nose into her hair and took in her scents.  Dinah closed her eyes, wanting to savor the moment, savor the experience of Helena's attentive study.  Even as she desired it, however, a part of her wanted it to stop...wanted to pull away and look into Helena's eyes and find the source of the brunette's sudden interest in her.  While she couldn't deny that she craved the knowledge of Helena'a touch, she also knew she didn't want whatever was happening to be just a fleeting moment of comfort between them.  Rather, a beginning.  Dinah was afraid of what would happen if this moment became more than a long embrace...afraid that it meant something different to her than it did to Helena.  And she knew she would not be able to handle Helena's cold distance or attempts to push her away once they had crossed this line.  As much as Dinah held a desire for the enigma that was Helena, she wanted whatever was between them to be about connection, about communication, and mutual respect and adoration.  If those things weren't there, she knew she had to stop whatever was on the verge of happening.  And with that in mind, she moved slightly out of the older woman's arms, bringing one hand around to rest between them on Helena's breastbone.</p>
<p>"Hel-"  She said softly, looking into the other woman's eyes.</p>
<p>Helena felt the younger woman stiffen in her arm, sensed a hesitation there.  "Shhhhh..."  she whispered, keeping one arm wrapped firmly around Dinah's thin frame and bringing the other around the cup the side of Dinah's face, stroking the fine hairs around her temple with her thumb.  "It's okay...you don't have to be afraid..."</p>
<p>"No...Helena..."  Dinah protested weakly, struggling to give voice to her thoughts but failing miserably as she gazed into the intense eyes of the other woman.  Helena's eyes were heavy and droopy with desire, her words hot and breathy on Dinah's face, sending shivers down the nape of her neck and into her spine.  </p>
<p>"Shhhh...I know..."  Helena whispered, leaning towards Dinah to plant a soft kiss on her forehead, then leaning back slightly to keep her eyes locked with hers.  She leaned in again, kissing the bridge of Dinah's nose, between her eyes.  "It's a big leap..."  she whispered, planting a kiss in one corner of Dinah's mouth.  "For me too, but I can be gentle..."  Helena kissed the other corner of Dinah's mouth.  "I can be so gentle for you..."  she whispered, finally landing a soft, light kiss on Dinah's lips.</p>
<p>"It isn't..."  Dinah breathed, trying to resist the intoxicating feeling of Helena's kisses all over her face, and the thrill of the older girl's words meant just for her.</p>
<p>"Dinah..."  Helena breathed, barely audible.  "Dinah..." she repeated, leaning in to kiss the younger woman again, meeting her lips with her own pouting mouth, parting them slightly with her tongue.  </p>
<p>Feeling Helena begin to deepen the kiss, Dinah was snapped back into reality, and stiffened quickly, leaning back away from Helena, who opened her eyes in surprise at Dinah's sudden retreat.</p>
<p>"Dinah...I meant it..."  Helena said, sounding confused, and more than a little surprised that someone was putting a halt to her ministrations.  Dinah wondered briefly if that had ever happened before.  "I know it's hard to trust me, but I'm not going to go all Huntress on you, and force you into anything here..."</p>
<p>Dinah smiled.  "I know..."  she said softly, but assuredly.</p>
<p>"You know?"  asked Helena, confused.  "If that's not it...then...."  she trailed off, her question hanging between them.  Slowly, her eyes widened, and Dinah could almost see the wheels turning in Helena's head as Helena struggled to come up with her own conclusions.  "Oh...OH!"  Said Helena, jumping back quickly from Dinah and nodding.  "Oh, God...I thought...I assumed...but if you're not...Christ!"  Helena muttered, suddenly starting to feel like quite the ass, a feeling she was definitely not used to. </p>
<p>Dinah watched Helena, trying to find a way to voice her feelings, and quickly, as Helena retreated from her and began to reinstate the walls of toughness she used as her defense mechanism.  </p>
<p>"NO!  No! That's not...NO!"  Dinah said firmly, reaching out to catch Helena by the wrist and pull her back into Dinah's space.  "My attraction to you isn't the issue here..."  Dinah said firmly, putting an end to any thoughts Helena was having on those lines. </p>
<p>Helena grinned.  "My God, kid, for a second there I thought I might be losing my touch."  she intoned, but then grew more serious.  "If that isn't it...my question still stands.  You want me, I know you do...and I want you...what's the holdup?"</p>
<p>"I...it's just..."  Dinah paused, taking a deep breath to keep from stammering and sounding like an idiot.  She wanted to get this right...she wanted to get Helena right, and knew she had to measure her words carefully.  "Why now?'' She asked, finally.</p>
<p>"What?"  questioned Helena, taken off guard by that question.  </p>
<p>"Why now?"  Dinah repeated.  "You're right when you say I want you.  I've wanted you since the first moment I met you, when you saved my ass in that alley.  You're the most amazing person I've ever met...you're tough, and you're smart, and you're funny, and you're strong, and you're unbelievably sexy, and all this time I've lived here with you and Barbara I've waited for you to see me, to really look at me and see me, because I knew that when you finally did that you would see how good we could be for each other..."  Dinah's voice wavered and cracked with the emotion behind her words as she struggled not to break down and cry in front of Helena.  </p>
<p>"Dinah..."  Helena said quietly, reaching up to stroke Dinah's cheek softly.</p>
<p>"Wait..."  Dinah said huskily.  "I'm not finished...you have to let me finish..."  She took a deep breath and sniffed.  "So now, here we are on the balcony, and there's the moon, and the cityscape of New Gotham, and you, standing there all beautiful and everything I've wanted, and despite how much I want you...want this...I'm scared.  I'm so scared I can't let myself have you until I know..."</p>
<p>"Know what, kid?"  Helena asked, her brows furrowing.</p>
<p>"Know why now."  Dinah said flatly.  "Why after all this time when you hardly noticed I existed, now you want me.  Because I'm afraid..."  Dinah trailed off, looking hard into Helena's eyes, unsure if she should really give voice to the thoughts inside her, the doubts she felt.</p>
<p>"...afraid...?"  Helena questioned, waiting for Dinah to finish.</p>
<p>"Afraid this is only happening now because I'm a member of the 'dead mothers' club."  Dinah whispered, hating how harsh her words sounded, hating that she might have gone too far and offended Helena, pushed her away.  That thought was the proverbial straw, and Dinah was unable to stop the tears from falling from her eyes, leaving quiet tracks down her face.  Dinah cried silently, watching Helena for the anger and rejection that was sure to come.  To Dinah's surprise though, Helena broke into a slow smile, and put her hands on Dinah's shoulders, squeezing them and shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Actually,"  Helena said, her voice swelling with affection and respect for the young blonde.  "It has nothing to do with that.  Actually, this is happening because I know you don't give a fuck about the 'dead mothers' club."  </p>
<p>"Wh..what?"  Dinah stammered through her tears, stunned at both the chipper attitude of the dark woman in front of her, and the casual way that she accepted and dealt head on with Dinah's fears.</p>
<p>"Listen to me..."  Helena said quietly but firmly, getting serious.  "You've dealt with...a lot in your life,"  she said, reaching out to stroke a small, white, v-shaped scar peeking out from beneath the strap of Dinah's tank top on her shoulder.  "More than I have really let myself pay attention to."  she continued.  "Your mom...the foster parents...the pain they caused you...You got big, you realized you wanted something different for yourself, you got on a bus and headed here with no money, no job...no security.  You dealt with your mom coming back...her death.  I've watched you all this time, Dinah, don't think I haven't noticed.  And every morning you get up smiling, and you bounce around this goddamn clocktower, and you're all eager to get into the life, and you don't let any of your shit hold you down.  When you first came I didn't know what all you had to carry...I just thought you were an overeager kid with no depth.  It was the cheerfulness.  I'm not one for cheerfulness."  Helena chuckled as Dinah listened, wide-eyed, to her words.  "But now, now I find that instead of having no substance...you have this inner strength...this courage.  You don't hide from your own pain, but you don't let it rule you either.  You live right in the present, and let the past be."  Helena softened her voice and glanced downward, noticing that she was holding Dinah's two hands in hers.</p>
<p>"I guess...I guess this is happening now because I respect you for those things.  And because a part of me...a SMALL part of me...wishes I could be just a little bit like that."</p>
<p>Dinah was amazed at the passion and the honesty with which Helena was talking to her.  No one, no one in Dinah's life had ever offered her that kind of acceptance and respect, or understood why she met life with the attitude she did.  She felt like Helena had somehow gained a passkey into her head, and she couldn't believe that she had finally met someone who didn't think she was crazy, or simple, or bad for her feelings.  She smiled broadly at Helena, even as her tears intensified.</p>
<p>"Jesus kid,"  Helena kidded her.  "I hope those are tears of joy, otherwise I think I might just have to pack it in... this talking shit out stuff doesn't suit me too well."</p>
<p>Dinah laughed out loud at Helena's kidding, and then narrowed her eyes, moving forward boldly into Helena's space.  She knew she was ready to take their heat to the next level.</p>
<p>"So you think I'm tough, huh?"  she breathed heavily, wrapping her arms around Helena's neck and pushing her hips into Helena's pelvis.  </p>
<p>Helena grinned widely at Dinah's confident swagger and suggestive tone.  This kid was full of surprises...just the way she liked it, she thought to herself.</p>
<p>"MMMMM, you're getting there."  Helena said with mock consideration, cocking her head and rolling her eyes upward in thought.  </p>
<p>"Good..."  whispered Dinah, oozing sexuality.  "Because you know you don't have to be gentle on my account." </p>
<p>Helena raised her eyebrows at Dinah, her lips curving upwards into a smirk.</p>
<p>"Oh no?"  She asked provocatively, gripping Dinah's hips and shoving her backwards into the wall of the balcony and inhaling her scent roughly, like an animal would when appraising its mate.</p>
<p>Dinah swung her leg around Helena's hip and let the momentum carry them both around until it was Helena whose back was against the wall and Dinah pressing into her hungrily, desire heavy in her gaze.  Helena knew she could resist Dinah's aggression at any time, but found herself incredibly turned on by the sudden shift in Dinah's manner.  "That's right, always surprising me, aren't you?"  Helena purred.</p>
<p>"You have no idea..."  Dinah got out, before crushing Helena's lips with her own, kissing her with the passion of months of pent up sexual desire.  Helena wound her hands in Dinah's long hair and returned the kiss with searing roughness, the two of them jockeying for the lead until at last the need for air overcame their arousal and they broke for a moment.</p>
<p>"You really think you can handle what I can bring?"  Helena panted, challenging Dinah playfully.</p>
<p>"I really think I want to find out."  Dinah breathed, before feeling Helena's lips cover her own in the first kiss of what promised to be a night of discovery for both of them.</p>
