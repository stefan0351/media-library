<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty -->

<p>Jane and Mike walked warily into the restaurant specified by Nicole on the phone when she had requested to meet with them. They both knew that the youngest Julian was up to no good and were worried about what that could mean. The fact that Nicole had a reputation for being rather diabolical in her schemes topped with the added knowledge that she'd tried to run Brooke down with her car the preceding spring made them both doubt that her intentions for meeting them were very honorable.</p>
<p>The maitre de led them to a private booth far in the back of the restaurant. Mike figured this was so that whatever plot Nicole was hatching wouldn't disturb or be disturbed by any fellow patrons. When they arrived at their assigned booth, they found Nicole, Mary Cherry, and Harrison waiting for them. The expressions on the three teens faces were serious and solemn, further increasing the adults alarm.</p>
<p>Jane and Mike took their seats and waited for someone to speak. Nicole cleared her throat, looked as contrite as she could manage and began.</p>
<p>"Mr. McQueen, Mrs. Soon-to-be-McQueen," she started gravely. "First, we'd like to thank you for having the open minds to meet with us. We understand that it must seem strange, being called to meet with your daughter's teenage friends. But we felt that the situation needed to be dealt with and in a timely manner. Since nothing we do seems to help matters, we were left with no other alternative but to come to you, their parents."</p>
<p>"Nicole, please cut the crap and tell us why we're here," Jane sighed. "You said it was something important having to do with Sam and Brooke."</p>
<p>"It is!" Mary Cherry broke in excitedly. "An y'all need tah know whutz bin goin' on behind y'all's backs!"</p>
<p>"We only have their best interests at heart," Nicole added quickly, shooting a deadly glare at Mary Cherry. Mary Cherry settled back in her seat with a chagrined look. Mike looked at Nicole doubtfully.</p>
<p>"'Best interests', huh? That's why you tried to run my daughter down last spring, right?" he asked sarcastically. Nicole flinched.</p>
<p>"And nearly killed both her AND Sam in the process?" Jane pointed out angrily. The night she'd almost lost both girls who meant the world to her was still a sore spot. She thanked God every day that neither had been hurt.</p>
<p>"That was a terrible, TERRIBLE error in judgment on my part," Nicole tried to explain quickly. "One for which I am VEY sorry. I was upset and shouldn't have been drinking. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"This is NOT why we're here," Harrison growled. All attention shifted to him.</p>
<p>"Why ARE you here, Harrison? You don't usually associate with these two," Jane said in confusion. Harrison's scowl grew darker.</p>
<p>"Actually, those I don't associate with would include people like Sam. Do you have ANY idea what she's done? What she's done to Brooke?" he began to rant and Nicole rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"What my hyper-emotional, testosterone fueled male counterpart is attempting to say," Nicole interrupted him in mid-breath before he could really get his mojo going. "Is that, well, perhaps it's easier to show you than to tell you." She whipped out three large plain manila envelopes, spreading them like playing cards across the table.</p>
<p>"After all," she smirked devilishly. "They say 'a picture is worth a thousand words.'" She opened the first envelope as if displaying evidence at a trial. Four full-page color glossy photos graced the table.</p>
<p>"Witness exhibit A," she said with a flourish. The first photo was of Sam and Brooke standing beside a park bench holding hands. Brooke's other hand was resting on Sam's hip while Sam's was caressing her face. Their eyes were locked in an intense gaze with one another and it was impossible to miss the level of emotion between them.</p>
<p>Mike and Jane looked at the photograph and then set it down, dutifully accepting the next one Nicole handed them. After they looked at those photos, Nicole opened the next envelope.</p>
<p>"It only gets worse from there," she sighed overdramatically. The next set of photos raised the stakes a little more. In those four there were more intimate touches, the girls were closer, and the emotions more intense. Jane and Mike were stone silent as they looked over this set as well.</p>
<p>"What's in the last envelope, Nicole?" Jane asked curtly, plainly annoyed. Thinking that she had finally sunk Princess Brooke and lowly Squire Sam, Nicole smiled in triumph.</p>
<p>"The final proof that your daughters have crossed the unseen line and become fodder for Jerry Springer," she gloated gleefully.</p>
<p>The last set of photos were nothing less than steamy, almost explicit in content. Sam and Brooke caught unaware in private, heated kisses and embraces. Some were obviously taken through a telephoto lens because it was apparent that the girls were safely within the Palace walls at the time.</p>
<p>Mike and Jane were very quiet as the moments stretched into minutes. Finally Harrison couldn't take it anymore.</p>
<p>"Well? What do you think about this? What are you going to do? Look what Sam's done to Brooke!" he rambled.</p>
<p>"Yes, what DO you think?" Nicole echoed, already picturing the devastation that was no doubt going to be done to Brooke and Sam.</p>
<p>Jane exchanged looks with Mike as they perused the pictures again. Then she pointed to one and smiled.</p>
<p>"I like this one the best," she said happily. "Don't you, dear?" Mike looked at it and nodded.</p>
<p>"Definitely," he agreed with a wide grin. "We should have it framed."</p>
<p>Nicole, Mary Cherry, and Harrison stared at the two parents in stunned shock before turning their group attention to the picture in question.</p>
<p>It showed Sam and Brooke walking arm in arm, again in the park. Brooke's face was nearly split in two by a huge grin and her eyes were dancing with was what obviously mirth and joy. Sam, meanwhile, was involved in what could only be described as a full-blown heartfelt belly laugh. It almost looked like Brooke was holding her up as she laughed uncontrollably, her head tilted back and her knees bent. It was a captured moment of pure, unadulterated bliss.</p>
<p>"They look so happy," Jane sighed.</p>
<p>"Yes, they do," Mike laughed, slipping the pictures back into their envelopes and into his lap while Nicole was too stunned to notice.</p>
<p>"Don't you see what's going on here?" Harrison screamed.</p>
<p>"Bring your voice down, Harrison," Mike ordered, leaning over the table slightly. "What I see, what WE see, are two people deeply in love with one another. We see two people blissfully happy having found each other. Why, what do you see?"</p>
<p>"Let's start with you, Mary Cherry. You've been preternaturally quiet," Jane said. "When you look at Sam and Brooke, what do YOU see?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry squirmed in her chair suddenly feeling as if she were under a huge spotlight in an interrogation room. Images of Mike in a militaristic outfit complete with faux mustache and Jane in a somewhat dominatrix-esque outfit momentarily clouded her mind until she was able to shake the vision free.</p>
<p>"Uhm?er?" she stuttered. "Ah see?two lez bee inz?"</p>
<p>"Don't' objectify them, Mary Cherry," Jane scolded like a good mother should. She put that one picture back in front of the floundering Southerner.</p>
<p>"Look again. What?do?you?see?" she repeated slowly. Mary Cherry gulped audibly and stared at the photo.</p>
<p>"Ah see?" she paused and took a long look at the picture. "Ah see Brookie and Spam?er?Sam," she corrected herself. She looked expectantly back at Jane and Mike like a puppy looking for praise.</p>
<p>"Very good, Mary Cherry," Mike said with a smile. "What else?" She sighed and looked back at the photo.</p>
<p>"Uhm, well?Ah see two young peoples?in luv," she admitted reluctantly.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry!" Nicole hissed. Mary Cherry glared at her.</p>
<p>"Well, Ah do! Come on, Nic, how cin y'all ignore wuz between Brookie and Sam? Ah mean, sure, 'cordin' tah Gawd their goin' tah Hell an' all, but they look so gursh dern happy, y'all!"</p>
<p>"Whose side are you on, you traitor?" Harrison barked.</p>
<p>"On th' side o' true luuuuuv," Mary Cherry said wistfully. Her eyes then narrowed. "An' not on th' same side as a ignorant lil' homophobe like you, Joe. It's people like y'all that give rednecks a bad name," she huffed. She then turned to Nicole.</p>
<p>"Ah nevah did like whut y'all wuz tryin' tah do tah Brookie but Ah wuz too scared tah say anythin'. Now, Ah'm not. Y'all are evil, Nic. EEEEEEE-Vil," she drawled, wagging a finger at her petite mastermind in shame. Nicole shrugged.</p>
<p>"Whatever," she said boredly. "Turncoat."</p>
<p>"What about you, Nicole? What's your opinion?" Mike asked. Nicole turned her ice blue stare on the McQueen/McPherson parentals and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I see two girls sacrificing everything for something as petty and fleeting as the illusion of love. There's no such thing as love, let alone true love. It's a myth perpetuated by the gift card industry designed to sell sentimental crap and chocolate at designated times of the year and to remind us of how alone and pathetic our lives really are."</p>
<p>"Brooke has it all; looks, money, popularity. Most people would kill to have half of what she keeps without trying and she doesn't even fucking want it! But she's going to throw it all down the crapper, and for what? Samantha McPherson? Please, Spam McFearsome is nothing, HAS nothing. She isn't worth the spit it would take to shine my leather boots."</p>
<p>"So what do I see when I look at those two losers?" she asked, her voice chock full of bitterness and contempt. "I see stupidity at it's finest. I see a girl with everything throwing it all away for nothing. Love is worthless! They're not happy, they're delusional!" she concluded. Jane shook her head.</p>
<p>"Someone sounds jealous," she said quietly. Nicole's eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>"Of THOSE two? NEVER! They've got nothing for me to be jealous of. A lifetime of hatred, bigotry, ignorance, and prejudice? Gee, no thanks," she snorted. "Because that's what it boils down to. THAT'S what I see in store for them. THAT'S what I see." She crossed her arms in front of her and looked satisfied with herself. The Law and Gospel According to Nicole Julian.</p>
<p>"You must be a very lonely little girl," Mike said sadly. "Because you're certainly going to be a very sad and lonely young woman."</p>
<p>"Whatever. Loneliness would imply that I give a damn. I don't," Nicole stated simply. "Besides, I'd rather be 'lonely' and popular, than ridiculed and forgotten."</p>
<p>"Oh, Nicole," Jane sighed. "When did your heart turn so cold?"</p>
<p>"Sometime immediately following birth," Nicole retorted seemingly unflinching.</p>
<p>"Excuse me? We're not here to discuss Nicole's lack of humanity. We're here to talk about what Sam has turned Brooke into," Harrison pointed out snottily. Mike turned to him.</p>
<p>"And exactly what would that be? Besides a well adjusted, strong-willed, responsible, and loving individual instead of a heartless harpy like Nicole here?" he challenged the young teen. Harrison's face turned stony.</p>
<p>"She's taken Brooke, a perfectly normal young girl and turned her into a God damn lesbian!" he shouted enraged. "Here she was, happily dating me and barely even friends with Sam until the accident. Then poor Brooke wakes up with no memory of who she is, or who any of us is or what the boundaries are. And Sam takes advantage of that to warp and twist her into who SHE wants Brooke to be; so she can get what SHE wants from Brooke. It's sick. She turned Brooke's need and dependency on her into a perverted sense of love."</p>
<p>"Harrison?" Jane tried to interrupt but the irate teen ignored her.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke is not gay! She can't BE gay. She slept with Josh. She slept with me! Gay women do not sleep with men, that would make them straight," he announced as if that solved everything. The Law and Gospel According to Harrison John.</p>
<p>"Or bi, or experimenting, or in denial," Mary Cherry added sneakily. "Or mahbe, aftah you, Joe, she couldn' stand th' thought o' anothah man evah touchin' her again. Mahbe YOU turned her an' not lil' ol' Sammy." Harrison roared and lunged at Mary Cherry, wrapping his hands around her throat as she scrambled to get away. A few exaggerated choking sounds escaped her as Mike pried Harrison off her neck. Mike had to practically sit on Harrison to hold him still.</p>
<p>"LIAR," he spat at the recovering Mary Cherry. He turned back to the adults. "You can't let Sam get away with this! Brooke doesn't love her! She doesn't belong with her!" he raved.</p>
<p>"Harrison," Jane said gently. "Yes, she does. On both counts." Harrison's eyes grew wide and his jaw dropped open.</p>
<p>"How can you SAY that? How can you be so calm knowing what Sam's done?" he asked pitifully desperate. Jane exchanged looks with Mike.</p>
<p>"Harrison," Mike began slowly hoping the boy would understand. "We both noticed something, a growing bond between the girls long before the accident. Even I, a man, saw the unspoken love and attraction that was there and neither girl would acknowledge for a long time. I also remember the day that I noticed something in Sam had changed. It was sometime after her and her mother had moved in. She was sullen for so long and then it was like the cloud lifted. I watched her for a while and I realized that she's accepted how she felt about Brooke and the fact that as far as she knew, Brooke would never return those feelings?"</p>
<p>"Exactly my point!" Harrison interrupted. "Brooke, as she was, never would." Mike shook his head.</p>
<p>"You didn't let me finish. I saw the change in Sam, the peace that seemed to come over her and I was proud of her. But it made me sad because I watched my own daughter, Brooke, fight with the same demons. I saw her deny herself her happiness out of fear and social training even though how she felt for Sam was as plain as day."</p>
<p>"She was never happy dating Josh, but I thought maybe it was something else. And then I saw how unhappy she was dating you, Harrison, and I realized that it wasn't. It was because she loved Sam. With or without the accident, your relationship was never going to work," Mike said harshly. "And after the accident I saw the way Brooke naturally gravitated towards Sam. While she pushed everyone else away, she held on to Sam. That wasn't Sam's doing, it was Brooke's. Sam didn't push Brooke into anything. It's what Brooke wanted, of that, I have no doubt. That accident, that damn accident that took everything else and nearly killed her, also made Brooke forget what she was so afraid of. It freed her, Harrison, to be herself."</p>
<p>Everyone was silent after Mike finished his heartfelt speech. Jane and Mary Cherry dabbed away a few tears while Nicole looked disinterested and Harrison seethed.</p>
<p>"So you're not going to do anything to stop it?" Harrison ground out through his teeth minutes later. Jane and Mike shook their heads.</p>
<p>"No, as a matter of fact, as soon as we discuss a few things with the girls, certain rules concerning their conduct, just for our sakes," Jane said evenly. "We have every intention of supporting them."</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Harrison yelled.</p>
<p>"Rules? What sort of rules?" Nicole asked, her curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>"Oh, you know, the usual. Be safe, use protection, no eloping?that sort of thing," Mike taunted with a smirk. Nicole slouched back down in her seat defeated. That wasn't what she wanted to hear.</p>
<p>"You condone what Sam's done? How could you?" Harrison asked outraged.</p>
<p>"Harrison, why do you have this NEED to blame Sam?" Jane asked him. "Brooke loves her and she loves Brooke. They make each other happy. Why is that so hard for you?"</p>
<p>"Because it's not right!" Harrison argued.</p>
<p>"You'd think someone who's own mother is gay would be more accepting," Mike said off-handed. Harrison leapt to his feet.</p>
<p>"Why does everyone have to drag my mother into this? That has nothing to do with it. She's an adult and can make her own mistakes. Brooke is brain damaged and needs to be protected," he said in his last ditch effort to win his argument. </p>
<p>"No, she's not. Her scans show no permanent brain damage. You know that, Harrison," Jane pointed out. "Stop trying to pawn her choosing Sam over you on that or Sam 'brainwashing' her. You lost, Harrison. Accept it."</p>
<p>With a stomp and a growl reminiscent of a four-year-olds temper tantrum, Harrison left the restaurant. After a healthy pause, Nicole stood up, smoothed her hands down her pants suit lifting a few imaginary strands of lint off of herself as she went, and turned to leave.</p>
<p>"Nicole, just so you know, using their relationship to try and destroy them isn't going to work," Mike said flatly. "You'd think that you would have learned by now?" Nicole put one hand up to stop him.</p>
<p>"OK, I didn't sign on for the 'Father Knows Best' speech so, shelve it. If I want to hear tired little platitudes about 'finding my own happiness' or some equally banal shit, I'll read a chinsey refrigerator magnet," she snapped.</p>
<p>"Nicole, as a mother of two daughters and a step daughter, I hate to see such a lovely young lady with such potential squander her opportunities trying to hurt other people," Jane said softly. "But," her eyes turned cold and dangerous.</p>
<p>"As that same mother of the same two girls whose lives you continually try to destroy, let me give you this one warning: If you do anything more to get in their way, do anything more to ruin or put a damper on their happiness?I'll bury you."</p>
