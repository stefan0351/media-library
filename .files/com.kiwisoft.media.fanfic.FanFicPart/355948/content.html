<!-- What Ever Happened To \ Part Four -->

<p>Whitney entered the hotel lobby. She enjoyed her time with her parents. During her visit she managed to convince herself that she hadn't made an ass out of herself when she saw Holly earlier. She looked so different with her shorter hair and confident stride.</p>
		<p>Still feeling wide awake from the pot of coffee she'd consumed at her mother's, she decided to have a nightcap. As she stepped into the bar, she was greeted by the sound of laughter. She quickly found the source. The bar was empty with the exception of a group of people hovering around the far end.</p>
		<p>Her mouth went dry as she spotted a very familiar set of emerald eyes staring back at her. She thought about turning around and heading up to her room. But then Holly flashed her a friendly smile. <i>'A nightcap, ' </i>she thought to herself. <i>'And perhaps a bucket of ice, ' </i>she added as her eyes drifted over Holly's well-toned body.</p>
		<p>Still feeling slightly shy, Whitney seated herself at the bar away from the crowd. She ordered a glass of white zinfandel and sipped it silently while she stole glances at the group off to her right. She felt alone. She recognized most of their faces. But with the exception of Freddie, she really didn't know any of them. A pang struck her as she suddenly missed Kenny. <i>'Perhaps coming back wasn't such a good idea. ' </i>She sighed deeply.</p>
		<p>She was also feeling like a voyeur, watching Holly's smile out of the corner of her eye. Freddie kept whispering to her. She kept pushing him away and blushing. <i>'Well, that answers that, doesn't it? ' </i>Whitney kicked herself mentally for even looking at the blonde. <i>'Still, it doesn't make sense, ' </i>she contemplated. <i>'Freddie is happily married. In fact, his wife is standing next to him. Julie doesn't seem bothered by his actions. Maybe they're into that kind of thing? Yuck! ' </i>She grimaced at the unpleasant image that popped into her mind. <i>'Still, my radar went off the scale when I saw her earlier. I wonder? ' </i>Whitney pondered the possibilities, some in very interesting detail.</p>
		<p>A tap on her shoulder roused her from her thoughts just as they were getting interesting. She blushed as she turned to find Freddie standing next to her. "Hi, Whitney," the dark-haired mild-mannered man addressed her.</p>
		<p>"Hello, Freddie," she responded warmly. "Good to see you again."</p>
		<p>"Glad to see you could make it," he continued. "Been to the old neighborhood yet?"</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah." She nodded in response. "I've just come from having dinner with my parents."</p>
		<p>"How are Mr. And Mrs. Staverson?" Freddie inquired.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe that you're a grown man and still call them that," she teased.</p>
		<p>"Habit." Freddie smiled. "I just couldn't see myself calling them . . . you know, I don't think I know your parents' first names."</p>
		<p>"Mom and Dad," she said flatly. "Sorry, I couldn't resist."</p>
		<p>"Why don't you join us?" he suggested.</p>
		<p>"I . . . uhm . . . ," she stammered as her heart raced. "I wouldn't want to intrude," she finally managed to squeak out.</p>
		<p>"Nonsense," he encouraged her. "It's a reunion. Come on."</p>
		<p>Still feeling apprehensive, she nodded in agreement and followed him over. She managed to exchange hellos with everyone without making a fool of herself. She knew Joan who'd been close to Holly and Selma. She noticed that Selma was missing. She also noticed that Bobby Ransfort, who had been Holly's steady all through high school, was among the missing. There were a few other faces missing as well. Whitney wondered about that. They all had been a pretty tight group back in the old days.</p>
		<p>"Where's Selma?" she finally inquired. "I wouldn't think that she'd miss out on this get together."</p>
		<p>"She wasn't up for it." Joan pouted. "She seemed kind of tired when I talked to her earlier. I hope she's alright," she added.</p>
		<p>"She seemed fine at lunch today," Holly volunteered quickly. "I mean . . . " Whitney noticed the blonde's discomfort. ". . .she's just been real busy with classes and organizing the reunion."</p>
		<p>Whitney looked at Holly curiously as she thought, <i>'You're lucky I don't have you on the witness stand. You're a terrible liar. ' </i>Whitney smiled as the small blonde tucked her hair behind her ear in a nervous manner. "You know guys . . . , " Holly said suddenly in a thoughtful tone, ". . . I can't help but notice a few gaps in our little group."</p>
		<p>Whitney noticed as everyone, even the spouses of her old classmates, began to avert their eyes and shift uncomfortably. "I see," Holly said dryly. "Thank you, Joanie. I appreciate this." The blonde's eyes became slightly misty as her voice lowered.</p>
		<p>"Ah fuck ?em," Joan announced boldly, startling the bartender in the process. "Those idiots were never any fun."</p>
		<p>"That's my shrinking violet," Joan's husband said proudly as he kissed his wife on the cheek.</p>
		<p>"Well, they weren't," Joan reasserted. "We love you, Holly."</p>
		<p>The others toasted in agreement. Whitney smiled at the sight, still not fully understanding just what was happening. But if it made Holly smile like that then it was most definitely a good thing. "Thanks guys." Holly blushed as she spoke. "Sorry, Whitney." Holly smiled over at her. "It's just that some of my old friends turned out not to be my friends," she explained with a hint of sadness.</p>
		<p>"Well, now that's out in the open," Joan declared, "there is something we all have been waiting years to tell you, Holly."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh?" Holly responded tentatively.</p>
		<p>"We never liked Bobby," Joan announced boldly.</p>
		<p>Whitney watched in amusement as Holly simply blinked in amazement. "Personally, I hated the guy," Freddie said.</p>
		<p>"Never understood what you saw in him," Trisha added. "I mean, he was practically stalking you from the time you guys were in diapers."</p>
		<p>"Honestly, the guy was a jerk," Rex tossed in.</p>
		<p>"Now you tell me," Holly said sarcastically. "Back in high school Selma was the only one to tell me."</p>
		<p>"Well, that was Selma," Joan pointed out. "She's the only one who could have gotten away with it. Of course, none of us thought you would last that long with him. Who knew you'd date him for both junior and senior years?"</p>
		<p>"I didn't know what I wanted back then," Holly explained. Whitney couldn't help notice that the comment was directed towards her. "So who did he end up marrying?" Holly added.</p>
		<p>"Colleen," Joan informed her with a smile.</p>
		<p>"I knew it." Holly laughed. "She was always all over him like white on rice. I hope they're very happy together." She chuckled.</p>
		<p>Joan shot her a look of disbelief. "It's true," Holly defended herself. "I don't want him. I never really did. And if they're happy, it keeps him away from me. Enough of this," Holly stated firmly. "I really don't want to talk about him. It's bad enough he'll be here tomorrow. The guy is not stable."</p>
		<p>Whitney's senses went on full alert upon hearing this statement. "So what's everyone up to these days?" she inquired in order to change the subject. Thankfully the others picked up on her cue. They continued to chat until the bartender announced that it was closing time. Everyone moaned and complained, with the exception of Trisha and Rex who were locked in a deep conversation.</p>
		<p>The rest of them shuffled back into the lobby, some leaving the hotel and the others making their way to the elevator. Whitney chose to linger behind so she could walk with Holly. They joined the others in the crowded elevator. Their arms and thighs brushed against one another. Whitney was thankful to discover that they would be the last stop and they would be alone for at least two floors. Well, thankful and silently nervous.</p>
		<p>"So if you don't mind me asking . . . ," Whitney began carefully once they were alone. She almost forgot what she was going to say when she looked into Holly's eyes. " . . . what happened with Bobby?" she finally managed to say.</p>
		<p>"Well, let's see." Holly stepped slightly closer. Whitney's heart pounded against her chest. "First, I broke up with him right before I left for college. He smashed my car windshield. My mother asked what I did to upset him."</p>
		<p>"Excuse me?" Whitney flared.</p>
		<p>"I know. I never expected that," Holly responded. "My dad told me I was better off without him. Then Bobby tried to win me back. I refused and went off to college. Bobby kept showing up there. Finally I told him I was gay. He didn't take it very well. He never tried to hurt me but I ended up calling campus security and having him barred from the campus. He told my parents about me."</p>
		<p>"Nice guy," Whitney groaned.</p>
		<p>"They didn't take it well either," Holly explained. "By the time I graduated, we weren't speaking. Still don't. Of course, for years Bobby sent me nasty letters."</p>
		<p>"Charming," Whitney muttered as the elevator doors opened. "I'm sorry about your parents," she offered sincerely as they made their way down the corridor.</p>
		<p>"How about your parents?" Holly inquired tentatively. </p>
		<p>Whitney smiled at the question. "They weren't surprised in the least. My real dad is gay so it wasn't foreign territory. My coming out really helped Kenny with his parents." Whitney felt another tug on her heartstrings as she stopped in front of her door.</p>
		<p>"I heard," Holly whispered softly. "Freddie told us. I'm sorry." </p>
		<p>Holly touched her arm gently. Whitney felt the sadness rush out of her as the smaller woman caressed her arm. "Thank you," Whitney whispered in response. They lingered outside her door as Whitney tried to think of something to say. She didn't want to say goodnight to Holly just yet.</p>
		<p>"We're neighbors," Holly said lightly, her hand still resting on Whitney's forearm. "I'm in the next room," she explained as she motioned with her head.</p>
		<p>"Well then." Whitney licked her lips as she drank in the sight of Holly's exposed neck. "I should walk you home then. It is rather late." Whitney's body practically hummed from their nearness. "Or if you want . . . to come in for awhile," Whitney suggested.</p>
		<p>"Yes," Holly answered softly.</p>
