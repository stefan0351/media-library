<!-- Hello Satan, Got Time For A Smoke? -->


<p>San knocked nervously on the door.  She didn't really
understand why she was here, she just was.  The door opened to reveal
a rather stuffy looking butler, a gentleman in his sixties.  He
glanced down at her for a moment before recognition set in.</p>

<p>"Ms. McPherson, I presume?" he asked.  &lt;People actually talk
like that?&gt; She nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, is Satan, I mean Nicole home?" the butler rolled his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Satan was a much more accurate description," he said dryly
in a British accent.  Sam tried unsuccessfully to hide a smile. "But
yes, I'll get her for you."</p>

<p>Sam waited outside the handicapped inaccessible door until
Nicole poked her surprised head out the door.  She glanced at Sam in
shock and then stepped out the door and shut it behind her.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe the somewhat dubious honor?" Nic asked
nervously, although she tried to hide the discomfort in disinterest.
Her eyes suddenly widened.  "You don't have a gun, do you?" Sam
laughed, actually laughed at this.</p>

<p>"Not this time, but it's something to keep in mind for next
time.  No, I wanted to talk to you."</p>

<p>"Oh," Nicole said as she sat down on the step next to Sam,
which surprised Sam, Nicole sitting down on the dirty step.
Shrugging it off, Sam continued.</p>

<p>"I'm alive, no thanks to you and your questionable driving
skills," she started.  She noticed Nicole was staring at the ground.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," Nic said softly.  Sam stared at her in shock.</p>

<p>"What?" Nicole looked up at her and Sam was floored to see
tears in Nic's eyes.</p>

<p>"Jesus, Sam, I never set out to hurt anyone.  I was drunk and
angry.  I would never hurt Brooke, never in a million years.  And I'm
sorry for what I did.  As much as I might resent you, I wouldn't want
to hurt you either.  I am not a cold-blooded killer.  I really wish
people would stop making me out to be," she whispered hotly as tears
fell unchecked to the ground beneath her.</p>

<p>"Who are you and what have you done with the real Nicole
Julian?" Sam asked getting a watery smile from the girl beside her.</p>

<p>"That's just it, Sam.  I AM the real Nicole Julian.  The girl
you go to high school with, that's just an act, a cover so that no
one can get to me, hurt me.  I don't let anyone close to me so I can
never get hurt." Sam was seeing Nic in a whole new light.  And what
was frightening was the fact that they were eerily similar.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because when I get hurt, I lash out, Sam.  God, look at
you.  Isn't that proof enough?  I nearly killed you and Brooke
because I didn't get my own way and I got my feelings hurt.  But it
also made me see that if I keep living this way, not feeling, I'm
going to hurt those around me.  I really am sorry for everything.
And if there was anything I could do to make this up to you and
Brooke, I would."</p>

<p>"How did you get away with it?" Sam asked.  Nicole shrugged.</p>

<p>"Wasn't my idea, but my family wanted to save face.  They
pulled a lot of strings and called in some favors.  Whatever, I was
ready to take my punishment but my family took that from me.  I'm
sorry for that too." Sam shrugged.  God, help her, she actually
believed and sympathized with Nicole Julian.  And worse, actually
liked the real person sitting there next to her.</p>

<p>"I have a few ideas how you might be able to help me and
Brooke, eventually," Nicole's eyes lit up at this.  "You might not
like it but, it'll be a while before I call in the marker, OK?" Nic
nodded.  "But first, got any plans for the day after tomorrow?"</p>
