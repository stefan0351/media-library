<p style="text-align:center;"><B>4</B></P><P>Back in the cabin, Lilly lay silent in her bunk, listening to Miley toss and turn below her. As comfortable as her pillow was, she knew she wouldn't get any sleep at all if Miley kept up her movement. Sighing, she slid her pillow out from under her head and chucked it down below. She knew it found its mark when she heard a muffled "oof!" from the lower bunk.</P><P>Miley pulled the pillow off her face, placing it under her head. She reached up a hand, pushing on the mattress above her that peeked through the wooden slats. A few seconds later, Lilly's head appeared over the edge.</P><P>"What?" she whispered.</P><P>"What are you gonna sleep on?" Miley asked quietly.</P><P>"I don't need a pillow," Lilly replied, sliding back up and pulling the covers to her chin. "'Night, Miley."</P><P>Miley remained silent, but Lilly knew she was grateful. And as uncomfortable as sleeping without a pillow was, she somehow managed it anyway.</P><P>Lilly Truscott was dreaming. She was in jail, an innocent woman, and until she had met her cellmate, there had been no hope. But now they were tunneling and freedom was only a few feet away. She could feel her cellmate tugging at her, urging her forward.</P><P>"I'm coming, I'm coming," mumbled Lilly.</P><P>"Shh." Miley's white face loomed over her in the darkened cabin. "They're all asleep," she whispered, her breath tickling Lilly's ear and making Lilly's heart rate spike. "Let's go."</P><P>Lilly let herself down from the upper bunk and silently struggled into her clothes. "What time is it?" she whispered.</P><P>"A little after five," Miley whispered back. "It'll be daylight by the time we reach the mainland. Hurry up."</P><P>The two girls tiptoed across the room and let themselves out of Cabin 13, taking great care to shut the door noiselessly behind them. They raced through the darkness to the waterfront and the dock.</P><P>"Look," said Lilly nervously as Miley selected a small motorboat, "are you sure about this? I heard someone say you can't swim."</P><P>"Of course I can swim," said Miley, her poker face expressing nothing. She paused.  "What about you? Can you swim?"</P><P>"Sure. I wouldn't set foot in a boat if I couldn't. Anyway, here's two life jackets."</P><P>Miley and Lilly quickly donned the jackets and hopped into the boat. Miley cast off from the dock and gave a mighty heave on the starter cord. The small outboard motor turned over and roared into life. Miley cast Lilly a look of triumph as the small boat pulled away from the dock and headed towards open water.</P><P>"How long do you think it'll take to get to the mainland?" shouted Lilly over the engine noise. She cast a nervous eye back towards the sleeping island.</P><P>"Maybe ten or fifteen minutes," Miley called back. "It's clear sailing from here on in."</P><P>The sky was just beginning to show the first streaks of dawn and the little outboard motor was about halfway to the mainland when Miley and Lilly first spotted the big Coast Guard cruiser. It shone a spotlight on them and then pulled alongside the small craft. An officer appeared and gazed down at the two girls.</P><P>"Hi," he said by way of greeting. "Where are you ladies going at this hour of the morning?"</P><P>"The mainland, sir," said Miley.</P><P>"Are you from Algonkian?" asked the officer.</P><P>"Yes, sir," chorused the two girls.</P><P>"Well, now, let's check out your gear. Life jackets on correctly?...Yup. Extra gas can?...Yup. Emergency oars?...Yup. Bailing bucket?...What? No bailing bucket? Where's your bailing bucket?"</P><P>There was a long silence. "Darn it," Miley said mildly, "we must have forgotten."</P><P>"No bailing bucket?" repeated the officer. "You just turn that rig around and go right back to camp. And don't come out again without a bailing bucket."</P><P>Obediently Miley turned the boat around and headed back towards Algonkian Island.</P><P>"We got away with everything," said Lilly bitterly, "and we forgot the bailing bucket!"</P><P>"No bailing bucket," repeated Miley, half to herself.</P><P>With the patrol boat still in the area, Miley piloted the outboard back to the Algonkian dock and moored it there.</P><P>"Come on," she said to Lilly. "Back to our cell."</P><P>"That was <I>awful</I>," breathed Lilly.</P><P>"Oh well," Miley shrugged, the image of Alcatraz Island strong on her mind. "At least we weren't fired on. And tomorrow's another day."</P><P>The two girls crossed the compound to Cabin 13 and let themselves in. Everyone was still asleep.</P><P>Miley reached into her duffle bag, pulled out her chalk and drew another line on the cabin wall.</P><P>"Three," she counted.</P><P>"Well, Stewart," said Trina over breakfast that morning, "are you and Truscott going to join our volleyball game today?"</P><P>"Gee, no," said Miley blandly. "We're really more interested in arts and crafts."</P><P>"Yes, I thought so," said Trina cunningly. "Today before lunch I want to see that there <I>salet</I><I>é</I> you're working on."</P><P>Lilly turned deathly white.</P><P>"Certainly," said Miley. "It should be ready by then. Right, Lilly?"</P><P>"If we hurry," agreed Lilly in a strangled voice.</P><P>"Great," said Trina. "I'm really looking forward to seeing what keeps you glued to arts and crafts."</P><P>"As long as it keeps Stewart away from us, it's fine!" said Ashley viciously.</P><P>Miley stared at her pityingly.</P><P>"All right, ladies," bellowed Trina. "Out to the volleyball court. Stewart, Truscott, I'll see you <I>and</I> your <I>salet</I><I>é</I> here at lunch."</P><P>She jogged off at the head of her troop.</P><P>"Now what are we going to do?" asked Lilly miserably as she and Miley walked into the empty cabin. "Trina wants to see our <I>salet</I><I>é</I>. We haven't got a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>. There's no such thing as a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>!"</P><P>"Yes, there is," said Miley. "I told you it means dirt."</P><P>"Well, how are we going to produce a <I>salet</I><I>é</I> by lunchtime?"</P><P>"Shouldn't be too difficult," said Miley. "There's plenty of dirt around." A sweep of her arm indicated her general surroundings.</P><P>"Yeah," agreed Lilly. "But Trina expects some sort of art thing."</P><P>"What our resident clone expects is not important," said Miley. "<I>Salet</I><I>é</I> means dirt, and that's what she's getting."</P><P>"A bag of dirt?" asked Lilly incredulously.</P><P>"Certainly not," said Miley indignantly. "That would be cheap. We'll give her the dirt in a properly-made wooden box."</P><P>"Do they have wood at arts and crafts?" asked Lilly.</P><P>"Probably," replied Miley. "But it doesn't matter. We're not using that wood anyway." She rubbed her hands together with glee and almost smiled. "We're going to use the wooden slats that support Ashley's mattress."</P><P>Lilly gasped. "You wouldn't!"</P><P>"Yes I would," said Miley.</P><P>"Her Cloneship will love this," mumbled Miley, her mouth full of nails.</P><P>Lilly secured the last hinge on the lid of the box. "Should we paint it?"</P><P>"It would look nicer," said Miley, taking the nails from her mouth and putting them down on the table. "I see it sky-blue—symbolic, you know? The sky on the outside and the earth on the inside."</P><P>"I'll get the paint," laughed Lilly.</P><P>"Tomorrow," Miley said thoughtfully as they carefully daubed pale blue paint onto their creation, "we'll go earlier, and we'll take a sailboat to make sure we're not hear by any patrols."</P><P>"And a bailing bucket," added Lilly. "Don't forget the bailing bucket."</P><P>"It was uppermost in my mind," said Miley.</P><P>"How long will it take for this paint to dry?" asked Lilly, leaning back to admire their handiwork.</P><P>"The jar said half an hour," Miley replied. "Let's put it out in the sun to speed it up. It's almost lunch time, and we still have to fill it."</P><P>"How long will that take? There's dirt all over the compound."</P><P>"For a superior <I>salet</I><I>é</I> one must use superior dirt," explained Miley.</P><P>"I wonder what she'll say when we give it to her."</P><P>"Oh, that's easy. She'll say '<I>Stewart!'</I> Or she just may say nothing at all. Overcome, you see?" Miley glanced at her watch. "We'll soon find out."</P><P>Chantel, the arts and crafts counselor, strolled over to inspect their work.</P><P>"That's a nice, neat job," she observed. "Well sanded."</P><P>"Thanks," said Lilly.</P><P>"We used only the best wood," put in Miley. "Aged and stress-tested."</P><P>"Stress-tested?" Chantel repeated. "For a little box like that? What are you planning to put in it?"</P><P>"Dirt," said Miley.  "It's a present for our counselor."</P><P>Chantel stared at her.  "Tell me," she said finally, "by any chance would your name be Stewart?"</P><P>"Why, yes," said Miley, coming perilously close to smiling. Trina had obviously been dropping her name at the counselors' meetings. This pleased her immensely.</P><P>"Come on," urged Lilly. "It's as dry as it's going to get. Let's—uh—finish it up and go for lunch."</P><P>"It was great meeting you," said Chantel dubiously. "I'm glad you enjoy arts and crafts."</P><P>"'Bye," said Lilly.</P><P>The two girls left the arts and crafts cabin in search of superior dirt.</P><P>Trina rubbed her hands together with great glee. "Stewart and Truscott are late for lunch," she gloated, looking around the mess hall. "I've got them now. They're going to have to admit they weren't in arts and crafts yesterday and they didn't build a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>."  She smiled. She was going to put them on work detail for the rest of their miserable lives.</P><P>"Well," said Ashley sarcastically, "where are our two artists?"</P><P>"Shut up, Ashley," said Trina absently. "They'll be here."</P><P>"Hey, look, Trina," called Sarah from the end of the table. "Here they come."</P><P>Into the mess hall came Miley and Lilly, proudly bearing their <I>salet</I><I>é</I> on a pillow. They threaded their way through the other tables, walked up to table 13, and held out the small blue box for Trina's inspection.</P><P>"Here it is," said Miley, "The <I>salet</I><I>é</I>."</P><P>Trina was dumbfounded.  They had actually done it. They had actually built a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>.  She lifted the lid and looked inside. Dirt. It looked like dirt.  Some topsoil, some clay, a few stones and the odd blade of grass.  Dirt. She ran her fingers through it. Dirt. This couldn't be a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>. She had looked it up this morning in the dictionary and had been unable to find it, but whatever it was, this couldn't be it.</P><P>She looked up at Lilly.  The girl's face was bright red. Her eyes turned towards Miley, whose expression was inscrutable, as usual. "Stewart—" she began softly, threateningly.</P><P>Miley's eyes displayed deep pain. "Don't you like it?"</P><P>"It's—it's—very interesting," stammered Trina.</P><P>"I think it stinks," piped up Ashley.</P><P>"That's because you have no soul," explained Miley pleasantly.</P><P>"I'll bet that's my pillow, too," accused Ashley.</P><P>"Ah, you recognized it," said Miley. "Very good."</P><P>"All right, you guys," shouted Trina. "Grab some lunch. This afternoon we're <I>all</I> playing field hockey." She smiled maliciously at Miley.  "Since you've already finished the <I>salet</I><I>é</I>, you and Truscott will play too."</P><P>"I don't play field hockey," said Miley.</P><P>"Why not?" demanded Trina.</P><P>"I'm a pacifist," said Miley. "Hockey is far too violent for me. Besides, Lilly and I decided we'd spend the afternoon playing chess."</P><P>"Chess?" howled Trina. "<I>Chess?</I> At camp? With all the marvelous things to do around here, you two want to play <I>chess?</I> What do you say, Truscott?"</P><P>"Chess is—fun," said Lilly lamely.</P><P>"It sure is," said Miley enthusiastically. "And having fun is what camp is all about. You said so yourself, Trina."</P><P>"Oh, let them play chess!" exclaimed Ashley impatiently. "At least we'll be rid of them."</P><P>"Shut up, Ashley!" snapped Trina. After three days that answer was becoming a conditioned reflex. She turned to Miley and Lilly. "All right. Just for today. But tomorrow you're joining the baseball team like everybody else."</P><P>Miley looked significantly towards Lilly. If all went well, there wouldn't be a tomorrow.</P><P>"I think she took it rather well," said Miley, castling her king into safety. "After all, it's not every day a clone is presented with a box of high-grade dirt."</P><P>Lilly pushed her king's rook pawn. "She's not such a bad chick, you know."</P><P>"Agreed," said Miley. "She just happens to be in the wrong place—in my way. I'm afraid she'll have to take her lumps as I dish them out."</P><P>The two exchanged queens. "Maybe," suggested Lilly timidly, "we could just get kicked out instead of running away. You know, be real bad and stuff. If enough counselors complain, the Warden will pack us off home."</P><P>"Ha!" said Miley scornfully. "They'd never toss us out of here. To them we're money in the bank. Haven't you noticed with our clone? No matter what I do she comes up smiling. We could no more get kicked out of here than you could win this game."</P><P>"I'm not losing."  Lilly moved her knight defensively.</P><P>"Yes you are."  Miley slashed in with a bishop. "Checkmate."</P><P>"All right, you guys," bawled Trina, "I'm going to a counselors' meeting. You get yourselves to bed, on the double!" She walked out of the cabin, the <I>salet</I><I>é</I> tucked neatly under her arm.</P><P>Obediently the girls began to change into their pajamas for the night. Aside from a few flying articles of clothing, all was quite peaceful.</P><P>"What's going to happen?" whispered Lilly.</P><P>"We'll soon find out," said Miley. "Look. There she goes."</P><P>Ashley placed her hands on the bedpost and vaulted to her upper bunk.</P><P><I>Crash!</I> The unsupported mattress gave way and dropped straight down onto an unsuspecting Sarah who had been making herself comfortable below.</P><P>"<I>Augh!"</I> screamed Ashley who had tumbled down with it.</P><P>Muffled shouting came from under her. The other girls began rushing to the rescue.</P><P>Miley ripped the sheets off the nearest bed and hurled them into the midst of the confusion.  Lilly, instantly grasping the spirit of the thing, began racing around the cabin tossing pillows at random into the milling group.  Girls began throwing them back.</P><P>"<I>Rumble!"</I> shouted a deafening voice.</P><P>Lilly stared in open-mouthed amazement. The shout had come from Miley Stewart—Miley, who never raised her voice and never involved herself in anything.  That same Miley grabbed her, and the two of them shot out the door.</P><P>"Where are we going?"</P><P>"This brawl isn't big enough," Miley explained calmly. "We're going for reinforcements." Her eyes gleamed, although her face did not change expression. "And when it's all over, we can blame it on Ashley."</P><P>Lilly doubled over, remembering. "Did you see her fall? I thought I was going to choke!"</P><P>Miley walked up to Cabin 12, opened the door and leaned inside. "Pardon me," she said politely. "There's a pillow fight in Cabin 13. If you'd like to take part, you're quite welcome." Leaving the door open, she stepped aside, pulling Lilly with her. A stream of pajama-clad girls roared out the door, waving pillows and stampeding towards Cabin 13.</P><P>"Enthusiastic, aren't they?" commented Miley.</P><P>The door of Cabin 11 burst open and a voice called, "What's going on?"</P><P>"Big pillow fight in 13!" hollered one of the girls from Cabin 12. "Come on! It's going to be a lulu!"</P><P>Miley and Lilly stepped out of the way just in time to avoid the onrush from Cabin 11.</P><P>"Miley," said Lilly nervously, "what are we going to do?"</P><P>"Do?" said Miley.  "We're going to sit down right here on the grass and watch."</P><P>Cabin 13 appeared to bulge at the seams, to bounce and gyrate. Feathers from torn pillows fluttered through the open door and windows. Joyous shouts of combat came from within. The only discordant note to what seemed a grand party was the half-crazed voice of Sarah, which pierced the night air: "All right, Ashley! Now you're gonna <I>die!</I>"</P><P>Lilly noticed a gleam in Miley's eye.</P><P>"Ah, to be young again," Miley sighed. She looked at Lilly out of the corner of her eye. Lilly was watching the pillow fight, but when she sensed Miley looking at her, she glanced over and then looked away, lying back in the grass and rubbing a hand over her face. Never had she been more attracted to anyone like she was to Miley, and it was kind of weirding her out.</P><P>"Tired?" Miley asked, laying back and rolling her head to the side to look at Lilly.</P><P>Lilly shrugged. Her hand dropped from her face and she turned her head to look over at Miley.</P><P>As soon as they made eye contact, surprise flashed across Miley's face momentarily. She quickly schooled her features, though, and turned her head to look up at the stars. Meanwhile, Lilly's mouth had gone dryer than a desert.</P><P>"…Thanks for loaning me your pillow last night," Miley said finally. "I think I may have drooled on it though."</P><P>Lilly chuckled.  "That's okay," she said. "I'm sure my pillow is long gone by now anyway, thanks to the raging battle in our cabin."</P><P>The corner of Miley's lips quirked into a lopsided smile. She rolled over onto her side to face Lilly again, propping herself up with her elbow and resting her head in her hand. "God, your eyes are so blue," she said, her eyes sweeping Lilly's face. "They're like…I dunno…crystals or something."</P><P>Lilly blushed and looked away. "You sure are being more talkative than usual tonight," she observed. When she didn't get a response, she looked at Miley again. Miley was still looking at her.</P><P>"Miley?" Lilly ventured.</P><P>Abruptly, Miley sat up, wrapping her arms around her knees and looking at Cabin 13. "What?" she sighed.</P><P>"…Nothing," Lilly said, her courage failing her. She sat up as well, looking from Miley's passive face to the tumultuous cabin before them.</P><P>Even as they watched, the doors of Cabin 14 burst open and another dozen girls rushed in to join the fray, brandishing pillows. They were lost in the swirling clouds of feathers.</P><P>"Wow, look at that!" exclaimed Lilly, half in horror.</P><P>Miley nodded. "Camp," she said with an elaborate sweep of her arm. "Good, clean, wholesome fun. I wonder if they keep extra pillows in stock?"</P><P>"I tell you, it's a box of dirt. Nothing but a box of dirt!" exclaimed Trina angrily.</P><P>Chantel gaped in amazement at the box she had seen Miley and Lilly build. "I thought they were just being snarky when they told me they were going to fill it with dirt," she said, shaking her head. "They sure are strange kids, especially that girl Stewart."</P><P>"Strange isn't the word I'd use for Stewart," growled Trina. "Crazy would be more like it." She banged her fist on the table. "I don't like being lied to! They said they were building a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>, and <I>this</I> is what they hand me!"</P><P>Chantel laughed out loud. "And that's exactly what you got—a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>."  She stopped to catch her breath. "It's French, Trina. It means dirt!"</P><P>Trina was struck dumb.  For a moment she stared at the blue box as if hoping that the fury in her eyes would vaporize it. Then, "Of course I know that <I>salet</I><I>é</I> means dirt!" she howled furiously. "Do you think I'm stupid?"  She stood up, her face bright red. "Excuse me," she said.  "I've got to do something back at the cabin." She went out the door of the mess hall in a dead run.</P><P>"Stewart!" she muttered as she headed towards Cabin 13. "Stewart!"</P><P>A steadily increasing roar met her ears as she ran. The general noise separated itself into individual shouting voices and falling furniture. She put on a burst of speed, rounded the sports equipment shed and stopped short.</P><P>Cabin 13 was teeming, both inside and out, with pajama-clad girls merrily swinging at each other with pillows amid a snowstorm of feathers. The ruckus had grown, and by now most of the camp was involved.</P><P>Trina's anguished eyes caught sight of two figures sitting passively on the grass. She charged up, howling, "<I>Stewart!</I> What's going on here?"</P><P>"I think it's a pillow fight," offered Miley.</P><P>"What are you doing out here?"</P><P>"I don't fight," said Miley evenly.</P><P>"What started this?" cried Trina frantically.</P><P>"It was all Ashley's fault," tattled Miley. "She jumped on Sarah for no reason at all."</P><P>Arms flailing wildly, Trina rushed towards her cabin. She could not get near the door.  "Break it up! <I>Break it—!</I>" She was hit full in the face with a pillow which exploded and sent more feathers flying everywhere.</P><P>Trina came up sneezing and blowing short blasts on her whistle. Now on her hands and knees, she made another attempt to get inside Cabin 13, sneezing and howling madly.</P><P>Miley pointed towards the mess hall. "Look. A thundering herd of clones," she observed. "Now the feathers will really fly."</P><P>Lilly, who had not stopped laughing since Trina's pillow to the face, could not reply.</P><P>The ground trembled and whistles shrilled as the counselors hurled themselves into the heart of the ruckus. For the next few minutes the area boiled like a volcano. Pillows shot around like lightning bolts, and the feathers were so thick they obstructed all vision. Then, slowly, the riot began to peter out. Still, it was a full ten minutes before the air cleared and silence fell.</P><P>Slowly, and with much effort, Trina got to her feet. Her face flaming red, she walked through the crowd, which parted in front of her, sensing the intensity of her emotions. Still she walked, until she was directly facing the side wall of the cabin. She stared at it for what seemed like a long time. Then she threw her head back, roared her anger to the sky, lifted her foot and dealt the cabin a mighty kick.</P><P><I>Crack!</I></P><P>A large chunk of the cabin wall splintered away and fell inside the building. A long, jagged split appeared in the wall itself, extending from the hole all the way up to the window. The window frame came loose and the glass shattered. The split divided into a number of smaller cracks which spidered through the wood up to the roof. A lone roof shingle jarred loose and fell to the ground, landing at Trina's feet with a soft thud. She looked down at it incredulously as the breeze whistled softly through the gaping hole in the cabin.</P><P>There was an awful silence.</P><P>"Say," came the dry voice of Miley Stewart, "it looks as if we're going to have to sleep in trees after all."</P><P>Deep in the wooded area beside the creek, the beaver stirred restlessly. Once again human noise had disturbed him. There had been loud noises when his old dam was destroyed. This dam must remain safe.</P>
