<p><b>12:10 PM Frasier Crane's Apartment</b></p>
		<p>"Absolutely not!" Daphne Moon snapped, waving her dust cloth around for emphasis. "I'm not paying for a psychiatrist when I have you and Dr. Crane right here."</p>
		<p>"But Daphne, you have to talk to somebody! You've been quiet and teary all week long. It seems your bottling something all up and burying it inside yourself. You need some release." Frasier said, resting a hand on her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Why can't I just talk with you or Dr. Crane?" Daphne persisted.</p>
		<p>"Because either Dr. Crane or myself could be the cause of your feelings." Frasier said gently. He was surprised to see tears shining in Daphne's eyes.</p>

		<p>"Alright Dr. Crane, I'll go. But only if you insist on it."</p>
		<p>"Good. I have the arrangements already made. This woman, Dr. Carrigan, is a very good friend of mine. Niles has his office right next door. Your appointment is at one tomorrow. The session is on me."</p>
		<p>"Dr. Crane! I couldn't possibly impose on you like that. I can pay me own way through."</p>
		<p>"Oh no worries Daphne, everything is taken care of."</p>
		<p>"I suppose so." Daphne sighed reluctantly, as Frasier slipped on his coat.</p>
		<p>"I'm meeting Niles for lunch at Café Nervosa, I'll see you later." Frasier said, opening the door to leave. "Oh, and Daphne?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, Dr. Crane?"</p>
		<p>"I insist."</p>

		<p><b>Café Nervosa- 12:30 PM</b></p>
		<p>"Hello Frasier!" Niles rasped, grinning cheerily as Frasier pulled out a chair and seated himself.</p>
		<p>"Hello Niles." Frasier said carefully. "What has you as high as a kite?" Niles giggled, almost giddily.</p>
		<p>"Oh Frasier, things are going fabulously with Mel! I don't think I've ever been so happy!" He croaked, emitting a little cough.</p>
		<p>"That?s great!" Frasier said half heartedly, stirring at his capuccino. "You sound terrible though Niles."</p>
		<p>"Oh not really, its just a little cold" Niles said, frowning a little. "Although Mel doesn't like to get too affectionate when I'm sick. She hates the germs." Frasier winced at the thought of "affection" from Mel.</p>
		<p>"So how is Daphne doing?" Niles asked casually.</p>
		<p>"Actually she's not doing so well I'm afraid. I finally convinced her to see Dr. Carrigan before I left. She seems depressed, and frankly I'm a bit worried about her. But its likely she's just fine. Probably just wedding business." Niles face paled visibly, it was evident that he was very upset.</p>
		<p>"Are you sure she'll be ok?" He asked, his scratchy voice not able to cover his concern.</p>
		<p>"I think so." Frasier said. "Are you ok Niles?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, fine." Niles said absently. "Dr. Carrigan you say?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, why?" Frasier replied, looking puzzled.</p>
		<p>"Oh, no reason. Just curious." Niles murmured. "Just curious..."</p>

		<p><b>12:55 PM The Following Day, Dr. Cardigan's Waiting Room</b></p>
		<p>Daphne nervously entered the small, but richly furnished waiting room of Dr. Carrigan. A smiling, elderly receptionist sat behind a large oak desk. "Ahh yes. You must be Ms. Moon." The receptionist said with a big smile.</p>
		<p>"Yes, that?s me." Daphne said, mustering up a small smile for the nice old woman.</p>
		<p>"Dr. Carrigan will be right with you dear."</p>
		<p>"Ok, thank you" Daphne said politely, seating herself on a lush leather chair. She absently picked up a magazine from a marble coffee table and flipped through it, only pretending to read it. She was too distracted with confused emotions and stray thoughts to really pay attention. She just couldn't seem to piece her jumbled feelings together. She was having serious doubts about her marriage to Donny and she was desperately trying to define them as wedding jitters. The voice of Dr. Carrigan jarred Daphne out of her thoughts.</p>
		<p>"Daphne?" the doctor said, opening the door to her office invitingly. Daphne stood, and placing the magazine back on the table, she followed Dr. Carrigan inside.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>1:01 PM Niles Cranes Office</b></p>
		<p>Niles stared blankly at the notepad on the desk in front of him, containing the notes from his last patient. His heart just wasn't in the work today. Things were just beginning to look great with Mel until an argument the previous night had brought everything all crashing down. Daphne's wedding was looming closer and although he tried to convince himself he was over her, he knew deep down he wasn't. And it hurt.</p>
		<p>"How are you today?" Startled, Niles recognized the voice of his neighboring psychiatrist, Dr. Carrigan.</p>
		<p>"I'm OK." Came the reply from a very familiar English accented voice.</p>
		<p>Daphne.</p>
		<p>Holy Mary, God, Jesus, and all the Saints! After all his problems with Mel he had totally forgotten what Frasier had told him about Daphne's appointment! And ironically the heating vent was open and Niles could hear every last word of the conversation next door.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>Dr. Cardigan's Office</b></p>
		<p>Daphne sank into a comfortable couch opposite the chair Dr. Carrigan had settled into. Dr. Carrigan was an attractive woman in her early thirties. Her blond hair was pulled back into a tight bun. To Daphne her most striking feature was her piercing eyes. They were violet. "So Frasier tells me your having a pretty crappy week." Dr. Carrigan began, her eyes studying Daphne intently. Daphne had to half smile. She thought that maybe she could like this woman. She was very nice, but very, very straight to the point.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I'm going to be married in less than two weeks...but I am having these--other feelings and I'm so confused!" Daphne said, letting it all pour from her.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>Niles's Office</b></p>
		<p>Niles tried to calm his rapidly beating heart and think rationally. He shouldn't be listening to this now. It was morally wrong and it totally betrayed Daphne's trust and their friendship. It was wrong, not to mention against the law. He should go on his lunch break and forget this ever happened. Making up his mind, he stood and began arranging his papers in preparation to leave for lunch. The conversation from the next office still drifted in through the vent.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>Dr. Cardigan's Office</b></p>
		<p>"Can you tell me what these other feelings you have been experiencing are all about?" Dr. Carrigan asked. Daphne sighed.</p>
		<p>"I have been trying to classify them as wedding jitters, but now I see that it goes much deeper than that. It all started when I was giving Dr. Frasier Crane a massage. He had taken these pills and he was really out of it. He was saying a lot of weird things, when he spilled a secret to me. He told me that his brother, Dr. Niles Crane, is in love with me."</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>Niles's Office</b></p>
		<p>Niles went weak at the knees. He could no longer stand up and he collapsed back into his chair. He couldn't believe it! She knew! There was no rational thinking now. Everything had spun out of control. He fought the entire situation with everything he could muster. This had to end! But he just sat numbly in his chair. Just then, his secretary walked in.</p>
		<p>"Dr. Crane, is it alright if I go to lunch now?" She asked hopefully.</p>
		<p>"Of course." Niles said kindly, relief washing over him. "But before you go I do believe that the heating vent is open. Would you mind closing it for me?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, Dr. Crane!" His secretary said, smiling at him. "You sound awful! Are you feeling alright?" she asked as she replaced the vent cover.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I feel fine. No worry." Niles lied. In truth he felt terrible. His head hurt, his throat hurt, his entire body hurt. "But if you would, please cancel the rest of todays appointments. Then you may have the rest of the day off." He told his secretary.</p>
		<p>"Certainly!" His secretary chirped. "Thank you Dr. Crane!" Niles nodded and gave her a tight smile. He just wanted to get out of his office and away from everything. He was furious with Frasier and he felt as if he'd been run over by a truck. But most of all he felt ashamed for listening in on part of Daphne's session. It began to rain as Niles left his office.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>Dr. Cardigan's Office</b></p>
		<p>Dr. Carrigan was having a very hard time masking her shock with a professional demeanor. "So you must have been pretty shocked receiving that information! How did you feel about it?" She asked, relieved that her voice was smooth and calm.</p>
		<p>"I was very shocked,yes, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made to me. I realized what Frasier had said to me was true. After I found out, something was different inside of me. It?s a feeling I have never experienced before. I find myself seeing Dr.Crane through new eyes. I have always considered him a best friend to me, but we are so different and I was afraid to look at him any way that was above friendly, even if I only did this subconsciously. He makes me feel like no other man has ever made me feel before, including Donny. Lately I have been finding less and less that I like about Donny, but I continue to stay engaged to him because I fear that this might be my last chance at marriage. But I think about Dr. Crane everyday, and I dream about him too. Lately when he comes around I find myself enjoying the feelings he stirs in me more and more. I don't know what to think about all this at all. I wonder if its fear of commitment or if I have fallen for another man." Daphne let the confession flow from her, glad to have it off her chest. After Daphne finished speaking they sat in silence, Dr. Carrigan staring, intent on her thoughts. Finally she looked up to give Daphne the advice she had come looking for.</p>
		<p>"Daphne, I am going to be honest with you and give you the advice that I really feel is the right thing. Usually I don't like to get to deeply involved in the private lives of the people I see and let my personal feelings get involved but I feel that this time is different and I need to tell you the way I see it.The feelings you are having are not wedding jitters, fear of commitment, or anything else falling into that category. You, Ms. Moon are in love with Niles. I do not think that Donny and you will have a healthy relationship if you do get married because of your feelings for some one else. Now I am not going to involve myself any further. You have to make the decision from here. Listen to what your heart tells you."Dr. Carrigan paused and looked at her watch "I do believe that our hour together is up." Daphne, who had remained silent through out Dr. Cardigan's entire speech, now rose from the couch and walked towards the door.</p>
		<p>"Thank you Dr. Carrigan. I will think over what you said." She gave her a small smile before walking out of the office, and into the rain.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Niles walked alone along a parks deserted path, through the rain and the mist that swirled about him. The rain that soaked through his clothes, and flattened his hair to his head, also hid the lonely tear that trickled down his cheek. He had made a mistake. A terrible one. One that could alter the friendship he already had with Daphne if she knew what he had done. He shouldn't have listened in at all because it only made his life more miserable. Daphne knew now, she knew that he was in love with her. Niles was sure she didn't love him back. He was glad that the grate had been closed before he could hear it straight from her mouth. At least before, he could pretend that if she knew, she would love him back.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Daphne felt completely torn as she drove home. All she had ever wanted was to get married and have a couple of children. She didn't see why that was so much to ask for. The cold reality that she didn't want to spend the rest of her life with Donny was sinking in. She had fallen in love with some one else</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Niles walked out of the park and out onto the street. As much as Niles dreaded it, he knew he had to go home. He was getting dizzy, and Daphne seemed to appear everywhere. She came from store fronts, and allies,and she rounded street corners. Niles knew he must be hallucinating. He had to get somewhere for help fast, but he wasn't quite sure where he was. Than Daphne appeared again. She crossed the street and motioned him to follow her. By than Niles knew he was really sick, and he was hallucinating again but his only choice was to follow her, she was his only hope. As if in a trance he followed her image and as they weaved through the people and walked many blocks he began to recognize where he was. His vision of Daphne led him right to the lobby door of Frasier's apartment! Than she faded away right before his eyes.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Daphne sat, lost in thought, on Frasier's couch, her chin resting in her hand. All of a sudden she felt a deep sense of foreboding and something told her that some one very close to her was in trouble. The feeling grew until one of her visions hit her, and suddenly she was crossing a street in Seattle and motioning for some one to follow her. She couldn't see the persons face but she deduced that this was the person close to her that needed help. She could tell one thing, and that was that the person was a male. She led him all the way to the front door of Frasier's apartment building, than her vision ended, and Daphne was back on the couch, very stunned. She had never had such a realistic vision before.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Niles entered Frasier's apartment building, stumbled across the lobby and into the elevator. Though his vision was swimming he managed to press the number of Frasier's floor. He pressed his head against the elevator door. He had the feeling that he was going to black out. Very soon. To his relief the elevator door opened and he emerged in the hallway outside of Frasier's door. He banged on it with all the strength he had left. He heard Daphne hurrying to answer the door, and as she opened it he fell forward, and into complete darkness.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>As Daphne opened the door, Niles fell forward. Daphne automatically held out her arms and caught him. "Oh my God!" She whispered, laying Niles softly down onto the floor. She checked for a pulse. It was there, but she could tell that it was weakening. She pulled Niles's cell phone out of his trench coat and dialed for an ambulance. Daphne was bordering hysteria as she turned off the cell phone. "Hold on, Niles." She whispered, gently stroking his face. 10 minutes passed and Daphne waited impatiently by Niles's side. Soon 10 minutes turned to twenty, and finally Daphne could wait no more. "Bloody damn this!" She muttered angerly, trying to hold back tears of frustration. Daphne couldn't stand sitting around watching Niles slowly fade away from her. She was going to have to get him help herself. She stripped him down to his boxers, and tore apart Frasier's closet looking for a warm robe. She grabbed a blanket off of Frasier's bed, and running back out to Niles she dressed him in the robe and wrapped the blanket securely around him. Than Daphne picked Niles up from the floor and slung him over her shoulder as gently as she could. Daphne left the apartment without even bothering to close the door and ran down the stairs, trying not to buckle under Niles weight as she ran. She ignored the stares people gave her as she dashed through the lobby and the parking lot. Her priority now was Niles, even if people were looking at her for running around with a blanketed man in boxers over her shoulders. Daphne let Niles down softly on the backseat of her car and than she drove towards the hospital like all hell had broken loose and was chasing her from behind.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Daphne pulled into a parking space at the hospital and slammed on the brakes. She winced as she heard Niles tumble off the seat and land on the floor with a loud thud. Daphne hoped to God he hadn't felt that. She felt his pulse, it was even weaker than it had been before. This time Daphne carried Niles in her arms, his head rested on her shoulder. She broke into a brisk run and burst through the emergency room doors. "This man needs help!" She yelled. Two doctors who were talking with the nurse working at the front desk ran over and took Niles from her arms. Another doctor appeared, rolling a gurney. The nurse from the front desk jogged along side Daphne as she followed Niles and the doctors.</p>
		<p>"Could I have the patients name please?" The nurse questioned.</p>
		<p>"Niles Crane." Daphne said, looking mournfully at his figure lying motionless on the gurney.</p>
		<p>"Whats his social security number?" The nurse asked, looking sympathetically at her.</p>
		<p>"Uhm I'm not sure" Daphne answered.</p>
		<p>"Could I have your name please?"</p>
		<p>"Daphne. Daphne Crane." Daphne blurted in a soft voice.</p>
		<p>The nurse placed a reassuring hand on Daphne's arm before turning and going back down the hall.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>The doctors repeatedly asked Daphne to go and sit in the waiting room but she refused to leave Niles side. When they started sticking needles and tubes into him, Daphne finally left to call Frasier. She couldn't bear to watch them do those things to Niles.</p>
		<p>Frasier, who was already worried when Daphne called was distraught to hear Daphne's tearful story and he promised that he would be at the hospital as soon as he could, along with Martin and Roz.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Daphne was glad when Frasier arrived with Roz and Martin. She couldn't help sobbing into Frasier's shoulder and they both cried together when the doctors told them that Niles had gone into a coma.</p>
		<p>The four of them sat in the waiting room the entire night. Roz's face was pale, and she stared straight ahead. Martin was always looking towards the floor, trying to hide the tears in his eyes. Daphne sat back in her chair, her eyes closed, trying to block out the grief, and Frasier held his face in his hands. When dawn came it was clear that every one needed sleep.</p>
		<p>"I'll stay with Niles, you all need to go home, shower, and try to get some sleep." Daphne told them, trying to stifle her yawns.</p>
		<p>"Oh Daph, we couldn't leave you here like this." Roz said.</p>
		<p>"No, I'll be fine, you have Alice to think about Roz."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure Daphne?" Martin asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes! Now get your bloody butts out of here!" Daphne said impatiently.</p>
		<p>Martin gave Daphne a hug and motioned for Frasier and Roz to follow him out of the hospital. He had a feeling that Daphne wanted to be by herself, for some strange reason...</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>Daphne walked down the hall towards Niles room.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me Miss, but visiting hours are over." A tired looking doctor told her. Daphne ignored him and he didn't follow her down the hall. 'He must have worked all night.' She thought to herself as she stopped outside of Niles's door. Swallowing hard, she entered into his room. She choked back a sob as she approached his bed and saw the IV's and tubes. The only sign that Niles was alive was the slow rise and fall of his chest. Daphne took his hand in hers and stared longingly at his face, wishing he would wake up so she could lose herself in the deep blue pools in his eyes, and tell him that she loved him.</p>
		<p>She loved him.</p>
		<p>Daphne climbed up onto the bed and lay down with Niles. One lone tear slid down off her chin, and landed on his cheek.</p>
		<p>"I love you." She whispered, running her hand down his face. "Please come back to me."</p>
		<p>Daphne rested her head on Niles chest, breathing in his familiar scent. She listened to the steady beating of his heart, and soon, she was fast asleep.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p>It was dark. Completely black. There was nothing. Just empty space. Niles felt like he was asleep, but he couldn't wake up, no matter how hard he tried. He couldn't feel his body either. It was the most scary feeling he had ever experienced in his entire life. Suddenly he was conscious of everything. He could feel. He felt something wet fall onto his cheek and than he heard three whispered words, like an echo on the wind. "I love you."</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>8 hours later.</b></p>
		<p>Niles eyes fluttered open. He wasn't even aware that he had fallen asleep. He could only remember somebody telling him that they loved him, before his memory went blank again. Niles blinked in the sudden brightness. His settings were very foreign to him and he realized that he was in a hospital. Just then he felt another presence have beside him, half on top of him. He felt silky hair on his chest, and he smelled an extremely familiar scent. Daphne was asleep in his bed! Could it possibly be? Was she the one that had said those words to him? That was doubtful, he thought glumly. Daphne was sleeping so peacefully, and he was reluctant to wake her but he knew that she would probably want to notify the doctors that he was awake. He also knew that he had to tell her what he had heard. The guilt was consuming him inside. "Daphne? Daphne, wake up." He said hoarsely, while caressing her cheek. Daphne stirred against his chest and looked up at him in complete surprise. Tears shined in her eyes, as she looked deep into his own dark blue ones.</p>
		<p>"Is it really you?" She said, her voice thick with tears. Niles took her hand.</p>
		<p>"Yes, its really me." He said, wiping a tear off her cheek with his thumb.</p>
		<p>"I love you, Niles." She said. Niles jaw dropped open, she had used his first name too!</p>
		<p>"So it was you that said that last night!" He said, looking at her incredulously. Daphne kissed his cheek.</p>
		<p>"It was me Niles. I realized it wasn't Donny I was meant to be with, but you!" Niles was on the verge of fainting, but he couldn't let Daphne continue, not with out admitting what he had done first.</p>
		<p>"Daphne, wait...theres something I have to tell you." Daphne looked at him, confusion and fear filling her face. "Daphne, I do love you, so much but I couldn't let this go any further before I tell you what I did. You will probably hate me for this and if you do I would completely understand, but I couldn't live with myself if we had a relationship and I never told you this. I would break your confidence more than I already have." Niles was struggling very hard to get this out and his heart was being torn apart with every word.</p>
		<p>"What is?" Daphne asked quietly.</p>
		<p>"When..." Niles took a deep breath. "When you went to Dr. Carrigan's office there was a vent open between her office and mine, the office custodians must have left it open, but I heard a large part of your session with her through the vent. When I found out that you knew that I was in love with you I was totally crushed. Than my secretary came in and I asked her to close the vent for me. I should have done it myself and walked away from the whole situation, but I didn't. I also thought that you knew about my feelings for you and you didn't feel the same way back. I left the office and walked around in the rain, until I became delirious and I had this hallucination of you leading me to Frasier's apartment. Than I knocked on the door and you opened it. Thats all I remember." Daphne was silent and Niles looked away, trying to hide the tears falling from his eyes. Daphne brought a hand to his face and tilted his head back to look at her.</p>
		<p>"Niles, I value my privacy and you had no right to listen in on my session....but I love you, and if you had listened a little longer you would have found that out. That was an incredibly noble thing to do, admitting that to me and I don't hate you. You are forgiven...how could I not forgive you....I almost lost you!" Niles wrapped his arms around her and stroked her soft beautiful hair.</p>
		<p>"I love you Daphne, you are my goddess, my angel." Daphne smiled into his neck.</p>
		<p>"You weren't hallucinating about me leading you to your brothers apartment.I had a vision, I felt that some one close to me was in trouble and than I was suddenly in the streets of Seattle leading a man to your brothers front door! Now I know that man was you. Were soul mates Niles, star crossed lovers." Daphne whispered into his ear. Niles couldn't stop the huge smile that was spreading across his face. Daphne pressed her lips to his and kissed him softly. Niles deepened the kiss and they continued their intimate actions for an extended period of time. It was the most magical thing either of them had ever felt.</p>

		<p align="center">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p>

		<p><b>Same Time In The Hospital Waiting Room</b></p>
		<p>Frasier, Martin, and Roz had returned to the hospital along with Donny. They had also contacted Mel over the phone. Five minutes after they arrived Mel came storming in.</p>
		<p>"Where is Niles?" She asked loudly as soon as she walked into the room. "I demand to see Niles now!"</p>
		<p>"Don't get your panties in a bunch!" Martin snapped. "He's right down the hall." Mel started down the hall a determined look on her face. The rest of the group followed close behind her.</p>
		<p>"Thats his room." Frasier said, pointing to a room two doors down from them. The whole group gasped when they entered the room. "What the hell is this?" Mel said glaring at Niles and Daphne who were cuddling innocently on the bed. Ignoring the look of death that Donny was flashing him Niles spoke up.</p>
		<p>"Everyone, Daphne is my new fiance."</p>
