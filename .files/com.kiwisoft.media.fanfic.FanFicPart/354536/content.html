<p>"WOW, it's beautiful Mom," exclaimed Buffy as Joyce
showed off her
engagement ring to the group.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's great, so when's the date?" Inquired Willow.</p>

<p>"We`re thinking April, May time frame," replied Giles as
he pulled
his fiancé into a hug.</p>

<p>"Way to go G, who would have trunk you had it in you,"
Blurted Faith
as she slapped the watcher on the back.</p>

<p>Tara walked up next to Faith and took her hand, blushing slightly at
the brunette slayers actions, "Congratulations Mr. Giles, Mrs.
Summers."</p>

<p>"Yeah congratulations G-man, you to Mrs. Summers," replied
Xander.</p>

<p>"Ditto," replied Anya.</p>

<p>Giles smiled as he though of his good fortune, not only did he have
wonderful friends but soon he would be marring the love of his
life, "Thanks."  </p>

<p>A mischievous grin came across Buffy's face, and she cocked her
head
towards Giles, "So I just have one question for you Giles, seeing
that you're going to be my step dad and all, I was wondering when
the
allowance kicks in."</p>

<p>"Buffy," exclaimed Joyce and Willow in unison as everyone
else in the
room started laughing.</p>

<p>"Hey a slayers got to try," she replied joining her friends
in
laughing.</p>

<p>Later that Evening.......</p>

<p>"So Faith, how did it go?" inquired Willow.</p>

<p>"How'd what go Red?" teased Faith.</p>

<p>"You know what she wants to know," replied Buffy, draping her
arm
around Willows shoulders as they continued on their nightly patrol.</p>

<p>"It went good.  I think we really hit it off."</p>

<p>"You think," pushed Willow.</p>

<p>"OK, you got me it went great, we spent half the night getting to
know each other  We talked about everything, our likes, dislikes,
hopes, you know all that kinda stuff."</p>

<p>"How about the other half of the night," jested Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow didn't know what surprised her more, the fact that her
girlfriend had actually asked that question or the fact that Faith
seemed to be blushing, "Buffy, aren't you being a little bit
nosy."</p>

<p>"And aren't you a little bit curious yourself," responded
the blonde
slayer.</p>

<p>"It's OK Red," replied a flustered Faith, "Nothing
else really
happened.  We held hands for a while then fell asleep.  We're
taking
your guys advise and taking it slow."</p>

<p>"Good." replied Buffy and Willow in unison.</p>

<p>Before anyone could say another word on the subject Buffy stopped
walking and motioned towards the nearby tree line, "I think we
have
company," she replied, as a dozen vampires slowly began to emerge
from the trees.</p>

<p>Faith took up a fighting stance as Buffy stepped forward placing
herself between the approaching vampires and Willow, "Stay behind
me
Wills."</p>

<p>"What do we have here,"  Replied one of the vamps.</p>

<p>"Looks like slayer number one, her little witch, and slayer
number
two," answered another vamp.</p>

<p>Buffy focused on the space just in front of her just like the Goddess
had shown her and it began to ripple, she then pushed forward at it
with her hand sending the a compressed pocket of air at one of the
vampires like it was a stake, reducing him to dust</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith sprung into action as the remaining vamps began to
charge.  Willow  threw her left hand up and a fire ball three feet in
diameter appeared above her head, she pointed towards the oncoming
vampires with her right hand, sending the ball careening into the
vampire closest to Buffy.  After the vampire had burst into flames
and turned to dust Willow reached out with her mind to Buffy and
formed a protective shield around her , once she was sure that her
lover was safe she reached out with her mind to Faith and did the
same for the brunette slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed a vampire by the shirt and flung him into a near by
tree then quickly connected a series of powerful jabs knocking
another one to the ground.  A third vamp toke a swing at her but she
was to quick for him and easily dodged the blow.  She kicked the vamp
in the groin sending him to his knees, producing Mr. pointy she
finished him off.  The blonde slayer then made a hand motion towards
one of the trees and the air around one of the larger branched seemed
to waver, suddenly the branch snapped of the tree, sailed through the
air, and staked a vampire who was trying to get past her.  </p>

<p>While she was doing this two vampires hand managed to move around in
behind her, they both leapt at the slayers back at the same time only
to be thrown to the ground by the protective field Willow had thrown
up around Buffy. </p>

<p>Faith had just staked one vampire and was exchanging punches with
another.    She wasn't sure what was happening in the fight but
knew
Willow was somehow behind it  Not only did none of the vamps punches
seem to harm her but every time he would connect the vamp would
cringe and stumble back a few steps.  She watched as the vamp fell
back once again from trying to attacker her, but this time he
awkwardly tripped over his own feet and fell to the ground.  Faith
was quickly upon him with her stake in hand.</p>

<p>Willow saw the remaining vampires start to run away, she waved her
hand in the air and creating a crystal clear ball, that appeared to
have a mini lighting storm going on inside it, over the area the
vamps where running towards.  Her eyes began to glow a bright green
as bolts of energy shot from the ball and vaporized the remaining
vampires upon impact.</p>

<p>Torin moved from the shadows where he had concealed himself and
watched as the three young women headed off into the night.  He was
confidant that the brunette slayer would be easy to deal with however
the red headed mage and the blonde troubled him.  From what he saw he
knew that the mage was indeed powerful and the blonde who he had
first mistaken for another slayer was a mystery.  Not only did she
appear stronger and faster that any mortal including a slayer should
be, but she somehow was able to manipulate the space around her and
use it as a weapon.  He thought for a moment and shuttered as he
recalled one of the ancient legends, could it be, could a Warrior of
Light have been called and his master was unaware of it.  Torin then
smiled, this was going to be harder than he though, but with
Ciarán's
help he would destroy all of them and their friends. </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Willow carefully looked over every inch of Buffy's body looking
for
even the slightest scratch that tonight's battle might had caused.
The slayer almost chuckled at her soul mates actions, "Wills,
I'm
fine.  I don't even have a paper cut thanks to that force field
of
yours."</p>

<p>"You sure?"</p>

<p>"Positive," replied Buffy patting the mattress, "care to
join me?"</p>

<p>"That would be nice," answered Willow as she sat down not on
the bed
where Buffy had indicated but in the slayers lap.</p>

<p>"Feeling a little bit frisky tonight, huh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," blushed Willow.
Buffy wrapped her hands around Willows waste and tenderly kissed her
neck, "I could do this all night."</p>

<p>"You could?"</p>

<p>"Yeah but I won't."</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed Willow who was enjoying her lovers treatment.</p>

<p>"Not that I don't want to but I have other plans for
you," huskly
spoke the slayer.  Using her rapid speed Buffy stood and spun around
with Willow in her arms and carefully placed the red head underneath
her on the bed.  She then deeply kissed Willow's lips.  </p>

<p>Willow's breathing was rhythmic as she tried to catch her breath
from
Buffy's passionate kiss.  She looked into the gentle blue eyes of
her
slayer, "Oh!"</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Faith was almost to Tara's dorm when a voice stopped her dead in
her
tracts, "Going somewhere slayer?"</p>

<p>She spun around to face the person who had spoken, suddenly she found
herself wishing that Buffy and Willow where with her, her hands began
to tremble as she watched the warlock make his way over to her.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of me, I mean you no harm, your not worth
the
effort," cruelly replied the slayer.</p>

<p>"W-what...do you want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing really, I was only wondering what it felt like to be the
second fiddle."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"You know what's it feel like to be nothing more than a side
kick to
the Blonde, though I don`t think you will manage to maintain that
status much longer now that she has her little mage."</p>

<p>Ciarán smiled as depression filled the brunettes face, and her
lips
started to quiver, "What use could the two of them possibly have
for
the likes of you, a sub power slayer who really doesn't
understand
the order of things."</p>

<p>"I...I..."</p>

<p>"Look at you, you can barely speak, what possible help could you
be
to them, if anything your a hindrance. They have to take time to make
sure you are properly protected in battle and eventually it will cost
one or both of them their lives, you should leave before they realize
how much of a waste you are.  Ah but you won`t, mainly because of
your girlfriend."</p>

<p>"How did you...."</p>

<p>Ciarán cut Faith off in mid-sentence, "How did I know, child I
know
many things.  How long do you think she will stay with you once she
figures out how pathetic you truly are.  Spare yourself the
heartbreak and leave while you still can."</p>

<p>Ciarán's sinister laughter filled the night sky as he watched
the
brunette run off towards the dorms openly sobbing. </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"Warlock, is it done," inquired Torin.</p>

<p>"Yes, With any luck the slayer will soon be on the run."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"She was devastated, if were lucky she might even do the job for
us,"
laughed the warlock.</p>

<p>"Good, now we must draw are attention to the Warrior of Light and
the
Mage."</p>

<p>"They are a powerful foe, how do you intend to deal with
them."</p>

<p>"With this," replied the Gray Demon, picking up a blowgun and
dart
from the table, "A little distraction and one shot is all I need
to
do the job"</p>

<p>"You plan on killing both of them with one dart?"</p>

<p>"No only the Warrior of Light."</p>

<p>"What about the Mage."</p>

<p>"If the legends I have read are true she will fade away rather
quickly after the Warrior of Light is gone, and then the way will be
ready for My Lord."</p>
