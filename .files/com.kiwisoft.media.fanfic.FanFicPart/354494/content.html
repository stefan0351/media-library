<!-- Legend \ Chapter 9: The Impaler Prince -->

<p>Vlad flung a table up against the wall smashing it
into little pieces as he screamed out Slavic
obscenities in an uncontrollable rage.  The witch had
been with in his grasp only vanish seemly into
nowhere,  how was that possible.  The more Vlad
thought about it the more enraged he became, he had
reached the point were he was beyond rage, lost to the
evil that poured through his dark heart.  Vlad walked
through the dust of the vampires that had allowed the
girl to escape towards Spike, “There are still a few
hours till sunrise, gather the rest of my children and
bring them to me.  I will find that witch even if I
have to tear this town apart,” snarled the master
vampyre.</p>

<p>“What of the one who escaped my Master, and the
slayers other friends,” Spike inquired, wondering if
the master still wanted the slayers friends help to
distract her.</p>

<p>“They are insignificant to me, I no longer wish for
them to be my prisoners, if you see any of them do to
them what you did to the boy, but save their deaths
for after the slayer is turned.  It will be easier if
she is thinking about  them laid up helpless in a
hospital.  Now get me my children, I want that witch”
Screamed the Vlad, his voice laced with the venom of
pure hatred, as he smashed his fist through the
concrete wall..</p>

<p>Then sun came up as it always does but the fact that
daylight had come to Sunnydale was lost on the slayer.
It did not matter that Wesley's party had been
completely wiped out and Tristin, who had been trying
to help them, now lay in a bed in the same trauma
center that Xander was in.  Nor did it matter that
Megan and Cordelia were missing and Giles house lay in
ruins.  She no longer even cared about Vlad Tepes
Dracul roaming the night, the only thing that Buffy
could focus on was her Willow.  The night had taken
the love of her life from her and she could feel her
heart falling apart,  sitting in the living room of
her mothers house, lost in despair, she once again
began to weep.</p>

<p>“Giles, can I talk to you,” Asked Joyce Summers.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Replied the watcher as he followed Buffy’s mom
into the kitchen leaving Buffy, Anya, and Kathryn
alone in the living room.</p>

<p>Joyce looked at the watcher then spoke, “I’m worried
about her Giles.  I have never seen her like this
before.  What can we do to find out what happened to
Willow and help Buffy“</p>

<p>Sadness filled the watchers face, “I don‘t know, I
just don‘t know,” He replied.  He wished he did but he
found himself lost and alone without any answers ,
they had barely survived the night, and now their
numbers were significantly reduced and Vlad Tepes was
on a rampage. &lt;what was to become of them&gt;</p>

<p>Sixty five vampires were gathered in the mansion, they
were the last of their kind that were in Sunnydale.
Vlad looked around the room at his remaining children,
so many of them had been sacrificed to get the witch
only to have her elude him, but once the sun fell once
again the world would feel his wrath and he would get
the witch into his grasp, there was no way he was
going to allow for that redheaded girl to get the best
of him.  Vlad walked over to Angel and removed the
sword from the traitor and broke it in half accrosed
his knee, he then proceeded to pummel maliciously on
his prisoner. </p>

<p>Joyce and Giles walked back into the living room and
Joyce went over and sat down next to Buffy putting her
hand on her daughters shoulder she Spoke, “We’ll find
Willow”</p>

<p>Giles motioned to Anya and Kathryn to join him in the
Kitchen as the Slayer began to speak.  Tears flowed
down her cheeks and her words came in between sob's of
sorrow, “And what if we don’t or if we’re to late”</p>

<p>“Don’t even think like that, somehow we will get to
her in time”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, I have seen it.  I have seen
what he is capable of doing,” Buffy winced as she
finished speaking, visions of the horrors that Vlad
Tepes might take on her beloved filled her mind.  &lt;My
God, what has happened to us&gt;</p>

<p>Giles looked at the two girls that sat accrosed the
table from him, “Anya I hate to make you rehash what
you went through but I need to know what you saw and
heard while you were Vlad Tepes prisoner”</p>

<p>Anya sat there for a moment, she felt a cold chill
slowly work its way up her spine as she began to
recall her ordeal, “It was awful.  Both night and day
I could hear Angel screaming from the hell they were
putting him through.  I was so terrified that I was
going to be next but they never did anything to me,
they just kept me locked in a cage”</p>

<p>Anya began to quiver as she recalled what Angel had
looked like before she had made her escape, “Giles He
is a mess, the things that have been done to him are
unspeakable.”</p>

<p>Giles and Kathryn both sat there in horror after
having heard Anya’s tale.  The images of what was
happening to Angel struck terror in there hearts as
they realized what it was that Vlad Tepes truly was.
That however was not what had frightened Giles the
most, when Anya had mentioned that she overheard Spike
and Vlad plotting to turn the slayer Giles felt his
heart skip a beat, the master vampyre wished to turn
the slayer so he could overrun the world.  For weeks
they had tried to determine what his plans were and
now that they knew he wished they didn‘t.</p>

<p>Angels face was swollen, his entire body was covered
with bruises from Vlad’s beating.  He was so weak from
the endless torture that he could no longer speak, all
he could do is whimper and howl out in pain each time
Vlad would strike him. &lt;Please God let me die&gt;</p>

<p>The five of them sat in the living room as different
members of the group tried to unsuccessfully reassure
Buffy that they would save Willow.  Giles was lost to
his thoughts , He knew now that Vlad was hiding out at
the mansion, but he also knew that the place was
constantly crawling with vampires, if they were to
successfully  get in there they would have to come up
with something really good.   He was just about to
start brainstorming with the group when Cordelia and
Megan walked through the front door and into the
living room.  Before anyone could respond to their
entrance Buffy jumped up from her chair and rushed
over to the two women, “Where's Willow”</p>

<p>Cordelia looked right at Buffy, “We don’t know”</p>

<p>“What do you mean you don’t know you were with her
weren’t you”</p>

<p>“Yes, but..”</p>

<p>“But nothing where is Willow,” shouted Buffy</p>

<p>Giles got up and walked over to the slayer, putting
his hand on her shoulder he spoke in a reassuring
voice, “Buffy calm down and let them speak, it is not
going to get us any closer to finding Willow with you
shouting at Cordelia and Megan”</p>

<p>Giles then led Buffy back to the table and Cordelia
and Megan followed him.  After everybody had set down
Giles looked towards were Megan was sitting,  “What
happened”</p>

<p>“I’m not really sure, we had to flee to the basement
after Vlad Tepes had them set fire to your house
because he had placed vampires at all off the exits.
When we got down there we ran into your storage room.
As soon  as we got in there Willow started chanting to
the Goddess and next thing I know were not in the
basement any more”</p>

<p>“Where were you,” Inquired Giles his voice filled with
curiosity.</p>

<p> “That’s just it, neither of us knows where it was we
were taken.  I remember being surrounded by light and
hearing the laughter of children and several people
talking at the same time,  I couldn’t make out what
they were saying or see anyone but Willow and
Cordelia.  Then the next thing I know the two of us
are standing outside this house and a voice told me
that the slayer was here and we should go inside.”</p>

<p>Cordelia then got up and walked over behind Buffy’s
chair, she placed her hand on the Slayers shoulder,
“I’m not sure where it was we were taken, but it was
comforting being there, I felt peace like I have never
felt before, I am sure that Willow is safe.”</p>

<p>Buffy turned her head around and looked up at
Cordelia, “But I need her, why didn’t whoever saved
you send Willow back to me.”  A fresh set of tears
rolled down Buffy’s cheeks as she stared at Cordelia
looking for an answer to her question, but the other
girl had none.</p>

<p>Vlad stared at the covered window that blocked the
sunlight from them, he clenched his fist tightly as he
looked at Spike, “Soon William I will make them pay
and I will have the Witch”</p>

<p>“Yes Master, but you should relax some, we can't do
anything until the sun goes down,” Replied the blond
vamp.</p>

<p>“You're quite right,”  replied the Master Vampyre as
he began to walk over towards Angel.  Once he got
their he picked one of the ice picks up off of the
table were one of his children had left them for him.
Gazing into the broken eyes of the traitor he spoke,
“If you think that it is impossible to make you suffer
more than I have already done, then you are gravely
mistaken”</p>

<p>Vlad Then pushed the ice pick through one of the cuts
in Angels arm and guided it out another, sinisterly
laughing as the traitor whimpered in pain.  He then
picked up another ice pick and turned towards Spike,
“Wouldn’t you know it, I have over forty of theses
marvelous toys”</p>

<p>Joyce had taken Anya to the hospital to see Xander
promising that they would be sure to make it back well
before night fell and Megan had tagged along so she
could check up on Tristin and report back to Giles on
the slayer in training’s condition.  Cordelia had
stayed behind to hold down the fort and Giles was on
the phone with England informing them of what had
happened while Buffy and Kathryn tried to get some
sleep before having to go out on patrol.</p>

<p>Buffy fell into a restless sleep, all her thoughts
were on Willow and she yearned to have her love by her
side.  As she slept a vision came to her.  She stood
amongst a beautiful garden with Willow,  The redhead
reached out and took her hand and then softly kissed
her.  Buffy looked at her love with tear stained eyes,
“I miss you, please come back to me”</p>

<p>Willow closed the gap between them and took Buffy in
her arms, “Don’t worry my love, I soon shall return”
Willow kissed the slayer once again, and then Buffy
awoke.  She sat there in her bed and touched her lips
were Willow had kissed her in her dream state,  She
knew now that her love was safe but that did not ease
the pain she felt from being separated from Willow.
As she got up to head downstairs a new set of tears
began to flow.</p>

<p>Cordelia had drifted off to sleep, as soon as she
entered REM sleep she found herself standing before
the Oracles.  “We have come to you with a warning,”
spoke the female.</p>

<p>“What is it,” asked Cordelia pretty sure she wasn’t
going to like the answer.</p>

<p>The male spoke, “The slayer must not go out on patrol”</p>

<p>“The other warrior is not yet in place, she can not
win the battle alone,” added the female</p>

<p>“The other must be returned before the Master Vampyre
can be faced”</p>

<p>“If she and the others go into the darkness without
the other there can only be one result”</p>

<p>“Behold what will become if the journey we warned you
against is made” said the male as the room around
Cordelia faded away.</p>

<p>Cordelia found herself standing in a pallor,  before
her stood  two caskets.  She walked up to them to find
that they held Giles and Kathryn.  Then that image
began to fade and and gave way to another.  She found
herself in the cemetery.  Vlad and Spike stood before
Buffy and Willows graves, suddenly the ground that
surrounded the tombstones began to move and two
freshly risen Vampires arose.  “Welcome to the new
order my children,” said the  Master Vampyre as that
imaged faded from Cordelia's mind.  She awoke rapidly,
a cold sweat poured down her body, and she screamed in
terror at what she had saw, “Giles!”</p>

<p>Joyce walked into the house with Anya and Megan to
find the others franticly packing every weapon they
could get their hands on.  Giles looked at them, “Grab
whatever you need for a few nights and grab it
quickly, it’s going to be dark soon”</p>

<p>“What's going on here,” asked a very concerned Joyce
Summers</p>

<p>“Mom, Spike knows about this house and that means were
not safe here, the rest of it  Giles can explain on
the way to the hotel.”</p>

<p>Joyce saw the look of total panic in her daughters
eyes and knew that something major was about to
happen.  She went to the closet and grabbed a suitcase
and headed up stairs to pack it as fast as she could.
A few minuets later the group was piling into two cars
and heading towards a hotel on the outskirts of town
were they hoped that Vlad would not be able to find
them.</p>

<p>The soft white light that surrounded Willow began to
take form and suddenly she found herself standing
under a tree by a babbling brook.  The tree was filled
with song birds who produced the sweetest melody she
had  ever heard.  Everything about this place seemed
surreal.  “Where am I,”  She thought out loud.</p>

<p>“This is the Forever,” said a beautiful female voice
that was even sweeter than the melody of the song
birds.</p>

<p>Willow turned to see who had spoken to her.  The woman
who stood before her was radiant.  She had long
flowing blonde hair that looked as if it was made of
silk, her eyes were crystal blue and instantly put
Willow at ease when she gazed in them.  The woman wore
a elegant white robe that gently fluttered with the
cool breeze that filled the air.</p>

<p>“We have much tot talk about child,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“Who are you”</p>

<p>“I am of the of the silver moon, I am the sister of
the hidden wood, I am the enchantress-Star of the
night, I am Mother of the ageless womb, the spinner of
fates, and the Weaver of dream webs, I am Brigid”</p>

<p>Vlad marched down the street into the heart of
Sunnydale followed By Spike and the rest of his
children, His vengeful eyes were focused on the task
before him, there would be no denying his wrath.  The
moment of reckoning had come, the night now belonged
to him, and any who would stand in his way would
perish before him.  He smiled his hateful smile as
they reached downtown, soon the witch would be his. </p>
