<!-- What Ever Happened To \ Part Six -->

<p>The following evening the two women were smiling as they entered the reunion together. "I knew it." Selma patted herself on the back. She looked over and found Trisha and Rex on the dance floor. "Damn, I'm good." She smirked as she waved Holly over. As the couple approached, Selma could see that they were glowing. After a brief round of chitchat, Whitney excused herself to get some drinks. Selma declined.</p>
		<p>"So?" Selma nudged the small blonde after Whitney was at a safe distance. Holly just blinked at her innocently. "Don't even try it," Selma warned her. "I saw what you did to her neck."</p>
		<p>"Oops." Holly blushed. "Selma, she's incredible."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh." Selma clapped gleefully.</p>
		<p>"Not just that." Holly swatted her. "We did talk last night and this morning."</p>
		<p>"Among other things," Selma added slyly. "And?"</p>
		<p>"And we seem to really hit it off," Holly added. "We're going to go out when we get back to the city. And we're driving back together."</p>
		<p>"I'm happy," Selma squealed.</p>
		<p>"You set this up, didn't you?" Holly accused her. "Whitney told me that her room was moved just before she drove down here."</p>
		<p>"So what if I did?" Selma smirked in a cocky manner. "She asked about you."</p>
		<p>"What?" Holly smiled.</p>
		<p>"She asked about you when she called," Selma informed her. "I knew you had a thing for her back in high school. Hey, you might not have hit it off. I just leveled the playing field. Just a little."</p>
		<p>"A little?" Holly laughed.</p>
		<p>"Yes, just a little," Selma argued. "The rest was up to the two of you. It still is."</p>
		<p>"I'm a little nervous." Holly grimaced slightly. "She wants me to meet her parents."</p>
		<p>"That's understandable," Selma responded. "And not in a moving-to-fast kind of way. They'll be here and you two are definitely here together."</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Holly sighed in relief. "You responsible for that as well?" she asked, pointing to Trisha and Rex on the dance floor.</p>
		<p>"Maybe." Selma shrugged just as Whitney returned.</p>
		<p>"What are the two of you grinning about?" Whitney inquired, absently rubbing the hickey on her neck. Selma shrugged innocently before making her escape. Whitney was a tall woman who looked like she could hurt her.</p>
		<p>"She was the one who moved your room reservation," Holly explained.</p>
		<p>"I always liked her." Whitney smiled brightly down at Holly.</p>
		<p>"Me too," Holly agreed as she wrapped her arm around Whitney's waist.</p>
