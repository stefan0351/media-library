<P>Seven stood under the starry sky holding B'Elanna in her arms. B'Elanna was
content to stay there for eternity, her face snuggled up against her lover's
neck, only it wasn't really her lover. </P>
<P>Seven had just experienced a sensation she had never known before. When
B'Elanna's tongue massaged her own, she was terrified and delighted at the same
time. Seven's knees grew weak but it was not the bio-electric field causing it,
and she knew that for certain. </P>
<P>Seven attempted to speak but no words would come. She was speechless.
B'Elanna nuzzled in closer and brought one hand up to undo Seven's bun. Blonde
hair fell into B'Elanna's waiting hand. Oh how long she had waited for this
moment, to feel the soft silky hair of her lover. Seven's heartbeat raced and
she struggled to breathe. She tried to make sense of the emotions flooding her
body and mind, but every time she tried to examine one emotion B'Elanna would do
something to bring about a new one. </P>
<P>The Borg was not in control anymore, she had given it up to Lt. Torres.
B'Elanna spoke amid her sobbing. "Why… did… you… leave me?" B'Elanna brought her
closer as if to stake possession of her lover on the lonely planet. </P>
<P>Seven was finally able to speak. "I did not leave you Lt. Torres." She said
in a confused tone. B'Elanna suddenly changed from sobbing to anger as she
brought her eyes up to look Seven in the eyes. "What are talking about you left
me 7 years ago, when you went on that suicide mission that I told you not to go
on." B'Elanna screamed through teary eyes. They were now at arms length,
B'Elanna holding tightly onto Seven's arms as if she was trying to squeeze her
anger into her lover. </P>
<P>"I believe you have mistaken me for someone else Lieutenant." Seven was
finally beginning to understand. She had read some articles on human delusions.
And she believed B'Elanna was experiencing one right now. </P>
<P>"Oh, don't pull that crap on me. I searched for you when everyone else said
you were dead. I searched for you even when I thought you were dead, but I never
stopped trying. Why, because I loved you and I thought you loved me too. Now
you're playing the I don't know who you're talking about crap!" Seven was
stunned. She didn't know how to respond. While Seven contemplated the situation
the grip on her arms grew tighter. </P>
<P>"Is that all you have to say after all we've been through, nothing!" B'Elanna
screamed one last time and released her hold on the blonde Borg. She stalked off
into the cold night air hoping to find some solitude after her heartbreaking
encounter. B'Elanna had dreamt of this moment for 7 long years, never thinking
it would actually come. Now she wished it never had. </P>
<P>Seven watched as B'Elanna slowly disappeared into the night. Then she came to
her senses and followed the delirious half-Klingon. B'Elanna didn't go far, she
had collapsed to the ground in tears, her arms holding her knees close to her
body crying her heartache. Seven stopped some distance from her not knowing what
she should do. </P>
<P>The chill of the night was taking it's toll on B'Elanna once again. Seven
could see her start to shiver. So the Blonde Borg decided to proceed with
caution not wanting to startle the Chief Engineer. Surprisingly, B'Elanna did
not look up as Seven came within a few feet of her. She continued to sob and cry
and rock herself trying to wish away the pain. </P>
<P>Seven's heart went out and instinctively, she reached out and placed her hand
on B'Elanna's shaking shoulder from behind. B'Elanna responded by placing her
own hand over Seven's. The Borg then kneeled down and embraced the sobbing
Lieutenant in her arms, hoping to comfort her and take away her pain. </P>
<P>"It is alright B'Elanna, I am here." Seven whispered softly in Lt. Torres'
right ear. "I will always be here." Seven's hold tightened. B'Elanna responded
by taking Seven's left hand in her right and squeezing it as if to say she
understood. The embrace continued into the night until they both fell asleep in
each others arms. The soft grass was B'Elanna's bed and Seven was her
blanket.</P>
