<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 4 -->

<p>"What? Did Angel at least set her up with one of those ankle
band things?" While some of the people in the room might have agreed
with Xander's exclamation they still rolled their eyes.  Buffy was one
of them as she spoke. "Sorry Xander, but Vampire Slayer was not on the
prison work release program." He was already pacing as most sat and he
stepped close to Buffy. "Then what is she doing out? I mean HOW many
people has she killed? How many times has she tried to kill us?"
Everyone was surprised as Willow spoke up. "But she didn't. I mean if
she's such a killer you would think she could have gotten one of us."
Xander looked shock. "So what? Were working on the idea her luck's not
going to improve?"</p>

<p>Tara seemed content to stay quiet, but the way Willow was
squeezing her hand made her want to speak. "What if she's telling the
truth?" Xander scoffed. "Mutually exclusive concepts." The cultured
tones of the former librarian Giles interrupted. "Then we will listen
to what she has to say." Buffy clasped her hands together. "Then she's
on the first bus out of town and out of our lives." Giles took a
breath as she turned to face Buffy. "You may want to reconsider that.
Our encounter with the first slayer seemed to say that your slayer
abilities might be developing further. That may apply to Faith as well
and I don't like the idea of her having to puzzle them out on her
own." Xander spoke up once more. "Well I don't like the idea of the
psycho slayer getting any more powerful at all!"</p>

<p>Giles looked dubious. "Well unless one of us is willing to
kill her I don't see any options." Everyone looked around until all
eyes were on Buffy, and the scrutiny caused the fair-haired slayer to
look guilty. "Ok, killing her is not an option… and if she really
wants to set things right I want to help her. If it does turn out that
this is all a set up it's probably better if I'm able to keep an eye
on her. I mean I doubt there is a jail that could hold her if she set
her mind to it." Willow seems to stare off into space as she spoke
again. "There's also the caged slayer thing." They all looked at her
and she blushed under the scrutiny. "Well, I mean not only can't she
hunt monsters but they could hunt her." Buffy looked shocked as if
that was a point she had not considered.</p>

<p>Xander looked around the room, except for a silent Riley Finn
and Anya he looked appalled. "So what? Just blood under the bridge?
Well you were a psycho killer before, but that's ok now?" They all
stared at him. "Fine, don't mind me. I'll just go barricade myself in
the basement." As he sank down on the couch Anya snuggled up to him.
"That sounds like a good idea. We will be able to have sex with out
any interruptions." The rest of the room stared at the couple as Buffy
spoke. "Not quite yet Xander. Faith should be here soon. It's like a
band aid, just five seconds of pain." Xander sank down further into
the couch. "Followed by five hours of agony." She wanted to be mad,
but even Xander didn't seem angry. It was just one of his tantrums and
Buffy responded like she usually did, with a roll of her eyes.</p>

<p>"So we listen to what she has to say, and then invite her to
stay in town?" Each seemed to register their vote with their eyes, but
left the decision in Buffy's hands. "Ok, ok we let her say her peace.
Then we tell her that we'd like her to stay." Her tone was firm and it
showed her mind was made up, but she still scanned the room. Willow
smiled at her, and while Tara seemed to be following Willow's lead she
was smiling as well. Giles smile was subtle, but his approval was
obvious to Buffy. Riley would barely meet her eyes while Anya didn't
seem to care. When she reached Xander he was unwilling to look her in
the eye, but the stubborn set to his jaw forced Buffy to suppress a
sigh.</p>

<p>The group seemed to stew for several minutes until a timid
knock was heard at the door. Buffy was the one to answer it, and was
actually able to muster a smile when she saw Faith there. While
Buffy's smile was unsure it caused a shy smile to appear on Faith's
face as Buffy gestured for Faith to enter. While her head stayed down
as she walked in it looked up resolutely as she took a breath to
speak. "I don't want to make this any more painful for you guys. So
I'll say what I came here to say, listen to what you want to say to
me, and then I'll go." While she swallowed nervously she was speaking
again before any would have a chance to reply. </p>

<p>"I know sorry doesn't cut it, and I can't take away the pain I
caused, but I can take responsibility for it, and I can say I don't
want you guys to have to carry it around anymore. You can feel free to
hate me, but you don't have to fear me." The remainder of her breath
left her in a rush and it seemed the groups signal to speak. Giles was
the first. "What will you do now?" Faith shrugged. "Slay, do what I
was born to do, but give back to the world instead of taking from it."
"You could do that here." Brown eyes opened wide and scanned the room
and except for the stony silence coming from Riley Finn and the
disinterest of the former demon Anya the only hostility she was from
Xander Harris. What shocked her was that not only did the faces not
seem hostile, but they actually seemed supportive, unsure, but
supportive. </p>

<p>Giles took a step closer. "While slayers traditionally work
alone, they have had the guidance of a watcher, and while I may no
longer be one officially I couldn't allow a slayer to face the world
alone." She seemed to step away. "It's cool. I've been able to take
care of myself." Giles nodded sadly. "Look where it's gotten you."
When he saw pain flash across her face he stopped. "Just please
consider my offer. You don't have to stay, but I have spoken with
Buffy and she has agreed to let you stay if you choose to." Faith
turned to face the face of Buffy Summers who was at that moment trying
to sink into the background. "Is that true B?"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded slowly. "You're a slayer. You could do good on
your own, but you could do even more good if Giles is there for you."
Faith slowly panned the room and her gaze next settled on the paired
Wiccans. "You ok with this Red?" Willow nodded, as Tara seemed to be
trying to fold herself up in the couch. "If Buffy is willing to trust
you then I will too." Faith then looked directly as Tara. "What about
you?" Tara seemed startled. "M…me?" Faith nodded silently. "I trust
Willow." The way that sentence had come out with out a stutter made
Faith smirk, but when it caused Willow to place a protective hand on
Tara's knee the smirk softened to a smile and Faith spoke. "I'm glad
you can. Trust is a rare commodity."</p>

<p>When she looked at Riley he gave a noncommittal shrug.
"Buffy's the slayer. I'm not." When Faith's eyes finally met the eyes
of Xander Anya spoke up. "I really don't care to be quite honest."
Faith shrugged and nodded. "I don't really think we tangled anyway."
Then all eyes fell on Alexander Harris as he spoke. "Sorry to spoil
the love in, but one thing slipped by. Why Faith? Why did you do it? I
understand the rest of us were just Buffy's weak spots to you, but why
have you been so focused on hurting her?" The room's eyes swung to
Faith, except for Buffy who was stepping into the way until Xander
intercepted her. "Come on Buffy, if she really wants to change then
she can answer the question. Come on Faith, was it because she had the
friends, the watcher, or just because she was prettier then you."</p>

<p>That caused even the stony expression of Riley's face to look
shocked as Buffy again tried to interfere. "That's enough Xander!"
"No, no it's not. Why Faith? Why did you help a guy turn into a demon?
Why did you try to poison Angel? Why did you steal Buffy's body? Why
do you hate her so much?" Xander was shouting as he finished but as he
stopped all eyes again fell to Faith, but she was only looking at
Buffy, tears silently sliding down her cheeks. "I don't hate her. I
never have. I love her. I loved her ever since that alley outside the
Bronze, but instead of letting that love lift me up I tried to use it
to drag her down." The dark slayer's words sucked the air out of the
room so that not even the regular sounds of people breathing were
there, only the sounds of Faith walking quickly to and out the door.</p>
