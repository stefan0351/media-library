<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 8 -->

<p>Giles was already deep into his research of the Book of Souls, still
trying to find some kind of clue that might help him to come up with a
translation for that elusive section that as yet had defied his attempts
at translating its mysteries into something he or Willow could
understand.
A smile cross his face when he thought of the young highly talented
witch. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;At least Willow was able to break the symbol codes.&lt;&gt; he admonished
himself. &lt;&gt;That's a hell of a lot more than you could old boy. If it
wasn't for her you'd still be wallowing around in some dusty library
lost. I just wish I could figure out how to translate ancient High
Gaelic.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Giles felt this way every time he thought about the petite red head and
her incredible talents, both in research and in the mystic arts and her
recent advances. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Pretty soon neither of them will need you at all.&lt;&gt; Giles speculated.
&lt;&gt;Then what will you do with yourself? Really Rupert, you are such an
idiot at times. Neither of them will ever let you leave. So what the
hell are you worried about?&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his two wayward charges
calling his name. </p>

<p>"Hey Giles, where are you?" Buffy called out as both girls collapsed
onto his couch. "Come on out here. We gotta talk." </p>

<p>"What is it Buffy?" he asked entering the room from his study. He looked
at the two obviously exhausted girls. "Good lord you two look positively
awful. Was last nights patrol that bad?" </p>

<p>"Gee thanks. I hope your better at talkin' to mom than you are to us."
Buffy scolded him. "You never tell a woman she looks awful, even if she
does." </p>

<p>"Ah..yes..well..ah Sorry about that." Giles stammered, more than a
little embarrassed at his tactless remark and the mention of Joyce
Summers,even by her daughter. "I suppose I could have phrased that
better, but that still doesn't answer my question. Was last nights
patrol that bad?" </p>

<p>"That's just the point Giles." Willow spoke out before Buffy could start
to babble again. "We haven't had any significant contact since we were
ambushed last week and well, Giles, quite frankly the pressure is
starting to get to both of us." </p>

<p>For the first time Giles took a really close look at both girls. Both of
them were looking pale and drawn, and Buffy was beginning to develop
dark circles under her eyes. He also noticed that both girls were
getting a little jittery. </p>

<p>"Come on Giles, we're not askin' for that much." Buffy said putting on
her best little girl pouty face (she knew he could never say no to that
face.) "All we want is one night off before the wedding and that's only
a few days away." </p>

<p>"Just one night to go out and act like two normal people in love."
Willow added. "All we want is a date, you know, dinner, maybe a movie,
maybe a little dancing. A little quiet, quality time to spend with my
bestest girl." </p>

<p>"Yeah, pleeeeese?" they said in unison putting their heads together,
making even the normally reserved Englishman chuckle at their antics. </p>

<p>Giles removed his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He knew he
had lost already and so did the girls. He was just stalling long enough
to salvage some small shred of his dignity before he surrendered.
Finally he replaced his glasses and let out a deep sigh of resignation. </p>

<p>"All right ladies, I suppose you have more than earned some time to
yourselves." Giles said, officially surrendering. "If you promise to
spend the remainder of the day resting, then I see no reason you can not
have a girls night out so to speak." </p>

<p>"We promise." Buffy said putting her hand over her heart. </p>

<p>"Swear it, honest." Willow joined in. </p>

<p>The girls jumped and hugged the stoic Englishman, who sputtered and
cleared his throat, blushing bright red embarrassed by their open
display of affection. Both girls left soon after the hugs, chatting
endlessly about their plans for their night out. </p>

<p>Giles smiled, slightly pleased with himself feeling he'd made the right
decision. He heard the door slam shut and returned to his research. </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow were making the best of their night off. Deciding to go
casual, Buffy wore a silk blouse tucked into her best designer jeans and
a pair of shiny black 'cowboy' boots. Willow wore white pants with a
black vest over a blue denim shirt and a pair of comfortable mules. As
planed they stepped out their front door around 7:30 pm and linking arms
the two lovers strolled down the sidewalk for their much anticipated
date. </p>

<p>Their first destination was their favorite restaurant for a leisurely
candle light dinner. From there they went to see a movie that Willow had
wanted to see, but they spent so much time kissing and groping each
other in the dark theater that they missed most of the movie. So Buffy
promised to rent it when it came out on video. </p>

<p>They left the movie and walked the streets of downtown Sunnydale hand in
hand enjoying the night air and the pleasant company. </p>

<p>"I wish we could be like this forever." Willow said with a wistful sigh. </p>

<p>"Yeah." Buffy agreed. "No vamps, no demons, no Slayer, no destiny, just
you and me together. Yeah, I'd really like that." </p>

<p>Willow let go of Buffy's hand and slipped her arm around the blonde
girls waist and lay her head on the Slayers shoulder. </p>

<p>"This is nice." Willow whispered happily. </p>

<p>"Uh huh." Buffy answered kissing her lovers head. </p>

<p>"Do we have to go home yet?" Willow inquired. "I really don't want
tonight to end yet." </p>

<p>"Me either." Buffy said stopping. "But where should we go?" </p>

<p>"Some place fun." Willow said stepping back and seeing the mischievous
smile on her lovers beautiful lips. </p>

<p>"Some place with decent music." Buffy said to give her little witch
another hint as to what she had in mind. "Where we can dance." </p>

<p>"Somewhere some of our friends might be." Willow laughed her eyes
lighting up at the prospect of returning to their old haunt. </p>

<p>"The Bronze!" They both said at the same time. </p>

<p>Buffy took Willows hand and began pulling her anxiously toward their
destination. They were both eager to see their favorite old hang out.
Neither one of them had been there since they'd become a couple. In
fact, this would be the first they'd been anywhere that they had hung
out at before their coming out. </p>

<p>"Hurry up pokey." Buffy called out playfully as she tugged at Willows
sleeve. </p>

<p>Willow laughed and allowed her soulmate to drag her through the streets
of Sunnydale until they came to the old warehouse that had been
converted into the most popular dance club in the area. As they
approached they could feel the vibrations of the heavy bass emanating
from the club. </p>

<p>"Come on Buffy slow down please." Willow pleaded breathlessly. "Let me
catch my breath. What's the big hurry?" </p>

<p>Buffy stopped and pulled the red head to her, pressing her body tightly
against her lovers. Buffy gazed longingly into the dark green eyes of
her universe. </p>

<p>"I can't wait to get you on that dance floor." Buffy growled and ground
her pelvis into Willows. "Those kids haven't seen hot 'til I get you out
there." </p>

<p>Willow looked into Buffy's heavy lidded lust filled eyes and gulped. Her
heart was pounding hard against her chest. </p>

<p>"We could go home now." Willow whispered huskily. </p>

<p>"Oh no you don't." Buffy stated firmly. "Dance first, home later." </p>

<p>She turned and pulled Willow to the front door of the Bronze. The door
man recognised them and let them in immediately. </p>

<p>As they entered the crowded club, Buffy surveyed the room, and spotted
Xander sitting with Cordelia holding hands across a table and gazing
into each others eyes. With Willow in tow Buffy pushed her way through
the crowd to their friends table. </p>

<p>"Hey guys!" Buffy yelled to be heard above the music and smiling when
the couple jumped in surprise. "What cha doin'?" </p>

<p>She had on her innocent 'who me' face as they sat down at the couples
table. When the waitress arrived Buffy and Willow ordered cokes then
Buffy grabbed Willows hand. </p>

<p>"Lets dance, babe." Buffy shouted and pulled Willow onto the dance
floor. </p>

<p>She pulled her red haired lover close, the two girls looked into each
others eyes, and began moving to the heavy throbbing beat of the music.
It was as if everyone else ceased to exist and the stars and planets
revolved around only them. </p>

<p>The lovers only stopped dancing long enough to get a drink of their
sodas then got right back on the dance floor. Willow hadn't danced this
much in her entire life, nor had she ever wanted to until there was
Buffy. </p>

<p>Finally after a particularly long slow dance the two lovers came out of
their trance enough to notice they were the center of attention, even
the employees were watching them. </p>

<p>It was then they realized how heavy and rapid their breathing had
become. They made their way back to the table where Xander was starring
at them slack jawed and Cordelia suggested they 'get a room'. </p>

<p>"Lets go home." Willow whispered huskily into Buffy's ear, then bit it
lightly to get her point across. </p>

<p>Buffy nodded. The girls finished off their drinks, said their good-byes,
and headed for the nearest exit. Laughing and enjoying the cool night
air after the steamy stuffy atmosphere of the club they held hands and
headed out in the direction of their home. </p>

<p>The route home took them by a poorly lit heavily wooded park that
adjoined the oldest of the towns many cemeteries. As they passed the
park, both girls stopped dead in their tracks when they both heard two
distinct terrified screams. They turned and looked at each other their
disappointment showing clearly in their eyes. </p>

<p>"No rest for the Chosen One, I guess." Buffy said sadly and shrugged. </p>

<p>"Or for her faithful soulmate." Willow added trying to lighten the mood.
Then putting on her resolve face she said. "I'm ready when you are." </p>

<p>"Couldn't do it without you." Buffy said caressing her friends cheek,
only to be interrupted by another scream. </p>

<p>"Let's go." Buffy turned and kicked a slat out of a near by park bench
and picked up the make shift stake, then took off running across the
park toward the screams. </p>

<p>As she ran after the much faster Slayer, Willow began chanting
protection spells. They crossed the park and entered the old cemetery,
running past the old tombstones and came around an old mausoleum where
Buffy came to a sliding halt. </p>

<p>Willow almost ran into the Slayer and was about to complain when she saw
the look on Buffy's face, following Buffy's gaze Willow saw why her
companion had stopped short. </p>

<p>On a small rise behind the old mausoleum tied to tall headstones was a
young couple that looked barely old enough to date. </p>

<p>Two rather nasty looking demons were tormenting their helpless victims.
They had already ripped all the couples clothes off, and judging by the
cuts and bruises covering their bodies, the demons had been torturing
the young boy and girl for quite a while before the Slayer had arrived. </p>

<p>Both of the innocent victims were fighting for air and looked pleadingly
at the Slayer, as if begging her to save them. </p>

<p>"Hello Slayer." a deep voice said from the shadows. "I almost lost
control of those two while we waited for you. I wanted you to see how
they die." </p>

<p>A tall gaunt vampire stepped from the shadows. As they watched, his face
took on the twisted demented visage of the demon within him. He raised
his arm then clenched his hand into a fist. At that signal, the vampires
restraining the demons let them go. </p>

<p>The two blood crazed demons attacked their defenseless victims, ripping
their living bodies into small shreds. The couples screams of terror and
agony filled the night air, slicing into Buffy's ears, etching their
final tortures onto her soul. </p>

<p>While Buffy and Willow watched in helpless horror, as the demons
murdered the couple, several more vampires stepped out of the shadows to
join their leader. Before the girls realized it they were surrounded by
their enemies. </p>

<p>"Buffy, they're gone." Willow whispered and looked around nervously at
the distinctly unfriendly circle of vampires. "And I think we're in
trouble." </p>

<p>"I'd say you might be right Wills." Buffy said, losing the look of
horror and replacing it with the cold calculating rage of the Slayer.
"Come on you useless blood suckers, it's time for you to die." </p>

<p>With an impatient growl, Buffy attacked the nearest vampire, dusting him
almost before any of his companions even realized the fight was on. </p>

<p>The rest became a blur of kicks and punches with the occasional sound of
a stake piercing undead flesh. Willow was casting protective shields
around herself and Buffy. </p>

<p>Several of the vampires were thrown back into the tombstones smashing
several bones. Often there were more injuries than the vampires
supernatural healing could fix before sunrise, causing them to retreat
back to their lairs. </p>

<p>Some were hit with one of Willows binding spells and found themselves
held in one spot so the Slayer could dust them without any trouble. </p>

<p>At this point in the fight, Willow was attacked by powerful dark bolts
of mystical energy. Some of it she was able to dissipate, but most of it
she deflected towards the attacking vampires. Every time one of the
bolts hit a vampire it disappeared in a puff of smoke. </p>

<p>The battle wore on and Buffy was nearing the limit of her reserves. She
could feel herself slowing down. She stumbled slightly and found herself
being slowly being beaten back by the seemingly endless onslaught of
vampires. </p>

<p>Buffy was beginning to fear that she and Willow would be dead very soon.
She knew none of the vamps had the guts to turn the Slayer or her witch
lover. </p>

<p>Suddenly Buffy felt strength flowing back into her, energizing her body
and renewing her will to fight. She looked back over her shoulder and
Willow gave her a weak smile. Buffy knew Willow was using their
spiritual bond to give a portion of her energy to the Slayer. </p>

<p>Buffy stepped up her attack, knowing that Willow had drained most of her
reserves to support her. The Slayer knew it wouldn't be long before
Willow would be unable to function at any but the most basic levels. </p>

<p>Finally only four vampires remained and the Eastern horizon was
beginning to lighten with the promise of the coming dawn. Buffy's heart
was pounding like a jackhammer, and her breath was coming in ragged
gasps. </p>

<p>She knew her clothes were ruined from the blood, sweat and rips
resulting from the fight. She had several deep cuts that were still
bleeding freely. </p>

<p>The determined blonde fell back a step hoping to lure one of her
opponents out. Buffy caught a movement out of the corner of her eye.
Spinning to face it, she saw Willow collapse to the ground. </p>

<p>"WILLS!" Buffy cried out fearing the worst.
She took up a stance over her mate determined to defend her love to the
death, if necessary. </p>

<p>Seeing one of their opponents go down and the other fall back to a
defensive position, the vampires took the opportunity to attack. Finding
some reserve strength
Buffy hadn't realized she possessed, the slayer attacked and within
seconds had reduced her opponents by two swirling dust clouds. </p>

<p>In a final desperate effort Buffy tried to stand and face her remaining
attackers but having depleted her strength beyond its limits, the
exhausted Slayer fell to one knee. Try as she might the tiny blonde
could only brace herself to sell her life and that of her lover dearly
before falling to the seeming inevitable. </p>

<p>Seeing the apparent weakness of their seemingly indomitable opponent,
the final two vampires sensed a possibility of the defeat of the
legendary Slayer. With a roar of certain victory, the two undead
warriors launched their attack on their obviously defenseless victims. </p>

<p>Then, just as the two beasts were launching their attack, the clearing
lit up with an amazingly intense white light that seemed to appear out
of no where. </p>

<p>Both vampires disappeared in flames as Buffy watched in complete
amazement. Sensing the benevolence of the power Buffy allowed herself to
collapse next to her slowly recovering partner. She wondered where the
last minute reprieve came from, then a smirk came to her face as her
mind filled with a familiar voice. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;You have fought well Slayer.&lt;&gt; the voice of Lugh commended her. &lt;&gt;I
hope my assistance is not an insult, but I thought you could use the
rest.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>"No insult at all my friend." the tired girl said under her breath. "I
take it Morrigan and Brigit are there too." </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Of course they are my child.&lt;&gt; Lugh assured her. &lt;&gt;Their thoughts are
never far from you, as are mine. We sensed your distress and, as it
isn't your time to cross, I came to your aid. Normally this is not
allowed, but this time the others let me.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Buffy started to question Lugh on his comment but he stopped her. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;You are in no further danger my child.&lt;&gt; the Druids deep soothing
voice reassured the exhausted girl. &lt;&gt;Care for your beloved Sorceress.
She has defended you beyond any of our expectations. Only Brigit and
Morrigan foresaw her courage and love for you. They are justly proud of
you both and send their love.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>"Tell them that we return their feelings." Buffy answered and took a
deep cleansing breath. "Will we see you again Lugh, we miss you all a
lot." </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Of course my child.&lt;&gt; the voice of Lugh told her. &lt;&gt;We are bound
together as if by blood, we are never far. Now be off with you. When you
return to your sanctuary report all to your watcher, he will help you
face your coming trials.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Not sensing any other threat, and knowing that Lugh was never wrong,
Buffy knelt down and pulled Willows limp body into her arms. </p>

<p>"Wills baby talk to me." Buffy said quietly, panic and concern making
her voice quiver. "Come on sweetheart. I can feel your heart beating. I
know you're in there. Please Wills don't leave me like this. I need you.
Wills, please speak to me. I love you, Wills." </p>

<p>Buffy was crying in fear that somehow her lover had been injured
seriously. </p>

<p>"I love you too." Willow whispered weakly. "I'm okay, baby. Don't cry. I
just need to shut down for a while and recharge right now so I can't
move on my own right now so I guess I stay here and you get to watch.
Aren't you the lucky one." </p>

<p>"No probs Wills, I am the lucky one, I have you." Buffy said softly,
caressing the red heads cheek, her relief renewing her strength. "Better
yet, why don't I carry you home?" </p>

<p>Gathering the semi-conscious red head in her arms, Buffy turned towards
home. Tired and injured, she slowly made her way to the one place she
felt completely safe, and was soon approaching the front door of Giles'
townhouse. </p>
