<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 11 -->

<p>"It's about time you showed up".</p>
		<p>Brooke stood and met Sam who had just walked through the door.</p>
		<p>"I've been waiting for you".</p>
		<p>She held up her keys.</p>
		<p>"We're going for a drive".</p>
		<p>Without further explanation, Brooke walked out, leaving Sam to stare after her in in confusion.</p>
		<p>"Aye, aye, Captain", she muttered, shutting the door behind her.</p>
		<p>Making herself comfortable in the passenger seat, Sam turned the radio on and glanced at the blonde beside her.</p>
		<p>"Are you going to tell me where we're going?"</p>
		<p>"You'll just have to wait and see". Brooke replied, backing out of the driveway.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>They had been driving in comfortable silence, both content to just listen to the radio.</p>
		<p>Switching stations, Sam paused as she came across a song she hadn't heard in a while.</p>
		<p><i>He's everything you want</i></p>
		<p><i>He's everything you need</i></p>
		<p><i>He's everything inside of you</i></p>
		<p><i>That you wish you could be</i></p>
		<p><i>He says all the right things</i></p>
		<p><i>At exactly the right time</i></p>
		<p><i>But he means nothing to you</i></p>
		<p><i>And you don't know why</i></p>
		<p><i>You're waiting for someone </i></p>
		<p><i>To put you together</i></p>
		<p><i>Waiting for someone </i></p>
		<p><i>To push you away</i></p>
		<p><i>There's always another</i></p>
		<p><i>Wound to discover</i></p>
		<p><i>There's always something more</i></p>
		<p><i>You'd wish he'd say</i></p>
		<p><i>He's everything you want</i></p>
		<p><i>He's everything you need</i></p>
		<p><i>He's everything inside of you</i></p>
		<p><i>That you wish you could....</i></p>
		<p>Sam couldn't take it anymore. She lunged forward and quickly changed stations.</p>
		<p>"Hey! I like that song!" Brooke said, shooting Sam a look.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well I don't." Sam replied, turning away.</p>
		<p>Not wanting to make an issue of it, Brooke kept silent and continued driving.</p>
		<p><i>I thought that love was only true in fairytales</i></p>
		<p>"You even think of touching that dial and I swear you'll be walking home", Brooke threatened as Smashmouth's ''I'm A Believer" came over the radio.</p>
		<p><i>Meant for someone else </i></p>
		<p><i>But not for me</i></p>
		<p><i>Love was out to get me</i></p>
		<p><i>That's the way it seemed</i></p>
		<p><i>Disappointment haunted all my dreams</i></p>
		<p>Sam smiled. "Don't worry, I love this song."</p>
		<p><i>And then I saw her face</i></p>
		<p><i>Now I'm a believer</i></p>
		<p><i>Not a trace</i></p>
		<p><i>Of doubt in my mind</i></p>
		<p><i>I'm in love</i></p>
		<p>Brooke grinned, and began singing with the radio.</p>
		<p>"Ooooooooooo! Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!"</p>
		<p>Sam laughed.</p>
		<p><i>I'm a believer </i></p>
		<p><i>I couldn't leave her </i></p>
		<p><i>If I tried</i></p>
		<p>Brooke turned the volume up.</p>
		<p><i>I thought love was more or less a given thing</i></p>
		<p><i>The more I gave the less I got </i></p>
		<p><i>Oh yeah</i></p>
		<p><i>What's the use in trying</i></p>
		<p><i>All you get is pain</i></p>
		<p><i>When I wanted sunshine</i></p>
		<p><i>I got rain</i></p>
		<p>"Come on Sam! Sing it with me!" Brooke cried, bouncing around in her seat.</p>
		<p><i>And then I saw her face</i></p>
		<p><i>Now I'm a believer</i></p>
		<p><i>Not a trace</i></p>
		<p><i>Of doubt in my mind</i></p>
		<p><i>I'm in love</i></p>
		<p>"Ooooooooooo! Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!" Brooke sang, shooting Sam a look, who just laughed in response.</p>
		<p><i>I'm a believer </i></p>
		<p><i>I couldn't leave her </i></p>
		<p><i>If I tried</i></p>
		<p><i>What's the use in trying</i></p>
		<p><i>All you get is pain</i></p>
		<p><i>When I wanted sunshine</i></p>
		<p>"I got raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain!" Brooke continued singing loudly, causing Sam to laugh harder.</p>
		<p><i>And then I saw her face</i></p>
		<p><i>Now I'm a believer</i></p>
		<p><i>Not a trace</i></p>
		<p><i>Of doubt in my mind</i></p>
		<p><i>I'm in love</i></p>
		<p>This time Sam joined in. "Oooooooooooo! Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!"</p>
		<p>Brooke shot Sam a surprised look, then laughed.</p>
		<p><i>I'm a believer</i></p>
		<p><i>I couldn't leave her </i></p>
		<p><i>If I tried</i></p>
		<p>Sam and Brooke grinned at each other, preparing themselves for the big finale.</p>
		<p><i>Then I saw her face</i></p>
		<p><i>Now I'm a believer</i></p>
		<p><i>Not a trace</i></p>
		<p><i>Of doubt in my mind</i></p>
		<p><i>Now I'm a believer</i></p>
		<p>"YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH!" They yelled, dancing in their seats.</p>
		<p><i>Now I'm believer</i></p>
		<p><i>Then I saw her face</i></p>
		<p><i>Now I'm a believer</i></p>
		<p><i>Not a trace</i></p>
		<p><i>Of doubt in my mind</i></p>
		<p><i>I'm a believer...</i></p>
		<p>They sat back with huge grins on their faces, as the station went to an ad break.</p>
		<p>"Don't think I didn't notice you laughing at me. My voice isn't that bad!" Brooke said, pretending to be offended.</p>
		<p>Sam smirked. "I wasn't laughing with you, Brooke. I was laughing at you".</p>
		<p>Brooke smiled. "Well, that's good to know".</p>
		<p>She paused.</p>
		<p>"Hey!" She cried, when she realised what Sam had said. "That's it! Get out of my car!"</p>
		<p>Sam laughed. "Actually, you've got a pretty good voice".</p>
		<p>Brooke gave Sam her best smirk. "Well, what can I say? I'm a woman of many talents".</p>
		<p>She wiggled her eyebrows, leering at the brunetter beside her.</p>
		<p>Sam blushed, then decided to get her own back.</p>
		<p>"What's the point of having such skills if there is no audience to appreciate them?" Sam wondered out aloud.</p>
		<p>Brooke shot her a questioning glance.</p>
		<p>"I mean, you should try them out on me sometime", Sam answered innocently.</p>
		<p>Brooke nearly swerved off the road.</p>
