<!-- Trick or Treat \ Part 2 -->

<p>Seven of Nine was down in engineering working on a console off to the right
of the warp core well away from any of the crew. It had been a couple of days
since that staff meeting in which Captain Janeway had made the Halloween party
mandatory. After several long extensive conversations with Miss Naomi Wildman,
Seven had finally picked out the costume she was to wear and replicated it that
morning with the help of the doctor. As it was, Seven did not want to go to
this party, but now it seemed she had to wear a costume as well, which would
only bring more attention to her. Something she wished to avoid if at all
possible, but in this case it seemed all attempts to do so would be futile.</p>

<p>&quot;Irrelevant human holiday.&quot; Seven cursed in her own borg way.</p>

<p>&quot;I take it you're dreading this party as much as I am.&quot; B'Elanna
said as she came to stand right next to the borg. Seven turned to face B'Elanna
and saw a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. &quot;If I didn't know any
better I'd say that was the borg equivalent of a curse but of course borg don't
curse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are correct Lieutenant, that was not a curse but I am also no
longer borg.&quot; Seven smirked as she played word games with the Lieutenant.
Ever since that away mission in which B'Elanna was partially assimilated the
two women had seemed to come to an understanding. B'Elanna began to realize how
wrong she was for blaming Seven for being a drone when she really had no
control over it. Even Tuvok could not resist the call of the collective and
Tuvok was the most controlled person she knew. Seven on the other hand had
realized how much she and B'Elanna were alike. Not only did they share the
experience of being assimilated but they also shared many like qualities.
Stubbornness, arrogance, intelligence, physical strength, hiding one's
emotions, and even passion when it came to protecting their collective. And
some time over the past month both women realized they felt some attraction
toward the other. They both connected at some level, unlike B'Elanna's
relationship with Paris where it was only passion and no understanding. But she
and Seven had that and more. Even when they hated each other they could still
trust each other with their lives, they were also brutally honest and still
managed to have a certain respect for the other. They were equals; fire versus
fire; passion versus passion. A friendship was blossoming but there was the
potential for more.</p>

<p>Seven had noticed that the two of them had been standing there looking into
each other's eyes for quite some time now and decided to break the silence in
her usual abrupt manner.</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard from several members of the crew that you have terminated
your marriage to Lieutenant Paris. Are you functioning adequately?&quot; Seven
never thought that Lieutenant Torres should be mated to Tom Paris for he was
not at all suitable and was relieved to hear of their breakup. But you won't
hear Seven admit to that.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; B'Elanna was thrown off by the sudden change in topic.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Seven tried again. Torres took a few moments to
gather her thoughts before answering that loaded question.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I am, Seven. Why do I look terrible or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the contrary, you seem to be adapting well. I only wished to
'return the favor'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What favor?&quot; Now B'Elanna was even more confused.</p>

<p>&quot;During my illness you attempted to comfort me by talking and listening
to me. I only wished to offer you the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... well... gee thanks, Seven, but I really am fine. I suppose it
just wasn't meant to be. I mean we had all the passion and perhaps some love
but none of the understanding, trust, honesty, or loyalty a relationship should
have. A little difference can be good for a relationship but too much
isn't.&quot; B'Elanna stopped talking immediately after she realized she had
just described her relationship with Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. If you ever do need to talk, know that I am willing to
listen.&quot; B'Elanna nodded dumbly and walked away leaving Seven to wonder if
B'Elanna had been referring to their relationship or if she was just being
general. Seven found that at times like these, hope comes in very handy.</p>

<p>The following night was the party where everyone was suppose to relax and
have a fun time but earlier that afternoon was anything but fun. Several
engineering relays had blown out due to a faulty replicated part being put in,
not to mention the undue stress Voyager had been under lately. Seven was again
working in engineering and decided to help by repairing the parts herself but
nothing with Seven is ever that simple. Not only was she going to repair the
faulty relays but improve them as well. This of course lead to a heated
argument between Seven and the Chief who didn't approve of the improvements. At
one point the engineering team began to duck because they thought the two would
come to blows. But in the end they somehow managed a compromise, proving to
themselves and others that, yes they can still be very passionate about what
they do, but they now had a new understanding of the other.</p>

<p>Later that evening, Voyager was orbiting a moon in an uninhabited star
system and running on a skeleton crew. Everyone who was not on duty was at the
Halloween party being held in the holodeck. The holodeck was turned into a
great big mansion which the guests could explore for a frightening good time.
Entering a huge set of double doors you entered the main hall where a few
guests were milling about. Directly in front was a huge marble staircase
leading upstairs and to the rest of the house but the majority of the people
seemed to be in the great dining hall off to the left of the staircase. Walking
inside you could see four long tables almost the length of the entire room
where some were seated eating dinner and talking. Others were scattered
throughout the decorated room talking in groups generally having a great time
all dressed up in various costumes. Music played in the background ranging from
spooky sounds to fun music like the monster mash. Off towards the right center
of the room was the Captain. She happened to be dressed up as a cat in a black
skin-tight outfit complete with the tail, whiskers, and claws, looking like she
was ready to pounce. Next to her stood a mummified Neelix wrapped completely
from head to toe in toilet paper. (His research into Halloween showed that toilet
paper was used very often but he didn't know it wasn't for that purpose)</p>

<p>&quot;Neelix, again, you have out done yourself. This place is great and I'm
having a lot of fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why thank you, Captain, but I can't take all the credit. Mr. Kim
designed the program I only supplied him with the idea.&quot; Neelix blushed.</p>

<p>Harry who was standing close by heard the comment and decided to join the
conversation. He walked himself over to the two officers but as soon as he got
there he looked as if he were about to faint. Poor Harry decided to get dressed
up as a werewolf but put on too much fur. He felt as if he were on a desert
planet with all that fur on. 'How do animals survive this?'</p>

<p>&quot;I may have designed the program, Neelix but I couldn't have done it
without your help. And by the way I'm having such a good time too. I hear I
have Naomi to thank for that. Where is she anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>Neelix pointed to a table where Naomi and her mother sat eating their
dinner. Samantha Wildman was dressed up as the devil and her daughter an angel.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, isn't that suppose to be the other way around?&quot; Tom
suggested as he joined the group.</p>

<p>Tom had just arrived in his Elvis (later years) costume. Well, at least he
knew what he was suppose to be, everyone else just kept asking what kind of
monster he was. Tom even had a guitar to go along with the costume but nobody
knew what that was either.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice costume, ma'am.&quot; Tom said as he eyed his captain. Only he
would be so brave or so foolish. &quot;So where's the Commander? I'd like to
see what he's wearing too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's over there. See the Cowardly Lion?&quot; the Captain pointed.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, how come everyone knows who the Commander is but no one knows who
I am?&quot; Tom whined.</p>

<p>&quot;Because the Wizard of Oz is still a classic whereas The Elvis Lives
Theory died about 3 centuries ago.&quot; B'Elanna joined in momentarily
forgetting the supposed awkwardness about being around Tom.</p>

<p>Tom turned around to see a smiling B'Elanna and couldn't help but smile
back. Not only was she joking around with him but she was wearing an old amazon
costume leaving very little to the imagination. But then things got quiet all
of a sudden with no one knowing what to say or do. Fortunately or
unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Jennifer Delaney showed up
dressed as a harem girl and asked Elvis to dance. Tom nodded okay and the two
left the group.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what's up with the costume, Maquis. Not that it doesn't look good
on you.&quot; Harry decided to break the ice.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, since this was an old earth holiday and I'm a warrior I decided
to dress up as an old earth warrior.&quot; B'Elanna joked, relieved for the
tension breaker.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we're still missing three of the senior staff. Tuvok, Seven, and
the Doctor. I hope everything is okay.&quot; Janeway commented.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, I saw Tuvok a few minutes ago. He's the one under the sheet.
Suppose to be a ghost. Very simplistic but at least he got dressed up.&quot;
B'Elanna pointed out.</p>

<p>Suddenly gasps were heard throughout the room and the group noticed everyone
staring at the entrance. Turning they saw the Doctor standing there dressed up
as a 1920's gangster with Seven on his arm. But what had shocked everyone was
Seven's costume. Seven was dressed up in a very sexy form fitting black
spaghetti strap dress showing off every curve. It hung down to the mid thigh
showing off Seven's long legs and had an impossibly low neckline.</p>

<p>She also had on a pair of black high heeled shoes and wore her hair in curls
cascading down her back. To complete the ensemble Seven wore a diamond studded
necklace and ankle bracelet. Her face was painted white and she sported a nice
set of fangs. All in all a heart stopping site, at least for B'Elanna that is.</p>

<p>&quot;A vampire&quot; B'Elanna whispered almost afraid to break the mood.</p>

<p>Seven herself was beginning to feel uncomfortable with all the attention and
began to regret coming. The Doctor felt her stiffen and patted her on the arm
for encouragement. Seven thought back to the Doctor's lessons and remembered
that humor is usually used as a tension breaker.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I have found a new way to assimilate you all.&quot; Seven
grinned showing her fangs which got the expected laughter in return. Soon
enough everyone went back to what they were doing.</p>

<p>Other than Seven's entrance that evening, the night went by uneventfully.
Everyone had a good time eating, laughing, and even getting drunk. B'Elanna had
stayed away from Seven for the most part during the night afraid that she may
do or say something that Seven would regret later. Seven for her part actually
mingled with the crowd, talking and smiling. It seemed that Seven really did
have a good time and B'Elanna just enjoyed watching Seven smile.</p>

<p>It was now almost two o'clock in the morning and just about everyone had
left for the night. Naomi and her mother left about 3 hours ago with Tuvok,
Chakotay, and the Doctor shortly after. The Captain stayed an extra hour but
that was it for her. No one noticed when Tom left or even wondered where
Jennifer had gotten off to and so it was just Harry, B'Elanna, and Seven left
as well as a few drunks too tired to move.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you take Seven home and I'll close up the place.&quot; But
before B'Elanna had time to respond Harry was off rounding up the leftovers.
Seven was sitting by herself with a smile on her face sipping at her drink.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, are you drunk?&quot; B'Elanna asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I was just replaying the evening over and enjoying myself again. I
do not remember ever having so much fun at a social gathering before. I find I
do not wish this night to be over.&quot; Seven answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Neither do I, Seven but I do have to get you back to the cargo bay
now, so come on.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna assisted Seven in standing even though it was unnecessary but
neither one was going to mention that. B'Elanna kept her hand on Seven's waist
as she guided her out of the holodeck and to the turbo lift. The walk was silent
but not uncomfortably so. About halfway to the lift the ship was rocked and
engulfed in a blinding white light. Seven was knocked to the ground as B'Elanna
was temporarily blinded. As fast as it came it was over just as quickly. A
yellow alert was sounded and B'Elanna once again grabbed a hold of Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on. Lets get down to engineering and find out what the hell just
happened.&quot;</p>
