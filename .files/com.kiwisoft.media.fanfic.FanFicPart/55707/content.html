<!-- Halloween \ Part One -->

<p>"Should we do one of those nasty food things like peeled grapes as eyeballs? And we need to get some dry ice to do a cauldron effect for the punchbowl. Oh! We should get a tub so we can do bobbing for apples." Sam excitedly wrote down her ideas in her notebook. She and Brooke sat in the kitchen discussing their Halloween plans.</p>
<p>Brooke grimaced. "I always thought bobbing for apples was kinda gross. After the first person, it's backwash city."</p>
<p>"No bobbing? We have to have bobbing," Sam cried, her eyebrows up near her hairline.</p>
<p>Brooke snickered at her expression. "Only if I get to be first."</p>
<p>"Done." Sam wrote it down. Brooke goes first, next to Bobbing for Apples. She grinned as Brooke laughed at her. "So, have you decided what you're going to be?"</p>
<p>"Trinity, from the Matrix," Brooke replied.</p>
<p>"Good one," Sam said, nodding, her throat tightening at the thought of Brooke in all that shiny pleather, or vinyl, or whatever it was.</p>
<p>Brooke and Sam's parents had consented to their throwing a Halloween Party at their house, and had even promised to stay out of sight for the duration, as long as things didn't get out of hand. For their part, Sam and Brooke had promised to not only get along themselves, but that their groups of friends would behave civilly towards each other as well. The parentals had also requested some time put in doing housework, but had yet to collect on that part of the bargain.</p>
<p>Actually, Sam reflected, she and Brooke had been getting along pretty well since the prom, back in May. The events of that night had caused a subtle shift in the relationship between them, and the two had grown closer over the summer. Sam still couldn't say why she charged like a linebacker into Brooke that night, throwing them both clear of an oncoming car barreling straight towards her erstwhile enemy. She didn't think; she just did it. Sam had been winded and Brooke had been out cold for a few minutes, probably from Sam landing on top of her. Thankfully the only real damage sustained was to their dresses and the heel of Sam's shoe.</p>
<p>Once the excitement died down, and she, Brooke, and Harrison realized there was still the prom to go to, Sam gracefully ceded defeat to Brooke and watched as the pair left to fulfill their requirement of high school rite of passage. She admitted to herself that she was only competing with Brooke, and didn't really want to date Harrison. The whole thing left a bad taste in her mouth, and since then she had tried not to succumb to her petty urges when it came to Brooke.</p>
<p>"So is Harrison going to be Neo?" Sam asked. "That would be pretty cute."</p>
<p>Brooke looked at her strangely. "Sam, Harrison and I broke up last week. I thought you knew."</p>
<p>"No! I had no idea. Are you all right? What happened?" Sam was shocked at this news; she thought everything was more than okay between the two. But then, she considered, she didn't really talk to Harrison that much anymore, and Carmen and Lily tiptoed around the subject of Brooke and Harrison's relationship, out of some misguided sympathy for her feelings. The truth was that she was fine with their relationship, not that she could convince anyone of it. She did sometimes wish that she still had Harrison as a friend but the fallout of their little power play last spring had made him too uncomfortable to keep Sam as his friend while he was romantically attached to Brooke. She was troubled that Brooke hadn't thought it important to tell her herself. She had thought they were becoming closer.</p>
<p>"I'm okay," Brooke said, a little tentatively. "I was sort of surprised you hadn't said something sooner. Now I know why you didn't, I guess." She leveled her eyes over to Sam's as she explained the rest. "It had been coming on for a while, so neither of us was really surprised, but I was the one who actually put a fork in it. We just sort of fizzled out after awhile. He's a great guy and I still like him a lot. I just don't love him."</p>
<p>"God, Brooke, I'm so sorry," Sam apologized, though not really knowing why. "I really thought you two could be happy together."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did too," she answered wistfully. "But now this leaves the field open for you, Sam," Brooke looked at Sam with a sad smile.</p>
<p>"What? Brooke, I told you months ago that there was no part of me that still wanted Harrison, and I meant it." Sam exclaimed, frustrated. "I can't believe that you would think me capable of waiting around for your relationship to fail, so I could swoop in and take over. God! I guess that shows what you really think of me, doesn't it?" She asked, as she got up from the table and stalked out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Sam, wait! I'm sorry! I didn't really-" Brooke sighed as she watched Sam leave the room. She had really put on her mint-flavored shoes this time.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke trudged up the stairs, cursing her foolishness. There was some part of her that truly thought that Sam had been waiting for her and Harrison to break up. It would explain why Sam had been so sweet to her since the prom. There had hardly been an uncivil word between them for months and she had grudgingly grown to enjoy and depend on their fledgling friendship. She couldn't help having her suspicions, could she? She just should have kept them to herself. Why did she even care if Sam was after Harrison? It was of no concern to her now. Then why did she feel ambivalent about the thought of Sam and Harrison together? Not ambivalent, upset.</p>
<p>She stood in front of Sam's room and knocked, hoping to mend fences before bedtime. Sam didn't answer, so Brooke opened the door a few inches to see Sam sitting on her bed with her headphones on, her Physics book open in front of her. She looked up when she saw Brooke and then quickly looked down again. She waved her in with one hand and removed her headphones with the other. Brooke could faintly hear the sound of Ani Difranco whining about something or other, but now was not the time to annoy Sam about her taste in music.</p>
<p>"Did you understand any of that stuff about calculating vectors that Glass was talking about today?" Sam asked, flipping the pages of her Physics book, "'Cause I totally didn't." It seems Ms. Glass was a triple threat in the sciences and had taken over teaching Physics to this year's crop of seniors.</p>
<p>The subject of Physics momentarily disconcerted Brooke, as she had her mind set on apologizing. "Yeah, kinda... Look Sam, I'm really sorry I said that about you and Harrison. I really don't think that-"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it," Sam interrupted. "Whatever. I thought I was succeeding in turning over a new leaf, but I guess I'm kidding myself if not even you think I've changed."</p>
<p>"I don't know why you think you need to turn over a new leaf," Brooke quoted the air at this, "there was nothing wrong with your old leaf."</p>
<p>"I don't know how you can say that, Brooke." Sam closed her textbook and looked up at the girl standing over her bed. "I blindly tried to sabotage your relationship just because I had to win. I ruined a friendship with Harrison for the sake of competing with you. And let's not forget the mess I made with George."</p>
<p>"Well, you can't do penance forever. And that hair shirt you're wearing is so last spring, and doesn't do a thing for your figure." Brooke tried to jolly Sam out of her mood. "And Sam, sabotaging my relationship is a moot point now, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Maybe. What happened, Brooke? You guys were, like, disgustingly happy."</p>
<p>Brooke's face became flushed and she grew visibly uncomfortable, fidgeting with her shirt cuff. "I really don't want to talk about it right now. Can we just skip it and get back to Halloween?"</p>
<p>Sam shook herself out of her mood. "Only if you stop standing there like a goon and sit down," she smiled.</p>
<p>"Well, I have to keep my distance from Ani's caterwauling. I can hear that screeching from clear across the room," Brooke giggled, knowing full well the response she was about to get.</p>
<p>"Get out!" Sam pretended to be outraged, and pointed to the door. "If you would stop listening to that nutball Mariah Carey for two seconds you might be able to appreciate the genius that is Ani."</p>
<p>Now it was Brooke's turn to be outraged. "I so regret telling you that! I only like that one song. You are never going to forget it, are you?"</p>
<p>"Nope. Blackmail material filed away for future use. It's only her worst song, too. And you question my musical taste," Sam tsked, shaking her head and grinning like a fool. She was bipolar, she knew it. It was only moments ago she was in the blackest mood imaginable, and now she couldn't remember what had gotten her upset. Oh yeah -- she remembered. She'd think about it later.</p>
<p>Brooke flopped onto the bed. "All right, let's hear 'the genius that is Ani.'" Air quotes, again. Sam didn't know why she detested anyone else using air quotes, but found it endearing when Brooke did it. Without getting up, Sam pulled the cord of her headphones out of the jack in her stereo across the room and the sound of acoustic guitar suddenly filled the air. Unfortunately for anyone wishing to make a convert, Ani started inarticulately moaning along with the bridge.</p>
<p>"Genius, huh? I think I'll stick with Mariah," Brooke guffawed at the look of dismay that crossed Sam's face. Quickly changing the subject she asked, "So what are you going to be for Halloween?"</p>
<p>"Not a clue," Sam confessed. "Carmen and I are going shopping tomorrow to try and figure out something. Maybe we'll do something together, but not something stupid like the M&amp;M dudes or anything. It has to be cool."</p>
<p>"You really get into Halloween, don't you?" Brooke asked appraisingly.</p>
<p>"Well, yeah! It's the only night of the year you can really be something or someone else." Sam said, excitedly.</p>
<p>"We didn't hang out on Halloween last year," Brooke said. "What was your costume?"</p>
<p>"Um, Ompf lumfpf," Sam muttered behind her hand, trying to dissemble. "Don't make me say it, it's so embarrassing!"</p>
<p>"Come on, MacPherson, spill!" Brooke ordered, sitting up and pointing in Sam's face.</p>
<p>Sam swatted away Brooke's finger and said, "Okay! Lily, Carmen, and I were stuck and didn't have any ideas so we were Oompa Loompas." She watched Brooke start cackling with glee. "But we were really good Oompa Loompas! Until that orange makeup started getting everywhere and -"</p>
<p>"Tell me you have pictures," Brooke demanded.</p>
<p>"No pictures survived to tell the tale of that night," Sam stated, making a mental note to tell Carmen never to give up the goods.</p>
<p>"Ah, nuts! I would have loved to see that. How is it that we lived in the same house last year and I didn't know you were an Oompa Loompa for Halloween?" Brooke asked, honestly puzzled.</p>
<p>"Well all I know about your costume last year was that it was white." Sam recalled. "What were you?"</p>
<p>"Nicole, Mary Cherry and I did a group thing, too. We were all Gwyneth Paltrow." Brooke laid back down and put her hands up, doing a 'picture this' kind of thing. "My costume was the best if I do say so. I was the Gwyneth of Shakespeare in Love, the white Elizabethan wedding dress from the end, you know? When she went and did Juliet before leaving with Mr. Darcy?" Brooke glanced at Sam, caught up in the telling of her story. "Nicole was the Gwyneth of Hard Eight, she was clearly suited for the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold-plate."</p>
<p>"And which Gwyneth was Mary Cherry?" asked Sam, now extremely curious.</p>
<p>"Well, there wasn't much left at that point so she had to be the Gwyneth from Shallow Hal. She wasn't too pleased. But I do have pictures! Mary Cherry's whole costume doesn't even fit in some of them," Brooke enthused.</p>
<p>"But you're not doing the group thing this year," Sam said, laughing at the thought of Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"No. I wanted a change," Brooke said, vaguely.</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too. No Oompa Loompas this year for me," Sam vowed.</p>
<p>Brooke started giggling again, the realized, "Hey, I've been listening to Ani for twenty minutes! I've got to get out of here. Goodnight, Sam."</p>
<p>"Get out!" Sam raged, almost hitting Brooke with a pillow as the door closed behind her.</p>
