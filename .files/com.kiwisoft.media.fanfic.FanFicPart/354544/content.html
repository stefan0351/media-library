<!-- Realms \ Part 17 -->

<p>Fey pulled a clear gem from her pouch and turned a way from the
group.  The immortal then began chanting causing the gem to glow,
after a few moments of this a brilliant light shot from the gem and
struck the wall she was facing and formed a passage way, "Quickly
gather up the fallen warriors and follow me through the portal, We
are running out of time," Commanded Fey.</p>

<p>Faith scooped up Buffy in her arms as Giles carefully picked up
Willow.  The three of them quickly made their way to the
passageway, "Were are we taking them," nervously asked Giles.</p>

<p>"Fey saw the concern in the watchers eyes, "The passage way is a
portal to the middle Ethereal, it is to there we must travel if they
are to be saved."</p>

<p>The watcher gave Fey a quick glance before heading down the pathway,
with Faith and Tara closely behind him.  When the group emerged on
the other side they found themselves standing in a large room that
had several beds scattered throughout it and was filled with what
appeared to be various types of medical equipment.  Each bed had a
magical circle drawn around it and a small table next to it that was
covered with various spell components.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, We are in a healing room deep in the castle of
warrior Alexandria," Reassured Fey.  She looked Directly at
Faith, "Place the fallen Warrior on that bed, then lay down on the
one next to it, Fey then turned to Giles, "Place her in the bed next
to her beloved."</p>

<p>Faith stood next to the bed were Fey had told her to lay downn, she
took a quick look at the large bed that Buffy and Willow were lying
in before turning to Fey, "I want to help them, but I don't see how I
fit into this, I'm only a slayer."</p>

<p>Fey walked over to the slayer and put her hands on the brunette's
shoulders, "Child that is the very reason that you are the one who
can save them"</p>

<p>"I don't understand?"</p>

<p>"Her blood has been poisoned and it is killing the two of them.  The
only way to save them is a transfusion, and you are the only match."</p>

<p>Fey comfortingly placed her hands on Faiths shoulders," Child we are
standing within the Castle of Alexandria, keeper of the power of the
slayer.  You are just as much a child of hers as is the ultimate
slayer, the two of you share a proud and ancient lineage carried
throughout the ages by the powers of the Gods and Goddesses.  It is
through this that you are connected not only as comrades in arms but
as sisters, and like your sister you possess the rarest of all the
blood types, the one that holds the secrets of the slayers.  Through
your veins flows the power of the slayer and it is that blood that
will save them."</p>

<p>A tear rolled down Faiths cheek as she absorbed Feys words, for the
first time since she had been called the brunette had realized what
it means to be a slayer.  It didn't matter that her friend, no
sister, was a more powerful slayer than her, she still was a slayer
and part of something so grand that they are given their powers by
the heavens and watched over by the immortals. </p>

<p>Faith stepped back away from Fey and sat down on the smaller
bed, "Lets do it."</p>

<p>Fey smiled at the slayer, "Lay down child, Alexandria's healers will
be her shortly to prepare the equipment for the procedure, Fey slowly
looked over at Tara and motioned for her, "Come now child your
beloved needs you."</p>

<p>Tara nervously walked over to Faiths bed side and took a seat by the
brunette's side.  She squeezed Faiths hand and then began to gently
run her free hand through the brunettes' soft hair.  </p>

<p>Tara gazed at her girlfriend for a moment then looked to her age-old
mentor and friend, "Fey, I care for her deeply."</p>

<p>Fey could since the deep concern that racked Tara's voice, "I know
you do child, I also know that no matter what I say to you that your
mind will not be at ease until the transfusion is over and you can
see with your own eyes that she along with your friends are safe."</p>

<p>"But she is only one, I know of no spell that could possibly allow
for a safe transfusion with only one donor."</p>

<p>Fey almost chuckled at Tara's words but managed to hold it
back, "Sweet child just because you are unaware of such a spell does
not mean it doesn't exist, the healers have many magical items that
are kept her to aid in the healing process, it is one of these items
they are going to use on your beloved.  It will speed up her natural
healing ability so that her blood will rapidly replicate itself
during the transfusion."</p>

<p>Fey took a few steps away from the bed to make room for the several
healers who had quietly slipped in while she was talking to Faith and
Tara.</p>

<p>"Watcher, could you come with me, we would only be in the way here,
besides there is someone I would like you to meet."</p>

<p>Giles looked at the immortal, then over to the two beds where all his
surrogate daughters laid, then back to the immortal, "I would really
like to stay with them," softly wept Giles.</p>

<p>"They will be fine, the healers have been performing such task for
centuries.  You will best serve them by coming with me and seeing
that which no watcher has ever seen before."</p>
