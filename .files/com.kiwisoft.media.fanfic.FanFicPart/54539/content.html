<p>A light fog swirled around them as the Slayer and her chosen mate stalked
into the graveyard's oldest section.</p>

<p>&#34;For Goddess sake, Buffy,&#34; Willow complained. &#34;Why is it so hard for you to
tell me what's wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Let it go Wills,&#34; the obviously troubled blonde growled through clenched
teeth. &#34;Not every part of my life is open to discussion you know, or is that
too much to ask?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Fine!&#34; The witch snapped glaring back at her lover. &#34;All I want to do is
help you through these dreams, but if you are going to bite my head off
every time I try to talk to you then just forget it.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was about to make a sarcastic remark when her &#34;Slaydar&#34; started
tingling.</p>

<p>She stopped dead in her tracks and began scanning the surrounding area, her
eyes straining trying to penetrate the shadows trying to locate the danger
she sensed was near.</p>

<p>Knowing the meaning of her soulmate's sudden stop and feeling her anxiety
Willow froze where she was and waited for a signal from her companion.</p>

<p>Buffy's sensitive hearing picked up the sounds of a scuffle not too far off
to the right and she silently let her partner know as she headed toward the
noise. The sound led them to a heavily shadowed tree lined lane that
meandered lazily through the woods to a clearing lit up by the bright summer
half moon.</p>

<p>In the center of the clearing was a stone altar that was surrounded by six
chanting vampires, and on the altar was a young girl struggling to free
herself from the bonds that held her.</p>

<p>Examining the situation carefully, the Slayer came up with a plan of attack
that would draw the vamps away from the girl.  She just hoped it would give
Willow enough time to free the girl.</p>

<p>Indicating her intention to her partner, Buffy stepped out into the clearing
before Willow could protest her decision.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, guys.&#34; The Slayer called out, &#34;is this a private party or can anybody
join in?&#34;</p>

<p>Six very ugly faces turned to look at the intruder.  As Buffy had predicted
all six began advancing on her, forgetting their bound captive entirely.</p>

<p>As if on signal they rushed at the audacious blonde expecting her to run and
were caught by surprise when she stood her ground ready to fight.</p>

<p>Once the conflict began Willow used the shadows as cover to get around
behind the half dozen undead and hurried to the altar.  She was determined
to free the girl as quickly as possible so she could join her mate in he
fray.</p>

<p>Willow stealthily made her way to the alter and using her athame began
cutting the ropes that held the would be sacrifice. The brave young witch
had turned to lead the freed captive to safety, when an unnaturally strong
pair of hands suddenly grabbed her from behind. She turned her head as far
as she could to see what had grabbed her and saw that the cute young
brunette that was gone and in her place was a female vampire in full game
face.</p>

<p>Willow struggled, but was held fast in the vice-like grasp of the monster.
The vampire was smiling hideously at her in triumph. Willow immediately
tried to use magic to free herself, but just like in all the other ambushes,
some kind of strong dark power was protecting the Vampire.</p>

<p>&#34;I've got the witch.&#34; The vampire shouted victoriously. &#34;You can come out
now.&#34;</p>

<p>The first six vampires backed away from the Slayer as six more joined them.</p>

<p>&#34;We are one of Lord Kresis' elite corps,&#34; the apparent leader of the party
crowed to the stunned slayer.</p>

<p>&#34;You would not believe how much planing our master put into this ambush,&#34; he
continued. &#34;And now we have not only been able to trap the dreaded Slayer
but we have also successfully separated her from the witch for the first
time.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;To answer your question Slayer,&#34; another one of the vampires said laughing
triumphantly. &#34;This is a private party but don't worry, you and your bitch
are the guests of honor.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wouldn't you know it,&#34; Buffy quipped, with far more confidence than she
felt. &#34;I brought the party favors.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy pulled out two stakes from her belt and feeling that a good offense
was the best defense she attacked the nearest vampire in a whirling twist
planting the stake his long dead heart. As that one exploded in a cloud of
dust, the blonde blur moved on to her next target, all the while pushing the
fight toward the vampire that was holding her lover. She vowed that she
would save her beloved or die in the attempt.  The Slayer fought with a
ferocity far beyond anything she thought she was capable of doing.</p>

<p>The surprisingly sudden and vicious attack seemed to have unnerved the
vampires and it threw them into a panic.  The instructions from their leader
and all the training they received hadn't prepared them for the fury,
strength and speed that they faced in the blonde slayer.</p>

<p>As the vampire's leader tried regain control of his troops by having them
fall back and reform, the female vampire holding Willow made the mistake of
watching the fight.  Sensing her captor's distraction Willow began chanting
quietly under her breath, gathering powerful magiks.  The witch's hands
began to glow with a neon green--signaling the power Willow had built.</p>

<p>When Willow was sure she had gathered enough to break through whatever it
was shielding the unfortunate vampire that was imprisoning her, she let it
loose.  With a flash of incredibly intense green light the female vampire
disappeared.</p>

<p>No cloud of dust, no flames, no screams, the vampire was just gone.</p>

<p>Willow collapsed to her knees panting--she looked up to see that Buffy was
in it deep.  The remaining vampires had reformed and, now that they were
over their initial panic, were fighting like the elite guard they claimed to
be.</p>

<p>She staggered to her feet and rushed to her mate's aid. She didn't slow down
long enough to contemplate the meaning of the new range of her powers--all
she could think about was Buffy.</p>

<p>As she approached, Willow continued to chant and balls of powerful green
flames shot from her hands destroying any undead creature it touched. Things
slowed some when the witch joined the reason for her existence and turned to
guard the quickly tiring Slayer's back.</p>

<p>&#34;Good to see you, Wills,&#34; Buffy admitted panting heavily from her exertions.
&#34;I was beginning to think you were going to sit this one out.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What and let you have all these hot young vamps to yourself?&#34; Willow
quipped, knowing that her lover used humor to cover her fear that she was
going to loose her mate. &#34;I think not.&#34;</p>

<p>Now the only thing that worried the two defenders of humanity was that,
although they were fighting better than they ever had, they had now reached
the limit of their strength.  They were trembling with exhaustion and there
were still three vamps facing them.</p>

<p>&#34;Wills, I'm sorry...&#34; Buffy gasped, barely able to hold her arms up. &#34;I
don't... how...longer I can...hold on...it looks like I'm letting'
you...down again.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No...I can't ...accept that...we've got to... hold on&#34; Willow whispered out
of breath and strength herself. &#34;I won't ...let it end...now. I know if
we....&#34;</p>

<p>She could say no more as the abyss of total physical, mental exhaustion
swallowed her, and she collapsed in a heap. Even exhausted a faint green
aura surrounded the witch.</p>

<p>Buffy looked down at her fallen companion and felt tears of frustration
falling down her face. With fatalistic determination the devoted Slayer and
lover of the fallen Sorceress straddled the body of her mate ready to defend
them both from their enemies.</p>

<p>&#34;My love...&#34; Buffy panted, blinking the tears and sweat out of her eyes.
She knew this was the end but she was incapable of surrender because of
Willow. &#34;They. Won't... get to... you... with... out going... through... me&#34;</p>

<p>The first of the vampires launched itself at the weary blonde defender and
in a deadly dance of kicks, punches, leaps and spins the two fought.  The
Slayer was surprised at how much stamina she still had, but by the time her
dance partner was dusted there was nothing left.</p>

<p>Swaying unsteadily on her feet, her knees threatening to buckle, but
refusing the inevitable the Slayer looked even smaller than normal. Turning
slowly to face her last two adversaries the tiny blonde tried one last
insult.</p>

<p>&#34;Come on...vamps,&#34; Buffy shouted as loudly as she could and with as much
contempt as she could muster &#34;You haven't got the fangs to finish it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You bitch, we were going to do you quick,&#34; the lead vampire snarled
viciously. &#34;But now your smart mouth has convinced us to do you and your
witch slut nice and slow so we can enjoy every agonizing second of her
death.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Gods... don't you guys ever get...new...material?&#34; Buffy shot back and
braced herself for the attack that she knew must come.</p>

<p>A small smile crossed her lips as she felt a trickle of power coming into
her from Willow's unconscious form and saw the aura was a tiny bit brighter
but Buffy knew her beloved wouldn't be able to get enough strength in time
to help.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Good try sweetheart, &lt;&gt; Buffy projected to her soulmate hoping the
thoughts were reaching her. &lt;&gt;There just isn't time. I love you Willow. Now
and forever we will be together. &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>The petite blonde watched her antagonists waiting for them--prepared to go
down fighting.  She wanted to take both of the vampires with her hoping that
could possibly save her partner.</p>

<p>The two vamps began to circle her in opposite directions trying to draw the
Slayer off balance and failing, she was too well trained to fall for that.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Buffy felt a familiar red haze cloud her mind and vision.</p>

<p>The next thing she knew she was standing over her beloved Witch, in the
empty clearing.</p>

<p>She looked down at the peacefully sleeping redhead in confusion.  &lt;&gt; Where'd
the vamps go? &lt;&gt; She thought, searching the dark tree line for movement.</p>

<p>Again, with no warning the red haze pushed everything from the slayer's
mind--except the urgent need to get her beloved to the safety of their home.</p>

<p>Mind and body on the point of collapse Buffy picked up her unconscious lover
and started towards home.</p>

<p>As she gently placed the Witch on the bed--she thought she had no idea how
they made it.  She couldn't remember anything after she left the clearing.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;None of that matters, &lt;&gt; Buffy repeated the thought that formed in her
mind. &lt;&gt; You are safe.  She is safe, go to sleep now. &lt;&gt; And a red tinged
blackness filled the slayer's head....</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Countess Hela and her faithful servant Max slipped out of her hiding place
across from the slayer's townhouse unseen.</p>

<p>As they headed for her temporary home, she could tell that her loyal Max had
questions.  Since everything was going exactly as planed she felt benevolent
towards the human.</p>

<p>&#34;What is your question, Max?&#34; The Countess asked still humming a happy
demented little tune.</p>

<p>The insane little man looked at her adoring, &#34;Thank you for your kindness,
mistress.&#34; He started, she could see that he was carefully forming his
question.  &#34;You had them at your mercy, why did you not allow me to collect
them?&#34;</p>

<p>She laughed at his stupidity.  &#34;The slayer still struggles with her destiny
as my slave.  Her will must be completely broken for me to gain total
control of it.  If we had captured them tonight, I would never have been
able to gain power over her.  No, for me to own the slayer, she must come to
me willingly.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And the witch?&#34; She glanced down at the human with a withering glare and
was rewarded as Max dropped to his knees to beg forgiveness.</p>

<p>&#34;Stand up, Max.&#34; Hela said, &#34; the witch doesn't need to be broken for me to
use her power -- energy -- all I need is the slayer.&#34;  The poor little human
still looked totally confused; Hela sighed dramatically.  &#34;The connection
between the slayer and a witch cannot be broken, all I need to reach the
source of both their power is one or the other.&#34;</p>

<p>Comprehension finally dawned in Max's eyes.  Hela laughed again, &#34;let us go
and began phase two of the slayer's training.&#34;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Weeping softly, Buffy cradled the young girl's lifeless body. Some part of
her mind knew this was a dream.  That it was the same dream she'd been
having for weeks. Still, that knowledge didn't dull the pure agony she felt
when she looked down at the death clouded eyes of the innocent girl.</p>

<p>&#34;Why did you let me die?&#34; The girl's hollow soulless voice asked. &#34;Why
didn't you stop them?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I-I-I t-tried.&#34; Buffy stammered, still stunned by the accusation even after
all this time. &#34;It's not my fault. I couldn't...</p>

<p>The red haze that would normally gently fill Buffy's mind with the promise
of absolution instead slammed into her with a soul killing grief.</p>

<p>Her dream self fell to her knees gasping for air as the dead, innocent girl,
turned into Willow.  Only this time Willow changed into Jenny Calendar who
hung lifeless from Angelus' arms.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes you could have saved us all, Buffy.&#34; A familiar baritone said from
behind her.</p>

<p>She turned toward the voice and saw her first watcher, Merrik, the blood
still oozing from the gapping hole in his chest.</p>

<p>&#34;You could have saved her, Buffy,&#34; he repeated pointing at Jenny. &#34;Just like
you could have saved us all.  If only you had tried harder, just a little
more effort and none of us would have died.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy tried to cover up her ears so she couldn't hear the truth of the words
Merrick spoke.</p>

<p>He was joined by all the innocent victims she'd hadn't saved over the last
several years.</p>

<p>&#34;You could have saved us,&#34; the voices of the failed screamed at her. &#34;If you
had tried, you could have saved us, if you had really wanted to you could
have saved us all.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;NO, NO, NO, NO!&#34; Buffy shouted as loud as she could, trying to drown out
the crowd. &#34;I tried, I really tried, please believe me. PLEASE!&#34;</p>

<p>The voices stopped.</p>

<p>Buffy slowly opened eyes she hadn't known she had closed.  She peered around
and found that she was alone. The silence was every bit as damning as the
cries of the people she'd failed.</p>

<p>She stood, as the cold feeling of loneliness began to creep into her bones.</p>

<p>&#34;Then why do you resist your punishment?&#34; The musical voice of her last
dream asked. &#34;Accept your punishment, surrender to its power, and you will
never be lonely or in pain again.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy felt herself falling -- and as soon as she gave into the beautiful
siren song of the music a red light washed over her -- with a pain so
intense it became pleasure.  The promise of absolution from the other dreams
becoming the reality of ecstasy.</p>

<p>Buffy woke still crying out....</p>

<p>Realizing it was just another of those weird dreams that she forgot as soon
as she woke up, she choked off her screams. She didn't want to wake her
beloved lying next to her. She watched as the beautiful redhead stirred
slightly and mumbled something in her sleep.</p>

<p>The love Buffy felt for her soulmate rose up in her--she was sure that there
had never, in the history of the entire world, been anyone more beautiful
than her Wills.  She gently stroked her lover's side, knowing the contact
would at once reassure the witch of her love and help her Wills settle back
into deep sleep.</p>

<p>After the ambush Buffy really didn't expect Willow to wake-up before noon,
at the earliest, but the slayer had to make sure her soulmate wouldn't
disturb her.</p>

<p>Buffy noted the bright morning sunlight streaming into the room from the
open curtains.  She had been too exhausted the night before to close them,
so she got up out of bed to close them now.</p>

<p>As Buffy slid out of bed, she quietly made her way to the downstairs
bathroom, stopping by her dresser to pick up a special item.</p>

<p>She closed the bathroom door and leaned against it vaguely wondering what
she was doing.  Why was she in the bathroom downstairs, she questioned, when
all she wanted to do was close the curtains?</p>

<p>Music intruded into her conscious mind; maybe Giles was re-living his
mid-life crisis?  She thought, while making sure the door was locked.</p>

<p>Still confused at her own actions she tried to make out the words to the
music and couldn't, though she knew exactly what the music wanted her to do.</p>

<p>Slowly, the slayer climbed into the bathtub and sat down on the back edge.
After a few moments she realized she had something in her hand.</p>

<p>Buffy studied the beautiful knife she held in her left hand. She admired the
way the tapered black plastic handle fit her hand as if it were made for
her. The shining surgical steel blade reflected the harsh fluorescent light
into her eyes.</p>

<p>Caught in the thrall of the musical voice she laid the flat of the blade
against her cheek, enjoying the feel of the cool steel on her fevered skin.
Buffy slowly pulled the flat of the blade across her cheek to her mouth.</p>

<p>Pausing before she brushed the dangerous implement over her lips--her tongue
suddenly flicked out without her knowledge or control--over the needle sharp
point.  The slayer gasped and pulled back--her mind clearing for just an
instant -- until the coppery sweet taste of her own blood washed over her
taste buds.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and leaned her head back feeling her entire nervous
system tingle as it carried the pain from her tongue seemingly throughout
her body.  It began to focus in her belly where it ended up as a burning
knot.</p>

<p>The incredible dark music seemed to bury itself deep inside of Buffy.  The
girl could almost feel tentacles detaching from the knot in her belly and
spreading through out her body.</p>

<p>As each of the dark snakes surfaced it called for more pain--more blood.
Buffy couldn't help but answer the song--she had to be punished--she had to
suffer for her sins.</p>

<p>Buffy lowered the razor sharp blade until it rested against the soft highly
sensitive skin of her inner thigh.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;How perfect the same knife I used on Faith. &lt;&gt; She told herself,
&lt;&gt;someone else I've let down. &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy slowly drew the blade up her thigh, bearing down enough so it sliced
through her flesh. The pain was exquisite. The darkness expanding inside of
her applauded.</p>

<p>&#34;At last--I can feel something else,&#34; the slayer hissed and repeated the
process on her other thigh.</p>

<p>She was panting heavily as the nearly orgasmic pain took control of her mind
and body.</p>

<p>Buffy turned on the water and let it mix with her blood and carry it down
the drain. She ran her finger across her skin coating it with the blood
flowing freely from the cuts. She put the finger in her mouth, sucked, and
licked the blood from the digit.</p>

<p>Buffy was in her own world of pain, blood, and the dark song urging her on,
demanding more pain more blood.</p>

<p>Demanding she do it in payment for her numerous past failures.  It was
telling her that only her own suffering could possibly pay for causing all
the pain and death that ruled her life.</p>

<p>And Buffy was lost.</p>

</table>

<p>Willow woke up trembling from the disturbing dream. In it
 Buffy was
being chased by a mass of pure evil from which
 she couldn't escape. It
was terrible because not only was
 it was killing her beloved. It was
doing it in slow
 torturous stages.</p>

<p>Every time Willow had tried to help
 the dream Buffy, the magic attacked
her lover weakening her
 resistance further. Willow shook her head trying
to clear
 the terrifying vision from her mind. She reached for her
 lover
needing reassurance and panicked when she found her
 gone.</p>

<p>Choking down the sick bile that rose in her
 throat the witch noticed the
sun streaming into the bedroom
 window and relaxed.</p>

<p>"The sun must've woken her up and
 she went to the bathroom or for a run
or something." Willow
 reasoned with herself gaining control of her
rapidly
 beating heart.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the clock told her it
 was still very early. For the
second time in less than a
 month she wondered at her fast recovery from
using her
 magic to the point of exhaustion. For all intents and
 purposes
she should have been out of it until noon and
 still be wasted for
another day or two. There really should
 be no possible way that she was
awake and ready to go
 at-she rechecked the clock--the ungoddessly hour
of eight
 in the morning!</p>

<p>She sat up to wait for her wayward
 soulmate to return, listening
intently for her lover's soft
 steps. While stretching, she thought
contentedly about the
 kind of punishment for her fiances return. It was
almost an
 unwritten rule that neither was to leave the other alone
 the
morning after a battle like they had the night before.
 &nbsp;
Buffy was in definite need of a lesson in manners
 and Willow knew
exactly how she was going to teach her.</p>

<p>After thirty minutes, when Buffy hadn't returned,
 Willow decided it was
time to get up and fix breakfast. It
 was obvious that Buffy must have
gone for a run or over to
 Giles' for some training and wouldn't be back
until
 afternoon.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't blame her slayer for
 thinking she wouldn't be awake for
a while yet. But still,
 something just didn't 'feel' right about Buffy
leaving her
 this morning.
They always waited for each other to wake-up
 no matter how long it took.</p>

<p>She sighed. &lt;&gt; Might
 as well go get dressed and at least check over
 at
Giles'.&lt;&gt; She thought pulling on some sweats. She
 was on her way out of
the house when she noticed a light
 coming from under the downstairs
bathroom door.</p>

<p>Relieved and curious as to why Buffy would come all the
 way down here
Willow knocked; then she began to get worried
 when she got no response.
"Buffy, open the door. Are you
 hurt?" She called out.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I'll bet she's trying
 to hide those damn nightmares again.&lt;&gt; Willow
thought
 angrily. &lt;&gt;I don't know why she won't let me help her,
 she
always did in the past.&lt;&gt;
After pounding on
 the door few more time Willow really began to get
worried.
 &lt;&gt; Maybe she fell?&lt;&gt; The witch reasoned as she got
 the master
key from her desk in the 'office'.</p>

<p>The
 young redhead almost wished that her lover had fallen because
 what
she found was far more disturbing.</p>

<p>"Buffy,
 what the Hades are you doing?" Willow yelled, when she saw
 what
her roommate was doing. "You stop that right now!" She
 realized that she
was channelling her mother, but she
 honestly did not know what to say.</p>

<p>Willow could
 plainly see the horror reflected in her beloved eyes.
 Then
confusion as she looked down at her legs. When the
 tiny slayer moved
Willow got a view of the damage she
 wished she would never have seen:
the insides of both her
 lover's thighs were criss-crossed with deep
cuts.</p>

<p>Buffy looked back up to at her, opening her mouth as
 if to say
something, and then closing it with an audible
 snap. Her blood covered
hands were holding Faith's knife.</p>

<p>Buffy dropped the knife and began crying
 uncontrollably. Willow knew she
would never forget the
 sight, Buffy was sitting on the back edge of the
small
 bathtub. Her beloveds blood was every where and Buffy had
 just
finished the last of several cuts on her inner thighs.
 When she finally
got Buffys attention Willow knew she'd
 never forget the look in Buffys
eyes. Her pain and fear
 were evident, but there was another more subtle
emotion
 just under the surface and it frightened Willow as well.
 Buffy
was aroused. Reacting on her first instinct Willow
 ran to kneel at
Buffys side.</p>

<p>"Honey why?" Willow
 asked her voice soft and full of compassion. "How
could you
 do this to your self?"</p>

<p>"I let them die." Buffy said in
 a tiny little girl voice. "I have to
feel the pain they
 felt when they died."</p>

<p>"I don't understand sweetheart
 tell me what you are talking about."
Willow insisted
 quietly but firmly. "Who did you let die?"</p>

<p>When Buffy
 couldn't seem to give her an answer Willow went ahead and
 got
Buffy out of her blood soaked clothing. She examined
 the cuts Buffy had
inflicted on herself and while they had
 bled freely they weren't serious
and with Buffys Slayer
 healing powers they would probably be mere
memories by
 tomorrow, a memory
Willow knew she wouldn't soon forget.</p>

<p>Willow tried to pry an answer from Buffy about where
 she'd gotten the
idea to hurt herself like that but all the
 Slayer could do was weep and
shrug her shoulders. In order
 to keep Buffy from withdrawing further
from her, Willow
 decided to let the subject drop for the time being.
 She
also was persuaded by Buffy to not tell Giles or her
 mother about the
incident.</p>

<p>That was possibly one of
 the worst decisions she could have made.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Hela
 had gently probed the fringes of the two girls psyches looking
 for
an exploitable weakness, carefully peeling away the
 layers of their id
until she found exactly what she was
 searching for.</p>

<p>Deep in the Slayers subconscious was a
 deep seeded guilt over the deaths
of a few innocents that
 she'd not been able prevent.</p>

<p>For some reason that Hela
 couldn't understand, the Slayer felt
responsible for the
 incidental fatalities that occurred during her war
with
 darkness.</p>

<p>After some careful manipulations of the
 youngsters subconscious Hela was
able to control Buffys
 dreams. By doing this she was able to undermine
the Slayers
 abilities and by doing that it kept her little witch
 kit
preoccupied and unable to combat Hela effectively.</p>

<p>"Soon little one." Hela said to the nude blonde female
 chained to the
Countess' throne. The broken vampire nuzzled
 Helas leg and Hela stroked
her hair smiling at the new pets
 response. "It won't be long before I
get you some new
 playmates. You'd like that wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Unable to
 speak the vampire nodded her agreement.</p>

<p>"Oh you poor
 thing," Hela said with mock sympathy "Maybe I
 shouldn't
have pulled out your tongue, but you wouldn't
 shut up and I was hungry."</p>

<p>Hela let the scrying sphere
 dissipate then took the chain holding her
pet to her chair
 and using it as a leash the Countess led her toward
 her
private quarters, the female vampire was visibly
 trembling in fear.</p>

<p>She had every reason to fear.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Willow
 was at a loss, normally when Buffy was in the grip of one of
 her
nightmares, Willow would take care of it. If research
 and/or spells
didn't work than all she had to do is use
 their spiritual link to go
into the Slayers mind and find
 whatever personal demon was tormenting
Buffy.</p>

<p>Then
 the two of them would face it together and the nightmare would
 soon
be gone for a while, usually. Sure some of them would
 return but with
her Wills to protect her Buffy never
 worried about them for long.</p>

<p>This time was different,
 research didn't help. There were no spells to
study, and
 when Willow tried to enter Buffy's dream all she saw was
 a
vague vision of the Slayer fleeing some evil mass that
 was threatening
to engulf her. When Willow tried to delve
 further into these visions
Buffys mind would close to and
 force her out. When Willow attempted to
talk to her best
 friend about them, Buffy would go into a deep
depression
 and cry hysterically.</p>

<p>All these clues led Willow to
 believe that some unknown force was
attacking the Slayer
 through her dreams.</p>

<p>She'd tried to find an answer in
 the Book of Souls, but every time she
went near the tome
 any more she found herself drawn to one of the
sections
 that she and Giles had been unable to decipher. Willow
 had
thought they had beaten it when she'd broken the symbol
 code it was
originally written in, using what she'd found
 elsewhere in the book. But
even having the letters didn't
 help because the language couldn't be
translated. No matter
 where they looked, they were unable to find an
example of
 any language even remotely like it, ancient or modern.</p>

<p>Still every time she was anywhere near, she'd find
 herself starring at
that section, like she realized she was
 doing right now, tracing each
beautifully handwritten
 letter teaching herself to pronounce each
syllable
 phonetically memorising it over and over until it was
 etched
indelibly on her mind and soul. She was beginning to
 think she was
losing her mind. Then as if that wasn't bad
 enough these new powers and
skills began appearing with out
 warning.</p>

<p>Some of her new found talents she acquired
 from the Book of Souls, once
she'd learned how to do
 something it wasn't long before she could it
almost without
 thinking, then with a little practice each power
 became
quickly stronger. For example levitation, it wasn't
 just pencils
anymore. She advanced slowly at first by
 picking up a small book but
instead of taking months to
 improve, within a week she was able to pick
up Buffy,
 Giles, even Giles' car. It was almost frightening.</p>

<p>What
 bothered her even was the ones that just appeared, it was like
 a
voice in her head would tell her how and suddenly she
 could see the aura
of magic, but last night had been really
 scary. Willow didn't know what
caused her to wake up, but
 as soon as her eyes were open she knew she
was alone again.</p>

<p>Normally when she and Buffy were asleep they held each
 other or at the
very least they were touching but, since
 the girl had died and Buffys
nightmares had begun again, it
 wasn't unusual for Willow to wake up in
the middle of the
 night to find herself alone. The first time was the
night
 she'd found her best friend and lover in the downstairs
 bathroom
cutting herself with Faiths knife.</p>

<p>The
 memory of the sight of Buffy sitting on the edge of the tub
 cutting
herself, blood splattered everywhere, and the
 horrified look on her face
when she realized what she'd
 done sprung unbidden into Willows minds
eye.</p>

<p>With
 it she felt the panic rising in her but before she could jump
 out
of bed to search for her missing lover, that voice in
 her had stopped
her.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Be calm witch and you
 will find the one you seek.&lt;&gt; the voice told
her.</p>

<p>"But I've got to find her." Willow said to the empty
 room.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Relax, all will be well.&lt;&gt; Willow
 froze for a moment confused by the
sudden intrusion.
 &lt;&gt;I am not an intrusion.&lt;&gt; the voice informed her.
 &lt;&gt;I
am a part of you.&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>It was then
 that she realised the voice had spoken to her before
 and
every time she listened something good happened.</p>

<p>"Okay self," Willow said to an empty room "Tell me, how do
 I find my
Buffy."</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Relax.&lt;&gt; the voice
 instructed. &lt;&gt;Let your mind become blank.&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>Willow sat back on the bed, she closed her eyes and began
 to take deep
calming breaths.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Concentrate
 on your beloved.&lt;&gt; it continued. &lt;&gt;Feel how much
 you love
her, how much you need her.&lt;&gt;
Willow
 filled her mind with images of her blonde Slayer. She
 recalled
how the sunlight reflected off her hair and the
 way she'd smile at her
and the look in her lovers eyes
 whenever she approached.</p>

<p>Within minutes Willow could
 feel her senses and emotions begin to reach
out, it was as
 if her all consuming love and need for Buffy came to
 life
and within seconds had reached out to every room in
 the house.</p>

<p>In a flash of insight she knew Buffy was
 downstairs in the spare room
and she could feel that Buffy
 was hurt.
Willow jumped out of bed and after grabbing the
 first aid bag and was
hurrying to her friends side to help
 in any way she could. Willow found
Buffy kneeling on the
 floor of the spare bedroom, her body covered with
bleeding
 wets and scratches as if she'd been attacked by a cat.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Willow called softly her voice trembling with
 fear for her love
"Buffy honey, come on back to bed."</p>

<p>It was spooky, Buffy just knelt there saying nothing, in
 fact not making
a sound as Willow treated her wounds. Tears
 flowed from her eyes but she
made no sound, not a gasp, not
 a sob, nothing.</p>

<p>Willow finished tending to the
 superficial wounds, then she sat cross-
legged on the floor
 facing her entranced friend. Closing her eyes the
young
 witch began reaching out with her mind to her lover. Once
 again
all she got were vague images. She felt her stomach
 turn as she came
into contact with the reddish-yellow fog
 that surrounded Buffy's dream.
The evil of that force
 sickened Willow.</p>

<p>Swallowing her revulsion Willow
 pushed her way through the fog. She
could taste and smell
 the hatred and insanity that permeated the force.
Just as
 she was about break and see the nature and source of the
 power
plaguing her friend, there was a sudden surge of
 power that expelled
Willow from Buffys mind. Before the
 witch could counter attack the evil
was gone.</p>

<p>Buffys dull glazed over eyes came back into focus then
 closed as she
fell into heap on the floor. Although she was
 sleeping naturally, Buffy
was still crying uncontrollably.
 Willow moved to her loves side and
taking the sobbing girl
 into her arms Willow began gently rocking her
whispering
 and humming softly trying to comfort and reassure
 Buffy,
telling her that everything was going to be alright.</p>

<p>She knew she was lying.</p>

<p>With that 'failure'
 weighing heavily on her mind Willow once again
returned to
 research. She searched, read, and discarded the rest of
 that
day until her head was pounding and it was impossible
 for her to keep
her eyes open. Willow pushed herself away
 from the desk, she yawned and
stretched her aching muscles
 stiffened by long hours at the computer.</p>

<p>Too exhausted
 to go home, Willow staggered across the room and
collapsed
 on to Giles' couch next to Buffys already sleeping form.</p>

<p>That night after an another uneventful patrol (four
 vamps down, goddess
knows how many more to go) the two
 girls spent nearly two hours trying
to get from the jacuzzi
 to their bed, then they both fell into a deep
exhausted
 sleep.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;WAKE UP!&lt;&gt; Willow woke up with
 that voice again this time screaming
for her to rise.
 &lt;&gt;Wake up or your beloved is lost.&lt;&gt;
That
 cleared the sleep induced fog right out of her brain. She
 first
noticed the clock, it was four A.M. and Buffy was
 gone. Using her new
found power Willow searched the house,
 but found her Buffy was nowhere
to be found. Slipping into
 her robe and slippers, Willow ran out of
their room and
 downstairs. As she searched, Willow felt a warm
 breeze
coming from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Oh goddess please
 no!" Willow moaned as she went to investigate.</p>

<p>Entering the kitchen Willows worst fears were
 realized, the back door
was standing wide open. Willow ran
 outside in a panicked frenzy, her
mind full of images of
 what could happen to her friend, out there
unaware of her
 surroundings, dressed in only a tank top and boxers,</p>

<p>"She didn't even put on her shoes." Willow said to
 herself.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't figure out which direction to
 begin looking. Finally as
a last resort she closed her eyes
 and tried to concentrate.</p>

<p>"Okay, Willow Rosenberg."
 she said under her breath. "Lets see just how
good you
 are."
Willow began to take slow deep breaths and cleared
 her mind of
everything except her overwhelming need for her
 soulmate. As the feeling
rose to the surface it almost
 became a living thing with the single
minded urge to find
 the Slayer, and reunite her with her one true love.</p>

<p>When it reached its peak Willow released it and within
 seconds it was
leading Willow at a dead run in the
 direction of the Slayer. She came
upon Buffy four blocks
 from home. She was walking barefoot down the
street,
 leaving bloody foot prints with every step.</p>

<p>Willow got
 around in front of her to try to stop her but Buffy just
 kept
walking in some kind of trance unknowing, unfeeling,
 her normally lively
flashing blue eyes dull and lifeless,
 reflecting no emotion.
Willow tried yelling at her,
 shaking her, even slapping her. But Buffy
just kept on
 walking. Going against her reluctance to use magic on
 her
helpless lover, Willow found she had no choice.</p>

<p>"STOP!" Willow commanded. Then looking deep into
 Buffy's dull eyes she
softly said, "Return to me my life,
 my love, my reason for being."</p>

<p>Buffys eyelids
 fluttered, her eyes focused. "What the..where
am...Wills?"
 Buffy stammered as she became aware of her surroundings
 "Oh
gods, not again."
With moan of complete despair
 Buffy's eyes rolled up, and she collapsed,
her mind
 shutting from the sensory overload.</p>

<p>Willow knelt down
 next to Buffy and examined her for any injuries
besides her
 feet. Finding nothing else, Willow reached down and
 gently
lovingly caressed her soulmates cheek then gently
 brushed a wayward
strand of hair from Buffys forehead.</p>

<p>"Sleep my love." Willow said softly the love she felt
 for Buffy shining
in her dark green eyes. "Your Wills is
 here, she'll take care of you."</p>

<p>Willow stood up and
 brushed herself off then looked lovingly down at
 her
sleeping lover. She quietly chanted a levitation spell,
 a soft green
glow formed around Buffy and she slowly rose
 from the ground till she
was level with Willows waist.
 Then, with a prayer of thanks to the
Goddess and hoping
 nobody would see them, Willow took her unconscious
lover
 home.</p>

<p>Once there Willow laid Buffy carefully on their
 oversized couch and
gently but thoroughly cleaned Buffys
 badly cut feet.
"My poor baby." Willow whispered
 sympathetically. "Look what's been done
to your poor feet."</p>

<p>Tears fell unnoticed from the young witches eyes as
 she removed the
shards of glass and other debris that were
 lodged in Buffys feet.</p>

<p>Once finished with that she
 carefully bandaged the Slayers feet, knowing
that they'd be
 healed by afternoon. Then she examined the rest of her
love
 to make sure there were no other physical injuries.</p>

<p>Satisfied that she'd done all she could for now and not
 wanting to wake
Buffy up, Willow carefully laid down beside
 the sleeping girl then
wrapped her arms around her troubled
 soulmate, pulled her close and very
gently reached out with
 her mind and lightly touched Buffy's sleeping
mind.</p>

<p>Finding her love to be sleeping naturally Willow
 mentally soothed Buffys
restless subconscious while she
 physically snuggled as close as she
could.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow Giles *will* give us the night off." Willow
 whispered in
Buffys ear knowing that her lover could hear
 on one level or another
"Maybe, if we can get away from all
 this for a day, we'll be able to get
a handle on all this
 and put a stop to it."</p>

<p>As Willow drifted off to sleep,
 both girls were smiling slightly as the
eerie green glow
 surrounded them, keeping them safe.</p>

</table>

<p>Giles was already deep into his research of the Book of Souls, still
trying to find some kind of clue that might help him to come up with a
translation for that elusive section that as yet had defied his attempts
at translating its mysteries into something he or Willow could
understand.
A smile cross his face when he thought of the young highly talented
witch. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;At least Willow was able to break the symbol codes.&lt;&gt; he admonished
himself. &lt;&gt;That's a hell of a lot more than you could old boy. If it
wasn't for her you'd still be wallowing around in some dusty library
lost. I just wish I could figure out how to translate ancient High
Gaelic.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Giles felt this way every time he thought about the petite red head and
her incredible talents, both in research and in the mystic arts and her
recent advances. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Pretty soon neither of them will need you at all.&lt;&gt; Giles speculated.
&lt;&gt;Then what will you do with yourself? Really Rupert, you are such an
idiot at times. Neither of them will ever let you leave. So what the
hell are you worried about?&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his two wayward charges
calling his name. </p>

<p>"Hey Giles, where are you?" Buffy called out as both girls collapsed
onto his couch. "Come on out here. We gotta talk." </p>

<p>"What is it Buffy?" he asked entering the room from his study. He looked
at the two obviously exhausted girls. "Good lord you two look positively
awful. Was last nights patrol that bad?" </p>

<p>"Gee thanks. I hope your better at talkin' to mom than you are to us."
Buffy scolded him. "You never tell a woman she looks awful, even if she
does." </p>

<p>"Ah..yes..well..ah Sorry about that." Giles stammered, more than a
little embarrassed at his tactless remark and the mention of Joyce
Summers,even by her daughter. "I suppose I could have phrased that
better, but that still doesn't answer my question. Was last nights
patrol that bad?" </p>

<p>"That's just the point Giles." Willow spoke out before Buffy could start
to babble again. "We haven't had any significant contact since we were
ambushed last week and well, Giles, quite frankly the pressure is
starting to get to both of us." </p>

<p>For the first time Giles took a really close look at both girls. Both of
them were looking pale and drawn, and Buffy was beginning to develop
dark circles under her eyes. He also noticed that both girls were
getting a little jittery. </p>

<p>"Come on Giles, we're not askin' for that much." Buffy said putting on
her best little girl pouty face (she knew he could never say no to that
face.) "All we want is one night off before the wedding and that's only
a few days away." </p>

<p>"Just one night to go out and act like two normal people in love."
Willow added. "All we want is a date, you know, dinner, maybe a movie,
maybe a little dancing. A little quiet, quality time to spend with my
bestest girl." </p>

<p>"Yeah, pleeeeese?" they said in unison putting their heads together,
making even the normally reserved Englishman chuckle at their antics. </p>

<p>Giles removed his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He knew he
had lost already and so did the girls. He was just stalling long enough
to salvage some small shred of his dignity before he surrendered.
Finally he replaced his glasses and let out a deep sigh of resignation. </p>

<p>"All right ladies, I suppose you have more than earned some time to
yourselves." Giles said, officially surrendering. "If you promise to
spend the remainder of the day resting, then I see no reason you can not
have a girls night out so to speak." </p>

<p>"We promise." Buffy said putting her hand over her heart. </p>

<p>"Swear it, honest." Willow joined in. </p>

<p>The girls jumped and hugged the stoic Englishman, who sputtered and
cleared his throat, blushing bright red embarrassed by their open
display of affection. Both girls left soon after the hugs, chatting
endlessly about their plans for their night out. </p>

<p>Giles smiled, slightly pleased with himself feeling he'd made the right
decision. He heard the door slam shut and returned to his research. </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow were making the best of their night off. Deciding to go
casual, Buffy wore a silk blouse tucked into her best designer jeans and
a pair of shiny black 'cowboy' boots. Willow wore white pants with a
black vest over a blue denim shirt and a pair of comfortable mules. As
planed they stepped out their front door around 7:30 pm and linking arms
the two lovers strolled down the sidewalk for their much anticipated
date. </p>

<p>Their first destination was their favorite restaurant for a leisurely
candle light dinner. From there they went to see a movie that Willow had
wanted to see, but they spent so much time kissing and groping each
other in the dark theater that they missed most of the movie. So Buffy
promised to rent it when it came out on video. </p>

<p>They left the movie and walked the streets of downtown Sunnydale hand in
hand enjoying the night air and the pleasant company. </p>

<p>"I wish we could be like this forever." Willow said with a wistful sigh. </p>

<p>"Yeah." Buffy agreed. "No vamps, no demons, no Slayer, no destiny, just
you and me together. Yeah, I'd really like that." </p>

<p>Willow let go of Buffy's hand and slipped her arm around the blonde
girls waist and lay her head on the Slayers shoulder. </p>

<p>"This is nice." Willow whispered happily. </p>

<p>"Uh huh." Buffy answered kissing her lovers head. </p>

<p>"Do we have to go home yet?" Willow inquired. "I really don't want
tonight to end yet." </p>

<p>"Me either." Buffy said stopping. "But where should we go?" </p>

<p>"Some place fun." Willow said stepping back and seeing the mischievous
smile on her lovers beautiful lips. </p>

<p>"Some place with decent music." Buffy said to give her little witch
another hint as to what she had in mind. "Where we can dance." </p>

<p>"Somewhere some of our friends might be." Willow laughed her eyes
lighting up at the prospect of returning to their old haunt. </p>

<p>"The Bronze!" They both said at the same time. </p>

<p>Buffy took Willows hand and began pulling her anxiously toward their
destination. They were both eager to see their favorite old hang out.
Neither one of them had been there since they'd become a couple. In
fact, this would be the first they'd been anywhere that they had hung
out at before their coming out. </p>

<p>"Hurry up pokey." Buffy called out playfully as she tugged at Willows
sleeve. </p>

<p>Willow laughed and allowed her soulmate to drag her through the streets
of Sunnydale until they came to the old warehouse that had been
converted into the most popular dance club in the area. As they
approached they could feel the vibrations of the heavy bass emanating
from the club. </p>

<p>"Come on Buffy slow down please." Willow pleaded breathlessly. "Let me
catch my breath. What's the big hurry?" </p>

<p>Buffy stopped and pulled the red head to her, pressing her body tightly
against her lovers. Buffy gazed longingly into the dark green eyes of
her universe. </p>

<p>"I can't wait to get you on that dance floor." Buffy growled and ground
her pelvis into Willows. "Those kids haven't seen hot 'til I get you out
there." </p>

<p>Willow looked into Buffy's heavy lidded lust filled eyes and gulped. Her
heart was pounding hard against her chest. </p>

<p>"We could go home now." Willow whispered huskily. </p>

<p>"Oh no you don't." Buffy stated firmly. "Dance first, home later." </p>

<p>She turned and pulled Willow to the front door of the Bronze. The door
man recognised them and let them in immediately. </p>

<p>As they entered the crowded club, Buffy surveyed the room, and spotted
Xander sitting with Cordelia holding hands across a table and gazing
into each others eyes. With Willow in tow Buffy pushed her way through
the crowd to their friends table. </p>

<p>"Hey guys!" Buffy yelled to be heard above the music and smiling when
the couple jumped in surprise. "What cha doin'?" </p>

<p>She had on her innocent 'who me' face as they sat down at the couples
table. When the waitress arrived Buffy and Willow ordered cokes then
Buffy grabbed Willows hand. </p>

<p>"Lets dance, babe." Buffy shouted and pulled Willow onto the dance
floor. </p>

<p>She pulled her red haired lover close, the two girls looked into each
others eyes, and began moving to the heavy throbbing beat of the music.
It was as if everyone else ceased to exist and the stars and planets
revolved around only them. </p>

<p>The lovers only stopped dancing long enough to get a drink of their
sodas then got right back on the dance floor. Willow hadn't danced this
much in her entire life, nor had she ever wanted to until there was
Buffy. </p>

<p>Finally after a particularly long slow dance the two lovers came out of
their trance enough to notice they were the center of attention, even
the employees were watching them. </p>

<p>It was then they realized how heavy and rapid their breathing had
become. They made their way back to the table where Xander was starring
at them slack jawed and Cordelia suggested they 'get a room'. </p>

<p>"Lets go home." Willow whispered huskily into Buffy's ear, then bit it
lightly to get her point across. </p>

<p>Buffy nodded. The girls finished off their drinks, said their good-byes,
and headed for the nearest exit. Laughing and enjoying the cool night
air after the steamy stuffy atmosphere of the club they held hands and
headed out in the direction of their home. </p>

<p>The route home took them by a poorly lit heavily wooded park that
adjoined the oldest of the towns many cemeteries. As they passed the
park, both girls stopped dead in their tracks when they both heard two
distinct terrified screams. They turned and looked at each other their
disappointment showing clearly in their eyes. </p>

<p>"No rest for the Chosen One, I guess." Buffy said sadly and shrugged. </p>

<p>"Or for her faithful soulmate." Willow added trying to lighten the mood.
Then putting on her resolve face she said. "I'm ready when you are." </p>

<p>"Couldn't do it without you." Buffy said caressing her friends cheek,
only to be interrupted by another scream. </p>

<p>"Let's go." Buffy turned and kicked a slat out of a near by park bench
and picked up the make shift stake, then took off running across the
park toward the screams. </p>

<p>As she ran after the much faster Slayer, Willow began chanting
protection spells. They crossed the park and entered the old cemetery,
running past the old tombstones and came around an old mausoleum where
Buffy came to a sliding halt. </p>

<p>Willow almost ran into the Slayer and was about to complain when she saw
the look on Buffy's face, following Buffy's gaze Willow saw why her
companion had stopped short. </p>

<p>On a small rise behind the old mausoleum tied to tall headstones was a
young couple that looked barely old enough to date. </p>

<p>Two rather nasty looking demons were tormenting their helpless victims.
They had already ripped all the couples clothes off, and judging by the
cuts and bruises covering their bodies, the demons had been torturing
the young boy and girl for quite a while before the Slayer had arrived. </p>

<p>Both of the innocent victims were fighting for air and looked pleadingly
at the Slayer, as if begging her to save them. </p>

<p>"Hello Slayer." a deep voice said from the shadows. "I almost lost
control of those two while we waited for you. I wanted you to see how
they die." </p>

<p>A tall gaunt vampire stepped from the shadows. As they watched, his face
took on the twisted demented visage of the demon within him. He raised
his arm then clenched his hand into a fist. At that signal, the vampires
restraining the demons let them go. </p>

<p>The two blood crazed demons attacked their defenseless victims, ripping
their living bodies into small shreds. The couples screams of terror and
agony filled the night air, slicing into Buffy's ears, etching their
final tortures onto her soul. </p>

<p>While Buffy and Willow watched in helpless horror, as the demons
murdered the couple, several more vampires stepped out of the shadows to
join their leader. Before the girls realized it they were surrounded by
their enemies. </p>

<p>"Buffy, they're gone." Willow whispered and looked around nervously at
the distinctly unfriendly circle of vampires. "And I think we're in
trouble." </p>

<p>"I'd say you might be right Wills." Buffy said, losing the look of
horror and replacing it with the cold calculating rage of the Slayer.
"Come on you useless blood suckers, it's time for you to die." </p>

<p>With an impatient growl, Buffy attacked the nearest vampire, dusting him
almost before any of his companions even realized the fight was on. </p>

<p>The rest became a blur of kicks and punches with the occasional sound of
a stake piercing undead flesh. Willow was casting protective shields
around herself and Buffy. </p>

<p>Several of the vampires were thrown back into the tombstones smashing
several bones. Often there were more injuries than the vampires
supernatural healing could fix before sunrise, causing them to retreat
back to their lairs. </p>

<p>Some were hit with one of Willows binding spells and found themselves
held in one spot so the Slayer could dust them without any trouble. </p>

<p>At this point in the fight, Willow was attacked by powerful dark bolts
of mystical energy. Some of it she was able to dissipate, but most of it
she deflected towards the attacking vampires. Every time one of the
bolts hit a vampire it disappeared in a puff of smoke. </p>

<p>The battle wore on and Buffy was nearing the limit of her reserves. She
could feel herself slowing down. She stumbled slightly and found herself
being slowly being beaten back by the seemingly endless onslaught of
vampires. </p>

<p>Buffy was beginning to fear that she and Willow would be dead very soon.
She knew none of the vamps had the guts to turn the Slayer or her witch
lover. </p>

<p>Suddenly Buffy felt strength flowing back into her, energizing her body
and renewing her will to fight. She looked back over her shoulder and
Willow gave her a weak smile. Buffy knew Willow was using their
spiritual bond to give a portion of her energy to the Slayer. </p>

<p>Buffy stepped up her attack, knowing that Willow had drained most of her
reserves to support her. The Slayer knew it wouldn't be long before
Willow would be unable to function at any but the most basic levels. </p>

<p>Finally only four vampires remained and the Eastern horizon was
beginning to lighten with the promise of the coming dawn. Buffy's heart
was pounding like a jackhammer, and her breath was coming in ragged
gasps. </p>

<p>She knew her clothes were ruined from the blood, sweat and rips
resulting from the fight. She had several deep cuts that were still
bleeding freely. </p>

<p>The determined blonde fell back a step hoping to lure one of her
opponents out. Buffy caught a movement out of the corner of her eye.
Spinning to face it, she saw Willow collapse to the ground. </p>

<p>"WILLS!" Buffy cried out fearing the worst.
She took up a stance over her mate determined to defend her love to the
death, if necessary. </p>

<p>Seeing one of their opponents go down and the other fall back to a
defensive position, the vampires took the opportunity to attack. Finding
some reserve strength
Buffy hadn't realized she possessed, the slayer attacked and within
seconds had reduced her opponents by two swirling dust clouds. </p>

<p>In a final desperate effort Buffy tried to stand and face her remaining
attackers but having depleted her strength beyond its limits, the
exhausted Slayer fell to one knee. Try as she might the tiny blonde
could only brace herself to sell her life and that of her lover dearly
before falling to the seeming inevitable. </p>

<p>Seeing the apparent weakness of their seemingly indomitable opponent,
the final two vampires sensed a possibility of the defeat of the
legendary Slayer. With a roar of certain victory, the two undead
warriors launched their attack on their obviously defenseless victims. </p>

<p>Then, just as the two beasts were launching their attack, the clearing
lit up with an amazingly intense white light that seemed to appear out
of no where. </p>

<p>Both vampires disappeared in flames as Buffy watched in complete
amazement. Sensing the benevolence of the power Buffy allowed herself to
collapse next to her slowly recovering partner. She wondered where the
last minute reprieve came from, then a smirk came to her face as her
mind filled with a familiar voice. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;You have fought well Slayer.&lt;&gt; the voice of Lugh commended her. &lt;&gt;I
hope my assistance is not an insult, but I thought you could use the
rest.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>"No insult at all my friend." the tired girl said under her breath. "I
take it Morrigan and Brigit are there too." </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Of course they are my child.&lt;&gt; Lugh assured her. &lt;&gt;Their thoughts are
never far from you, as are mine. We sensed your distress and, as it
isn't your time to cross, I came to your aid. Normally this is not
allowed, but this time the others let me.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Buffy started to question Lugh on his comment but he stopped her. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;You are in no further danger my child.&lt;&gt; the Druids deep soothing
voice reassured the exhausted girl. &lt;&gt;Care for your beloved Sorceress.
She has defended you beyond any of our expectations. Only Brigit and
Morrigan foresaw her courage and love for you. They are justly proud of
you both and send their love.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>"Tell them that we return their feelings." Buffy answered and took a
deep cleansing breath. "Will we see you again Lugh, we miss you all a
lot." </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Of course my child.&lt;&gt; the voice of Lugh told her. &lt;&gt;We are bound
together as if by blood, we are never far. Now be off with you. When you
return to your sanctuary report all to your watcher, he will help you
face your coming trials.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Not sensing any other threat, and knowing that Lugh was never wrong,
Buffy knelt down and pulled Willows limp body into her arms. </p>

<p>"Wills baby talk to me." Buffy said quietly, panic and concern making
her voice quiver. "Come on sweetheart. I can feel your heart beating. I
know you're in there. Please Wills don't leave me like this. I need you.
Wills, please speak to me. I love you, Wills." </p>

<p>Buffy was crying in fear that somehow her lover had been injured
seriously. </p>

<p>"I love you too." Willow whispered weakly. "I'm okay, baby. Don't cry. I
just need to shut down for a while and recharge right now so I can't
move on my own right now so I guess I stay here and you get to watch.
Aren't you the lucky one." </p>

<p>"No probs Wills, I am the lucky one, I have you." Buffy said softly,
caressing the red heads cheek, her relief renewing her strength. "Better
yet, why don't I carry you home?" </p>

<p>Gathering the semi-conscious red head in her arms, Buffy turned towards
home. Tired and injured, she slowly made her way to the one place she
felt completely safe, and was soon approaching the front door of Giles'
townhouse. </p>

</table>

<p>Kresis was enraged, so enraged in fact he'd lost control, something he
rarely did. As soon as Helas emissary had arrived at his door he knew
he'd been played for a fool by his ex once again. </p>

<p>Once the black skinned demon had suffered enough, he finally confessed
to his part in her conspiracy. The Count had become nearly insane with
rage. Kresis was so enraged he'd torn the already terrified demon into
small pieces, all of which were scattered all around the throne room. </p>

<p>Several of his servants were attempting to clean up the torn bits of
flesh and the thick green goo that had passed for the demons blood from
the floors, walls, and furniture. </p>

<p>"I see my lords temperament hasn't improved since we were last
together." said a confident voice from across the room. </p>

<p>Kresis looked up and saw a tall muscular figure leaning against the door
frame casually. He knew only one being in this realm that dared address
him in such an insolent manner. </p>

<p>"Caladin, is that truly you my old friend." the Count shouted, what
passed for a smile spread across his face. "Thank the Darkness you are
here." </p>

<p>The only one there that didn't cringe when the Count flashed his razor
sharp teeth with fangs was the tall heavily muscled warrior. The
mercenary leader pushed himself off the door jam, and approached his
sworn liege lord and long time comrade. Caladin strode straight up to
the Count and took the offered hand. Kresis threw his other arm around
the big mans shoulders and took the in a fierce yet friendly embrace. </p>

<p>Caladin stepped back surprised that his old comrade and commander would
show such familiarity in a public place. He studied his face for a few
moments and saw the weariness and frustration clearly written on the
normally emotionless face. </p>

<p>"You seem to be troubled my lord." Caladin said quietly so that only
Kresis could hear him. "Is there anything I can do? My men and I are at
your service as always." </p>

<p>"As always my old friend, you have read the situation perfectly." Kresis
said, placing a taloned hand on the battle scared warriors shoulder. "It
is time I took control of this entire fiasco and now that you are here I
may even get out of this alive. Let us adjourn to a more private place,
we have some serious strategy to discuss." </p>

<p>The Count led his battle scarred friend from the room down a narrow
hallway to a small room that had a heavy wooden table and six chairs. On
the wall was a large highly detailed map of Sunnydale and the
surrounding area that contained far more detail than any normal map. The
detail, and the fact that the map was printed on cured human skin, led
Caladin to think that no ordinary human map maker was involved in its
creation. </p>

<p>Caladin went to a small bar in a corner of the room and found the
ingredients for the Counts favorite drink and a large bottle of his
favorite Irish whiskey (Bushmills). As Caladin made each of them a
drink, Kresis briefed his best strategist and warlord on the entire
situation leaving nothing out, including how he'd been fooled into
coming here by his ex, an adversary Caladin knew well. </p>

<p>"Well Caladin what do you think?" Kresis asked as he accepted the drink
the battle wise veteran brought him. "After all, besides me, you are the
only one I know of that has gone up against Hela and lived." </p>

<p>"Not by much, as you will recall." Caladin said tapping the empty socket
where his left eye had once been. "And that was a minor skirmish. The
bitch means to destroy you this time my lord." </p>

<p>"Yes well, be that as it may." Kresis said, doing his best to smile and
shrug. "If I don't receive word from Tarsus by tomorrow then I'll be
forced to join her in tomorrow nights ambush and going by our past
record, I will not fare well." </p>

<p>"Then it would be safe to assume that you have a contingency plan." the
cunning old warrior said smiling slyly. "And that plan will make use of
my men and I." </p>

<p>"Exactly my mercenary friend." Kresis said returning the smile "Only I
know of the existence of you and your mercenaries and I have cooked up a
little surprise for our dear sweet Hela. If it works out I'll have
vindicated myself with the darklord and the council, and our little lady
friend will pay the price for betraying me." </p>

<p>Caladin closed the door. It didn't open again for over six hours. Then
the two comrades shook hands and went their separate ways smiling at the
thought of getting revenge on their mutual long time enemy.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Same day early morning.</p>

<p>Giles was in his kitchen making his breakfast when he heard his front
door slam open. Grabbing a revolver with specially made ammunition from
a drawer, he cautiously entered the hallway and with the handgun at the
low ready position he approached the front entry-way. </p>

<p>"Stay where you are!" he ordered as he leapt into the small entrance
hall and found himself pointing the gun at Buffys face. </p>

<p>Buffy was standing there holding Willow in her arms. She looked
exhausted and, while Willow was unconscious, Giles couldn't see any
obvious injuries. </p>

<p>"Damn Giles, who are you tryin' to be?" Buffy exclaimed surprised to be
facing her watcher with a gun. "Englands answer to Dirty Harry!?" </p>

<p>Giles lowered the gun and stood speechless starring at the girls. </p>

<p>"Come on Giles, either shoot me or get out of the way." Buffy growled.
"Even a Slayer gets tired and my little sweetheart here is getting
heavy." </p>

<p>Once he stepped aside Buffy carried her precious burden into the living
room and laid her gently down on the oversized couch. She sat down next
to Willow and scooted over so that her red haired loves head rested on
her lap. </p>

<p>"What happened?" Giles asked worried about the two girls welfare. "Is
Willow alright?" </p>

<p>"She's just exhausted." Buffy explained wearily. "We ran into another
ambush, I don't know how many. I kept killing and killing and they just
kept coming. Willow was doing her best, but she keeps coming up against
some kind of higher dark magic that takes nearly everything she's got
just to hold it off. Between that and supporting me through our bond
she's drained almost completely. She collapsed just at sunrise."
Buffy broke down becoming almost hysterical. </p>

<p>"I thought...I wasn't...Oh Giles I was afraid she was hurt again." the
Slayer sobbed, heart broken by her inability to protect her red haired
lover. "I thought I'd failed her again but she woke enough to tell me
she's just tired and had to shut down to recharge then she passed out so
I carried her here. Giles you have to help us, this is just too much, I
can't do it any more." </p>

<p>The compassionate man sat on the coffee table facing Buffy and took her
hand then looked directly into the young Slayers blue-green eyes. His
first instinct was to scold the distraught young woman for not keeping
him informed but was stopped by the haunted look in those too old eyes. </p>

<p>"Fill me in Buffy." he began softly. "This is what the fourth or fifth
ambush in the last six weeks and I would say that was unusually high at
any time but even more so considering this is summer and activities
normally decrease during this season not increase. Further I have come
to the conclusion that this has something to do with your upcoming
nuptials. For some reason the dark side seems determined to stop them,
which would appear to be all the encouragement we need to see that they
go off without a hitch." </p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Giles ability to belabor the obvious, and his left
handed way of saying he approved of her and Willows making public their
commitment to each other. </p>

<p>"Okay, give me a minute will ya." She began resigning herself to
spending the next few hours bringing Giles up to date on what was going
on. </p>

<p>Buffy felt a twinge of guilt for not keeping Giles better informed, then
showing up on his doorstep expecting instant results.
It wasn't fair to Giles, especially when she knew he would now spend his
every waking moment trying to find a suitable solution for their
problems. </p>

<p>Knowing what Giles needed to know Buffy began back at the very first
ambush in June right after Litha. She described each ambush in as much
detail as she could recall, how each ambush was worse than the last, and
was harder to fend off. </p>

<p>She told him how Willow was being forced not only to face various demons
and vampires but she also had to fight an unknown assailant that used
very powerful dark magic was coordinating his attacks with that of the
others and judging by the strength of his magic this unknown force was
more than likely the leader. </p>

<p>Buffy also told him of the latest twist in demon strategy, how they
would use human hostages to lure them into the trap then while they
watched unable to help the demons would butcher the innocent victims.
How it had started with the teenage girl that had been taken from the
Bronze, and that it happened again last night to some poor couple whose
only mistake was picking the wrong tree to make out under. Including how
the slime demons had ripped their living bodies to shreds right in front
of the two girls. </p>

<p>Buffy laid her head back and closed her eyes, she could still hear the
young couples screams ringing in her ears, tearing at her soul. </p>

<p>"Please Giles you've gotta help us." Buffy pleaded her voice cracking as
she wept quietly. "We're in way over our heads here. Willow's been
wonderful, but look at her Giles, this is killing her." </p>

<p>Buffy gave her friend and mentor an anguished look. Even through the
pain and fear Giles could easily see her determination. </p>

<p>"She wasn't meant for this." the Slayer croaked her voice tight with
unreleased emotions. "I will not allow her to be hurt any more because
of this destiny thing." </p>

<p>"I'll die before I permit anything happen to her again." The petite
blonde straightened up her back stiffening with her resolve. "It's gotta
stop Giles. People, innocent people are dying." </p>

<p>Giles leaned forward and placed his hand on the Slayers shoulder giving
it a light reassuring squeeze. He looked deep into her red rimmed eyes.
The stress and horror of the last several weeks were clearly written in
her pain filled windows to the young girls soul. </p>

<p>Giles felt the tightness in his chest, wishing he could take her burdens
on for her, but he knew the only way he could help Buffy was to help her
cope with the dark realities of her life and support both her and Willow
in any way he could. </p>

<p>Giles was determined to perform that task to the best of his abilities. </p>

<p>"Okay Buffy." the ex-watcher said in that soft reassuring tone he
reserved just for his Slayer and her witch. "You and Willow stay here
and relax." </p>

<p>Giles rose from his seat and began pacing, causing Buffy to smile
slightly recognizing the familiar sign of the watcher's mind focusing on
a problem. </p>

<p>When he got this way she knew he wouldn't rest until he found a
satisfactory solution to their problems. </p>

<p>"If you get hungry, call for some delivery." Giles added
absent-mindedly. "The numbers are by the telephone, just have them
charge it to my account. If you want a shower go ahead. You already know
where everything is, probably better than I do. I'm sure the two of you
have at least one change around here somewhere. I want you to stay here,
so if I come up with something I will be able to find you." </p>

<p>"Alright, I didn't want to wake Wills up anyway." Buffy knew he just
wanted them to stay so he could watch over them. "I think we'll stay
right here on the couch for now. Wills looks comfortable, and I'm not
leavin' her right now for any reason." </p>

<p>"That's fine Buffy." he said. Then giving her an inquiring look asked
"Is there anything else I should know before I get started?" </p>

<p>"Ah...no nothing I can think of right now." Buffy said not wanting to
tell him about the dreams, the sleep walking, and the self-mutilation. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;He has enough to worry about.&lt;&gt; she told herself rationalizing her not
being completely honest with Giles. </p>

<p>"Okay then I will get to work." Giles said frowning, he had known Buffy
long enough to know when she was holding back something. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;She will tell me when she is ready.&lt;&gt; he reassured himself. </p>

<p>Giles headed for his study, leaving the girls to rest on the couch. He
would need all his resources to find the cause of these latest attacks
on the slayer and her chosen mate. His only hope was that whatever the
Slayer wasn't telling him was not something that could prove fatal
before she felt safe enough to share it with him.</p>

</table>

<p>Countess Hela sat in the throne room of her temporary home humming a
happy demented little tune. Her spies had brought her a report of the
ambush that fool Kresis' people had attempted, it failed as usual. All
her carefully laid plans were progressing nicely. </p>

<p>She'd very nearly had the Slayer that last time, but the little
witch-kit had interfered, but it wouldn't be long now. With Willow
draining her powers to the point of collapse she wouldn't be able to
interfere next time. </p>

<p>"I think I'll take a peek at my two little targets." the demoness hissed
happily. "Maybe I'll be able to drive the wedge between them even
further now that she's weakened." </p>

<p>Helas only worry was the source of the unknown power that had rescued
the two from last nights ambush. She cursed herself for not being there
to watch over her future pets. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;It simply wouldn't do to have Kresis take them after all I've invested
in their capture.&lt;&gt; she scolded herself. &lt;&gt;No that wouldn't do at all.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>With this thought in mind the powerful demoness began to carefully
recite the spell that created the scrying sphere. As the glowing red
ball appeared, Hela decided to enter the Slayers id to wreak even
further havoc with the young sensitive girls sanity. </p>

<p>As the vision of the two sleeping lovers came into focus. She cackled as
she fed off of the innocence displayed by her unaware victims. Once the
picture was clear Hela sent forth a tentacle of power to stealthily worm
its way into the Slayers subconscious to exploit the naive childs
undeserved guilt. </p>

<p>"This is fun!" the living embodiment of evil mumbled to herself, as she
anticipated the torture she was about to inflict on Buffys mind. "It
won't be long till she's mine completely, and there's nothing the
witch-kit can do about it." </p>

<p>Her maniacal laughter filled the air as Hela pushed her power harder
into the unknowing mind of the pure innocent girl. </p>

<p>It was nearly time for the Slayer to feel the full weight of Helas
ability to destroy her will and learn the true meaning of submission.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Giles was in his study his nose buried deep in some ancient tome when he
heard Buffy crying out. He bolted from his chair and charged into the
living room ready to face, and defeat whatever evil was attacking his
Slayer. </p>

<p>For the first time he saw the eerie glow that surrounded the girls as
they slept recuperating from a hard night. </p>

<p>Buffy was tossing her head from side to side and begging someone to
forgive her for something. </p>

<p>As she begged the glow around her began to change from neon green to a
sickly reddish yellow.
The stain spread across the Slayers half of the protective glow very
nearly covering her completely. </p>

<p>Giles was unable to move as he watched the evil looking glow spreading
and Buffy becoming more and more agitated. He knew he should do
something but for some reason he couldn't move or speak. </p>

<p>He was paralysed and helpless as he watched the attack on his surrogate
daughter progressed unabated. Never in his entire life had the
ex-watcher and teacher felt so completely useless. Giles felt nothing
but contempt for himself and the weakness in himself that was powerless
to aid the two people that depended on him to protect them. </p>

<p>Just as the sickly looking glow was about to engulf Buffy completely,
Giles heard Willow mumbling something in her sleep. </p>

<p>"A'nal Na'thrak U'thas Bet'hard Dan'nal Vein'dah." </p>

<p>Giles had no idea what it meant but Willow began chanting it over and
over again. </p>

<p>"A'nal Na'thrak U'thas Bet'hard Dan'nal Vien'dah." </p>

<p>He saw the glow on Willows side of the glow growing brighter each time
she uttered the phrase. Her voice got louder and stronger each time she
repeated the words until it reached its peak. </p>

<p>"A'NAL NA'THRAK U'THAS BET'HARD DAN'NAL VIEN'DAH DAR'GA SAR'ETHA!" </p>

<p>There was a sudden bright flash of light from Willows side of the
surrounding glow, the stain was gone and Buffy was once more sleeping
peacefully. </p>

<p>Giles realized he had just witnessed a mystical attack on them while
they slept, and even more interestingly Willows successful defence
against it. </p>

<p>It was then he realized the seriousness of the mystic threat they faced.
He knew now that they faced a far greater evil than they'd faced before
because there were two of them. </p>

<p>One was coming at them head on meeting them in battle supporting the
dark forces that were attacking them directly. </p>

<p>However, the one he'd just seen was sly and cunning more subtle and
quite possibility far more dangerous. </p>

<p>Giles knew he should hurry and get on the phone to call reinforcements,
but for a few moments all he could do was stare at the small red haired
witch snuggled up against her lover. </p>

<p>He shook his head in wonder at how someone so sweet and innocent could
wield such great power. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;She really has no idea how powerful she truly is.&lt;&gt; he thought
chuckling. &lt;&gt;She has just used an ancient spell from the book that
neither one of us has been able to translate yet, even with Angels help,
and she just used it to protect Buffy in her sleep. Fascinating.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Breaking out of his thoughts Giles got into his roll-a-dex, and began
making calls. They were going to need all the help they could get.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Countess Hela had finally reached the Slayers sleeping subconscious and
was beginning to manipulate the humans dreams. </p>

<p>"This is almost too easy." she cackled to herself. "Kresis wears them
down, and distracts the little witch-kit while I sneak in the back door,
take control of the Slayer, and then through her the little witch-kit." </p>

<p>Watching her intended victim in the glowing red sphere that hovered in
front of her. Hela could feel her magic fingers reaching deep into the
hidden recesses of her preys mind, prying out her deepest secrets and
her darkest fears, bringing them to the surface. Forcing them into her
dreams to torture, and torment the Slayer weakening her defences. Until
Hela could bend the Slayers will to her own. </p>

<p>Suddenly, just as Hela was about to once again take control of the
Slayers subconscious, another force struck out at her. She wasn't sure
where this other power came from but it was stronger than any Hela had
encountered before in this world. It smashed into her own probing magic
power and blew back at her, causing her viewing sphere to explode in a
blinding flash of greenish white light. </p>

<p>The power released by the backlash lifted the demoness off her feet and
threw her across the room into a wall. Hela slid down the wall stunned
by the force that had just hit her. The power released by the blast
shook the entire house. </p>

<p>For the first time in her life Hela knew true fear. She was facing an
unknown factor that was so powerful it had swatted her back like she was
an insignificant insect. </p>

<p>From her brief contact with this power she knew its wielder was female
and she was not of the Darkness. Oh no, this powerful mage was most
decidedly on the side of Light, automatically making her an enemy to be
reckoned with, and Hela had just lost her first battle with it. </p>

<p>Her screams of rage echoed throughout the house, many of the beings
staying there did not live through the day.
The lucky ones.</p>
