<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 19 -->

<p>Harrison sat down in front of the computer and rested his hands on the desk,
pinching the bridge of his nose with his right hand.  He was suppose to edit
the article Sam and he had worked on last week and add captions to the
pictures so that it could be ready to print in the following weeks paper but
he just couldn't seem to do it.  Every time he looked at the article it
reminded him of Sam, and every time he thought of Sam he thought of her and
Brooke, and every time he thought of her and Brooke he became unbelievably
pissed off and it gave him a headache.  When he had left their house a few
days before he had fully intended to be okay with their relationship, but he
found that intentions were easy to hold and hard to achieve.</p>

<p>The thing that really got him was that he could see as plain as day that
they were in love with each other.  He had started watching them with an
almost psychotic interest since he had found out, and that tenderness that
he had observed that day at the house coated their every interaction with
each other.  They reeked of love and the stench was driving him insane.</p>

<p>He was interrupted from his musing only by the sound of a familiar voice
coming from behind him.</p>

<p>"I've given this a lot of consideration and I've decided that your lack of
response to me means one of two things:  Either all of the phones in your
house spontaneously combusted severing all of your contacts to the natural
world, or you're doing a very good job of avoiding me," Sam said steadily as
she walked into the room closing the door behind her.  Harrison had been
avoiding her ever since she had told him about her and Brooke, and while she
was hoping that he would work out whatever he had to work out on his own, it
became clear to her that she had to talk to him.  He was one of her best
friends and she couldn't just leave things the way they were.  She had to at
least try.</p>

<p>"One of those is a winner," Harrison responded removing his hand from his
face but not turning around.</p>

<p>"Can we talk?" Sam asked pulling up a chair beside him and sitting down.</p>

<p>"Isn't that what we're doing?" he asked dismissively.</p>

<p>"Actually I've probably talked more to your mother in the past week than
you," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"I suppose you two would have a lot to talk about," Harrison responded.
"Maybe she could give you some pointers," he continued finally turning
around to face Sam.  His voice was low, his lips set in a hard line and his
eyes accusing.</p>

<p>Sam blinked at him, mildly surprised by the hostility in his voice.  She
wasn't expecting a walk in the park, but she wasn't expecting an outright
attack either.  She wasn't sure who should be more insulted, her or his
mother.  However, since she was the only one of the two present in the room
she decided that she had to represent.</p>

<p>"That was low," she responded softly, turning away from his accusing eyes.
"I know that you're having a hard time with this, I just thought that after
playing together since we were in jumpers, we might be able to have a civil
conversation."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you be at the pep rally ogling the cheerleaders?" Harrison
responded after a moment turning back around so that he was facing the
computer screen once again.</p>

<p>Sam considered him for a moment silently.  She could feel her eyes beginning
to burn and blinked back the tears that were forming in her eyes.  She
wasn't going to let him see what he was doing was her.</p>

<p>"I don't need to be at the pep rally," Sam began in a soft voice, "I can see
all or anything of Brooke whenever I want to," she continued in a haughty
tone reacting to his treatment of her, trying to goad him on.</p>

<p>"How positively Greco-Roman of you," Harrison shot back.  "Your parents must
be so proud."</p>

<p>Sam ran her hand through he hair nervously tugging at the strands anxiously
as she watched Harrison stare aimlessly at the computer screen in front of
him.</p>

<p>"Please don't be like this," she said finally.  "I never meant to hurt you,
neither of us did.  What happened between Brooke and I, it took us by
surprise just as much as anyone else.  I mean it's me, Sam, falling for
Brooke was the equivalent of Lily going to a Texas barbeque.  I didn't want
to, I just couldn't help it," she continued with a somewhat pleading tone in
her voice.  She wanted him to understand what was going on, because she knew
with the way he was feeling only complete honesty about the situation could
abate it.  "And I do love her.  Can you understand that?"</p>

<p>"Good for you.  You love her and she loves you.  That's the way to do it,
believe me things work best that way.  But just because you're walking in
some flowery country paradise of bliss, doesn't mean I'm going to get on the
train and join you," Harrison said turning around to face her once again.
"You said you can't help how you feel…well neither can I.  I don't like it,
I don't want you to be with her, and I can't accept that you're with her and
be peppy and excited about.  Can you understand that?"</p>

<p>"So what?  You're saying that we can't be friends anymore?  That the fact
that I'm with Brooke now negates our entire friendship?  Because if that's
what you're saying than no, I can't understand that.  The world's full of
nasty, ignorant people, I know that.  I just never thought that you were one
of them," Sam responded, the tears she had been holding back escaping from
the confines of her eyes and streaking down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Harrison watched her for a moment, tracking the progress of the tears
falling from her eyes.  He felt himself being torn in two different
directions.  There was the part that saw probably his best friend in the
world crying because of him, that wanted to reach out and wipe her tears
away and hug her telling her that he would work it out and that things would
be okay; fighting against the part of him that saw the girl who stole the
girl he had been in love with and at the same time the girl he could have
seen himself falling in love with stolen by the girl he had always wanted to
be in love with him.</p>

<p>In the end, he found that the pain of what could have been outweighed the
rightness of what should be, and he clinched his jaw and turned away from
her.  He guessed that was what he was saying.</p>

<p>Sam watched him for a moment, then stood up quietly and walked out of the
room.  Apparently that's what he was saying.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Sam flung the blankets off of her body and dark out into the dark room.  She
couldn't sleep.  Every time she tried to fade away into unconsciousness her
mind would drift back to the confrontation she'd had with Harrison in the
afternoon and any chance she'd had of falling asleep would immediately
disappear.  She was so tied up in knots that she could barely lay still.
Unconsciously she turned her head toward Brooke's room.  The blonde had been
gone all day on a company yachting trek with Mike's company, which meant
that Sam had been deprived of her presence all day.  She wasn't even sure if
they had gotten back yet.  Checking her clock she saw that it was just past
three and decided that she would go and check.  She didn't know what she was
going to say or do, only that she at least needed to be around Brooke.  The
blonde just had an uncanny ability to cheer her up.</p>

<p>Leaving the doors between her room, the bathroom and Brooke's room open, Sam
slipped into the blonde's room.  Brooke was indeed in her room, lying on her
bed with her hair splayed out across the pillow, the top of her emerald silk
pajamas just visible above the top of her blanket.  Sam watched her for a
moment, a gentle smile playing across her lips, before she approached the
bed and lifted up the edge of the blanket, slipping in beside Brooke.</p>

<p>
Brooke became hazily aware of the feel of a head resting on her chest and an
arm draping around her waist, and lazily she cracked open one sleepy eye.
What she saw was a mess of brown hair resting just above her left breast and
a pale arm strewn across her stomach.  Turning her head to the side slightly
she placed her lips against Sam's forehead kissing her softly.  She couldn't
see it, but somehow she was absolutely certain that the brunette smiled
before burying her head into Brooke's chest even more.</p>

<p>"I can't sleep," Sam mumbled a moment later as Brooke played idly with her
hair, while sporadically placing butterfly kisses all over Sam's face.</p>

<p>"Is the boogie man under your bed again, because Dad said he had taken care
of that," Brooke responded. Her voice was low with sleep, but that couldn't
hide the gently teasing tone that it carried.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately not this time," Sam responded, her voice barely a whisper but
even at that audibly sad.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Brooke asked shifting her position so that she was now
lying on her side facing Sam.  She had been on the verge of falling asleep
again, but the tone of Sam's face woke her up immediately.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," Sam said lowering her head, effectively breaking eye contact
with Brooke.  Brooke watched her for a moment, it was clear as crystal to
her that whatever was going on was most definitely not nothing.</p>

<p>"It's not nothing," Brooke responded softly, reaching out and placing her
hand on Sam's cheek.  "It's got you upset and that makes it most definitely
something."</p>

<p>Sam didn't respond verbally, instead she chose to close the distance that
had formed between them when Brook turned to face her and draw the blonde
towards her once again.  Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam and held her to
her, bringing Sam with her as she lay back down on her back.  They stayed in
that silence for a long time, Brooke tenderly stroking Sam's back as the
brunette hugged her, so long in fact that Brooke began to think that Sam had
fallen asleep.  But, after ten minutes or so the journalist whispered, "I
saw Harrison today."</p>

<p>"What happened?" Brooke asked already knowing that it would be some
variation of 'I got bitch slapped like a two dollar whore in Harlem', from
the way Sam had been acting.</p>

<p>"This is going to sound fairly schoolyard," Sam started, "but he basically
told me that we couldn't be friends anymore."  Despite the sardonic tone
that she used, Brooke could hear the pain behind her words and shifted again
so that she was facing Sam.  Leaning forward she brought their lips together
softly, then placed her lips next to Sam's ear hugging her.</p>

<p>"He just needs some time," Brooke responded benevolently.  However, as the
words left her mouth she was thinking that what Harrison really needed was a
nice hard slap upside the head, and that she was just woman to deliver it.
Truthfully, she had expected more from him, not to mention the fact that
with Nicole still on the warpath she didn't really want anyone else raining
on their parade.  "Try to get some sleep," Brooke continued a moment later
settling Sam against her, "maybe things will look different when the sun
comes up," she went on resolving to talk to Harrison first thing in the
morning.</p>

<p>"Optimism is an attractive characteristic," Sam mumbled into Brooke's
nightshirt.</p>

<p>"Don't I know it.  I'm just full of attractive characteristics.  In fact I'm
fairly certain that if I only had a little humility I'd be perfect," Brooke
responded grinning down at Sam.  The brunette looked up at her with a stern
expression but couldn't keep it up for long soon dissolving into wearing a
stupid grin herself.  She thought that she might finally be able to get some
sleep.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke placed her arm on Josh's shoulder and told him that she would catch
up with him in a moment.  They were on their way to English class, but
Brooke had spotted Harrison just down the hall and made up her mind to talk
to him then, so that he would have enough time to beg and grovel for Sam's
forgiveness later on in the day.  So, having sent Josh on his way, Brooked
stalked over to Harrison who was leaning against his locker talking to Emory
Dick, and said, "Can we talk?"</p>

<p>"I'm busy, but if you leave your name and number I'll get back to you as
soon as possible," Harrison responded without even turning around to face
the blonde cheerleader standing beside him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to sound like a request," Brooke
responded flatly.  "We're going to talk.  Now."</p>

<p>Harrison simply crossed his arms and stared at her.</p>

<p>"Emory, don't you have an elsewhere to be?" Brooke asked pointedly.
"Because now would be a good time to disappear there," she continued when
the small blond boy hesitated to move.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to him like that," Harrison responded stepping in front of
Brooke's face.</p>

<p>"Like you have any right to be giving me etiquette lessons," Brooke
responded stepping right back up in his.</p>

<p>"What's that suppose to mean?" Harrison asked hotly.  Neither one of them
noticed Emory sneak away.</p>

<p>"Just that you could out bitch me any day of the week," Brooke responded.
"Sam could testify to that."</p>

<p>Harrison stared at her for a moment then turned around and started to walk
down the hall.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it get hard?  You know, running away without a spine?" Brooke asked
following him down the hall.  At that he stopped walking and turned around,
his manly pride wounded by her words.</p>

<p>"Fine, you wanna talk, let's talk," Harrison said opening the door to the
janitors closet and waving Brooke inside.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to talk," Brooke said as he closed the door behind them,
"I want to talk and I want you to listen.  If you want to act like a
self-important asshole that's fine with me as long as you're the only one
your stupidity hurts.  Yesterday, it hurt Sam, which makes it no longer
alright with me.  I know how you feel, despite the protests I can see ready
to spring to your lips, I can comprehend what's going through that pea brain
of yours, and to tell you the truth I really don't give a shit.  I don't
want to get to the root of your issues, and I'm not here to give reassurance
to you manly, heterosexual charms.  I'm here to tell you what's what.  I
love Sam, she loves me, and it's going to take a lot more than someone
acting pissy to break us up.  That means that you have one of two choices,
you can yank the stick out of your ass and remain friends with someone who
you probably don't deserve, or you can firmly grasp said stick and fuck
yourself with it by pushing her away.  To most people this would be a no
brainer, but to be perfectly honest you haven't been impressing me with your
intellectual prowess lately."</p>

<p>"Are you finished?" Harrison asked crossing his arms and giving Brooke the
stink-eye.  He couldn't really do anymore than that in response to her
speech since she had been indignant enough for both of them, thus taking the
wind right out of his sails.  Also that fact that she was right played a
little part in it.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm done," Brooke, responded rather pleased with herself.  She was
feeling very commanding today, and decided that she was going to go have her
bitch fight with Nicole after this.</p>

<p>"Good, so am I," he replied opening the door and walking out, a ghost of a
shadow haunting his face as he made his way down the hall and out of sight.</p>
