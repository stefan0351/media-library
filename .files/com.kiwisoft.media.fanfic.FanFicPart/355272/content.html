<!-- Telling Series \ Section 5: Nicole - And Behind Door Number 3? -->

<p>It had been ten minutes since Nicole had uttered her one sound
and no one had moved. Brooke wasn't sure anyone besides herself was still
breathing. If it weren't for the slight rise and fall of Sam's chest, she would
have been worried about her. As it was, she was worried about the shock still
form of her former best friend sitting across from her. Nicole hadn't moved an
inch. Brooke wasn't sure the girl had blinked in the space of time since Sam had
finished speaking. She was still staring straight ahead, apparently unseeing.
Brooke was waiting for her to shoot across the space between them and wrap her
arms around Sam's neck to try and finish the job she started with her car or
something equally horrible. </p>
<p>"Uhm, Nic?" Brooke finally spoke, unable to take the harsh
silence anymore. "Are you OK?" Nicole tore her eyes from whatever faraway point
they'd been at and focused them at the couple in front of her. She blinked at
them for a few more minutes, still not speaking. Brooke shifted in Sam's arms,
nervous. </p>
<p>"Earth to Nicole," Sam spoke up, sensing and agreeing with
Brooke's nervousness. Nicole was getting spooky. And that was a very scary
thing. "Can you speak or have you had a stroke? Do you smell burning toast?"
Brooke elbowed her in the ribs. </p>
<p>"Knock off the jokes, Sam, she's really freaked," Brooke
hissed. </p>
<p>"At least she didn't faint three times like Carmen," Sam
pointed out calmly. "No need to get all worked up yet Brooke, she hasn't reacted
yet." </p>
<p>"Carmen fainted three times?" Nicole asked quietly, startling
both the girls by finally speaking. She wasn't looking at either of them anymore
but instead seemed more interested in studying the condition of her Prada heels.
(Hmm?toe's scuffed, can't have that. Need a new pair) </p>
<p>"Out cold on the floor of the Novac," Sam piped up, glad that
the girl had remembered how to speak at last. Nicole looked up at them again and
they were surprised to see the fear on Nicole's face. Disgust, outrage or
repulsion they were prepared for but fear? (What the heck is she afraid of?)
Brooke wondered. </p>
<p>"That's surprising. I would have thought she would have
supported you," Nicole said, her voice still soft. </p>
<p>"She and Harrison have some issues to work out about it,"
Brooke confessed sadly. She missed Carmen and Harrison's company and knew Sam
did as well. And now she was worried about what Nicole was going to do.
</p>
<p>"Who else knows?" Nicole asked, again looking away, studying
the room instead. Sam and Brooke exchanged wary glances. This was way too calm
to be the real Nicole Julian. (Would the real Nicole Julian please stand up?)
Sam laughed to herself hearing the notes from the Eminem song. </p>
<p>"Mom, and Lily and Josh. Sugar found out by accident. They all
took it really well, Sugar even took us out to dinner," Brooke told her. Nicole
nodded. </p>
<p>"That's good," she said absently. </p>
<p>"What about you, Nic?" Sam asked, getting right to the point.
Nicole focused her blue eyes on her. "What are you going to do about this now?
Are you going to try and use this against us, try and hurt Brooke and her
popularity with it? I can't possibly get anymore unpopular aside from sitting
with April Tuna and Freddy Gong and Harrison and Carmen have beaten me to that.
You know there's nothing you can do to hurt me with it," She watched the flash
of hurt that went across Nicole's eyes and it surprised her. </p>
<p>"I wondered why they were lowering themselves further on the
food chain lately. Anyway, I deserved that, Sam, and yes, at one time, I
probably would have jumped at this little tidbit of info to use it was a way of
leapfrogging my way to the top of the social ladder and to Hell with anyone's
feelings." </p>
<p>"But now?" Brooke asked. Nicole shrugged. </p>
<p>"Now? Now who you chose to love is no one's business but your
own. What goes on behind closed doors is your business, not the general populace
of Kennedy High School." She looked at the two shocked faces before her and
laughed. "So no, I'm not going to go parading around the halls tomorrow singing
`Brooke and Sammy sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g' at the top of my lungs. It'd
be rude and tasteless, not to mention I have the worst singing voice," she
continued with a small smile. Brooke let out a sigh of utter relief that was
echoed by Sam. </p>
<p>"But how do you feel about it, Nic?" Brooke asked. "We know
how everyone else, except Mary Cherry, feels, good and bad. Now we want your
opinion." </p>
<p>"Not your blessing," Sam clarified. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to go screaming from the room like you suddenly
ordered me to wear last years Jacklyn Smith fashions, hon, if that's what you
mean. So your sexual preference doesn't qualify as `norm'. Big deal. Neither
does my hair color." Everyone laughed at this. </p>
<p>"So you're not freaked?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"I didn't say that. The thought that my best friend and the
biggest pain in my ass play tonsil hockey and probably get horizontal on a
regular basis," she paused and looked at the two blushing girls, "and those
blushes tell me way more than I need to know. But as I was saying, the thought
alone is enough to disturb me and make me wonder about the natural order of the
universe but, a lot of shit makes me do that lately. No big." She looked at the
two smiles that looked back at her. </p>
<p>"I take it you're happy with my answer?" </p>
<p>"Given that we've already lost two good friends and expected
to have you flip out on us, we're pleasantly surprised, Nic," Brooke said, still
grinning. Sam nodded her agreement. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I'm working on the whole freaking out and running
around and trying to kill people problem I used to have" Nicole said wryly. Sam
looked at Brooke with a (See? I'm not the only one who makes bad jokes about it)
look on her face that won her a smack on the arm. </p>
<p>"Wow, this really is a whole new you, Nicole," Brooke pointed
out amazed. Nicole shrugged. </p>
<p>"Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you have to take
love and acceptance where you can find it. One of the reasons I acted the way I
did for so long is because I didn't get any love at home and mistook fear and
worship for it. But if you two found it with each other, good for you. And I
want you as friends and this is part of the package, OK, I can deal."
</p>
<p>"That is so mature," Sam said in disbelief, she just couldn't
believe these words were coming from the same Nicole Julian who had made her
life such a living Hell for so long. And she wasn't even thinking about the
whole accident thing. </p>
<p>"Yeah, a real kick in the ass, ain't it? It's amazing what
therapy can do for a person. Anyway, I just hope you feel the same way. Because,
if you're going to be so honest with me, I have to be honest with you," Nic said
seriously. Sam looked at Brooke and shrugged. </p>
<p>"OK, Nic, what's up?" Brooke asked. Nicole leaned forward and
rested her hands on her knees as she stared intently at the two girls in front
of her. The spark of unfamiliar fear was back in her eyes. </p>
<p>"I don't know how to tell you this, Brooke, Sam, but I'm going
to be honest and just say it. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm
bisexual," Nicole confessed in a rush, just to get the words out of her mouth
before she chickened out completely. She looked at Sam who was still staring at
her, one eyebrow trying to climb up off her forehead. Sam turned away a few
seconds later to check on the prone form of Brooke who had fainted dead away on
the couch beside her right after Nicole had finished speaking. After making sure
Brooke was OK, Sam turned back to Nicole with a smirk on her face. Nicole looked
even more slightly panicked. </p>
<p>"I think you broke her." (Maybe there is something in the
drinking water because this is going to kill Harrison) </p>
