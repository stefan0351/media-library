<!-- For the Love of Miss Bard \ Part 3-->

<P>Friday morning Alex and Sam walked to school.
  The sun was bright and the air was warm with the remaining days of summer quickly
  fading away. Alex was wearing a pair of running shorts and a tank top. Sam was
  dressed in a little blue dress with a white blouse.</P>
<P>"Good morning Miss Bard" Alex said as she opened
  the gated door for Sam to walk through.</P>
<P>Miss Bard was standing at the entrance greeting
  the children as they came in. "Hi, are we still on for tonight?" she whispered
  in a conspiratorial tone. </P>
<P>"Yes, we are. Alex whispered back as she shifted
  her eyes from place to place to make sure she wasn't heard by anyone save the
  conspiratress. </P>
<P>"Shut up." Kathryn said as she slapped at Alex's
  forearm. </P>
<P>They both started laughing.</P>
<P>Alex turned to walk away, but just as she turned
  her head back, she caught Kathryn contemplating as she was sneaking a peek at
  the robust rear that was Alex's. Hmm, what's this I see. Alex grinned as she
  saw the interest Kathryn had made quite obviously.</P>
<P>Kathryn didn't look up to see Alex' face, due
  to the student that walked up to her. She greeted the youngster and they both
  headed toward the playground. </P>
<P>Alex went home and tried to get some work done.
  She had a pair of earphones on and was listening to one of the doctor's dictate
  a consultation report. </P>
<P>Her mind kept drifting back to a certain kindergarten
  teacher. Alex felt a sudden tightness in the lower region of her body. She realized
  she was no longer typing. As she removed her foot from the pedal of the transcribing
  machine, she squeezed her inner thighs together. "Oh God." She moaned. "I gotta
  get out of here." She pushed the chair back and got up to obtain her house keys.
  She stood shortly with an air of irresolution, finally deciding the best way
  to relieve some of the built up tension would be to run it off. </P>
<P>As the noon hour came upon the sunny sky, Miss
  Bard elected to let the children out into the playground a few minutes earlier
  than usual. She was having some difficulty concentrating in class. She wanted
  to call her father and reschedule their dinner plans she had completely forgotten
  about until earlier that morning.</P>
<P>Most of the parents were waiting outside the
  encased playground and classrooms. Miss Bard began dismissing the anxious students
  just as the school bell rang. Frank, Tracy's father decided Miss Bard would
  be the lucky lady who would accompany him to a Rolling Stones concert he had
  tickets for. </P>
<P>"So Miss Bard, How'z bout you and I get together
  t'night for some dinner and a concert?" He confidently asked as if she had but
  only one answer. </P>
<P>"Excuse?" she uttered with surprise</P>
<P>"The Rolling Stones, they're gonna be at the
  Amphitheater, I have back stage passes." He spoke as his eyes moved up and down
  trailing her entire body seductively.</P>
<P>"Thank you, but I don't think so." She replied
  with a definite tone. </P>
<P>"What, you involved with somebody?" He sarcastically
  remarked as if she had no right.</P>
<P>"That's really is none of your business Mr.
  Walker." She spoke glaringly at him.</P>
<P>"Yea, well, next time honey. You change your
  mind, you know where ta find me." He grinned then called to his daughter who
  was playing Sam. </P>
<P>"Tch." Kathryn shook her head. Yea, if he only
  knew. </P>
<P>Just then, Alex came running to the gate. The
  sweat trickled down her forehead. It sheathed over her exposed skin giving her
  an illuminating cast of shine. "Hey." She huffed.</P>
<P>Wow, how can she look so sexy from sweating.
  "Hey yourself." Kathryn spoke collectively, all the while her insides were a
  bundle of nerves. </P>
<P>Alex was also trying desperately to hide the
  anxiety that took over once she was in range of the beautifully, intriguing
  Miss Bard. </P>
<P>"Talk about dedication." Kathryn grinned. </P>
<P>"Yea, I had a lot of um, energy I needed to
  burn off. So do you want me to meet you at your place?"</P>
<P>"Sounds great. About six?" Kathryn hesitantly
  replied. </P>
<P>"Sure, come on honey your going to grandma's
  tonight remember." Alex swooped Sam up and kissed her on the cheek.</P>
<P>"See you two later."</P>

<hr>

<P>Alex dropped Sam off at her mother's house,
  then drove to Kathryn's. It was exactly six o'clock.</P>
<P>Kathryn opened the door before Alex could even
  ring the bell. </P>
<P>Alex jumped. "Oh I see your ready to go." </P>
<P>"Yea, come on I'm hungry and I know a great
  little place we can go to. You like Mexican?"</P>
<P>"Sure, shall we?" Alex led the way to her car.
  Kathryn followed behind. </P>
<P>A couple of margaritas later dinner arrived.
  "Wow, you gonna eat all that?" Alex asked as a bounteous burrito was set in
  front of Kathryn. </P>
<P>"Oh, I could eat this day and night." She spoke
  then shoved a forkful of food into her mouth. "Hmm." She moaned.</P>
<P>The pair were seated in a booth across from
  each other which allowed for a comfortable closeness. They were able to lean
  toward each other to talk giving them the opportunity to gaze without the least
  bit feeling of awkwardness. Kathryn began to loosen up and found she was unable
  to control her hands. She reached over the table for some salsa and purposely
  brushed against Alex's forearm. Alex felt all the little hairs on her arm tingle
  as they were jolted by Kathryn's touch.</P>
<P>"Oops." Kathryn apologetically spoke, but the
  look in her eyes in no way said she was sorry</P>
<P>"That's OK." Alex replied consciously aware
  of what was going on. She wants to play.</P>
<P>Alex watched as Kathryn turned to look at another
  woman who had just walked into the small restaurant. She followed her gaze.
  The woman was about Kathryn's height; her hair was long and brilliantly black.
  The woman looked over and caught Kathryn's stare. She immediately grew a wide
  smile that exposed a set of pearly white teeth.</P>
<P>For some reason Alex felt a burning inside the
  pit of her stomach. She didn't like the look of admiration the woman returned
  to Kathryn. </P>
<P>"Hey Paul." Kathryn called to the copper colored
  woman. </P>
<P>"K." she joyously returned as she walked to
  the table. </P>
<P>K. What's up with that? Alex didn't like the
  nickname, I thought all her good friends called her Kat. She silently thought.
  </P>
<P>Kathryn got out of her seat and the two embraced
  like long lost friends. "How the hell have you been?" Kathryn asked still holding
  to the woman. </P>
<P>"Good, I haven't seen you around lately. So
  I guess you started school huh?" the woman said then smiled at Alex.</P>
<P>"Yea, just recently. Oh I'm so sorry this is
  Alex Trout, she's a um parent of one of my students." Kathryn sputtered out
  before she realized how that must have sounded to Alex.</P>
<P>A parent huh. "Hi how do you do" Alex smiled
  hiding the sting that just slapped at her.</P>
<P>"Alex this is Dr. Prescott&#133; Pauline."</P>
<P>"Hi, Paul. is fine." She said taking a step
  away from Kathryn. </P>
<P>Paul. OK. They must have gone to school together.
  "So same alma mater?" Alex curiously asked.</P>
<P>"No actually we met at an um&#133;UH&#133;Pauline
  started to say before she was nudged in the side with an elbow.</P>
<P>"Where just old friends." Kathryn cut her off.
  </P>
<P>"Yea, very good &#133; old &#133; friends."
  Pauline replied then winked at Kathryn. </P>
<P>Alex was amazed at the different shades of red
  that creeped over Kathryn's face and neck.</P>
<P>"I see." Was all she said.</P>
<P>The three women looked over to another person
  who called to Pauline. "Come over here sweetheart." Pauline replied in Spanish.
  </P>
<P>The younger woman walked over and stood at the
  side of the Ph.D. she was taller than Kat, do to her heels but not by much.
  Her hair was a long golden blonde and her eyes as green as Kathryn's. </P>
<P>"This is Maria, Pauline introduced.</P>
<P>Maria didn't speak English so the good doctor
  translated in Spanish. It just so happens that Alex understood what was said.
  Pauline told Maria that Kathryn was the one she used to date, but it was nothing
  serious. </P>
<P>Maria looked over Kathryn and raised an eyebrow.
  "Ella es muy bonita" Maria said.</P>
<P>"Yes she is." Alex interrupted in Spanish. </P>
<P>"Ah you speak Spanish?" Pauline Asked</P>
<P>"Yes, fluently. The corporation I used to work
  for had me stationed in Mexico for a year setting up new offices." Alex spoke
  so that both Pauline and Maria understood.</P>
<P>"So then you understood what I said, please
  forgive my stupidity, but it was for Maria's benefit." Pauline replied.</P>
<P>"It's OK, its good to see that your very open
  and honest about your relationship." Alex suggested admirably. </P>
<P>"Well it's the only way I know how to be." </P>
<P>"Hey, you two have me lost here." Kathryn said
  feeling like an outsider. </P>
<P>"Oh, sorry." Alex said returning to her native
  tongue. </P>
<P>"Well, our food is ready to go, so we'll be
  seen you." Pauline said as she reached out to hug Kathryn. She and Alex then
  exchanged handshakes. Maria just nodded her good-byes.</P>
<P>"Come on, let's get out of here." Alex said
  suddenly feeling a bit lighthearted at this new revelation.</P>
<P>The women decided to walk to the movie show
  since it was just a few blocks away.</P>
<P>"So how long did you date Pauline?" Alex asked
  rather nonchalantly. </P>
<P>"What?" Kathryn spit out although she heard
  exactly what Alex asked. </P>
<P>"Dated?"</P>
<P>"Um is that what you two were talking about?"
  Kathryn spoke angrily. </P>
<P>"Hey, I'm just curious, I figure I don't really
  have a chance anyway being a PARENT and all."</P>
<P>It took Kathryn a moment to digest what Alex
  just said. She stopped dead in her tracks and reached for Alex's shoulder. "I'm
  sorry about that, I didn't know how to introduce you."</P>
<P>"Well, a friend would have been a nice start."
  Alex spoke softly. </P>
<P>"Yea, I'm sorry, I really didn't want you to
  find out this way. I really like you so I figured I'd see, and if we became
  better friends I would have told you." She whispered the last part.</P>
<P>"Hey, it's alright. I was just asking. Don't
  worry, I like you too. I hope that we could be good friends. I haven't really
  had a good friend since before Sammy was born."</P>
<P>Kathryn grew a very large smile, "Really?" </P>
<P>"Yes, really." Alex said as she resumed her
  walking with Kathryn following behind.</P>
<P>"HEY." Kathryn called again coming to a stop.
  "What did you mean since you didn't have a chance anyway?"</P>
<P>Alex looked back, she had a grin on her face
  as she raised one of her eyebrows questioningly. Her eyes moved down then back
  up the length of Kathryn's body as if she were devouring every bit to memory.
  She turned and continued to walk without saying a word. </P>
<P>Kathryn stood there for a moment taking in what
  was not said. She swallowed hard.</P>
<P>"You coming?" Alex purred.</P>
<P>The younger woman jogged a few steps to catch
  up. She didn't say another word. </P>
<P>"So, whatcha want to see?" Alex asked looking
  up at the large menu display of movie titles.</P>
<P>"I don't know nothing scary though." Kathryn
  said. </P>
<P>The two women walked into the smaller theater
  and sat, placing the popcorn in between them. Alex liked Angelica Houston and
  suggested 'Agnes Browne.' Kathryn didn't mind since she had seen most of the
  movies that were showing there anyway.</P>
<P>In the midst of the movie two sets of hands
  kept brushing with electrical touches across one another while mingling in an
  array of salts, butter and popped&#133;corn.</P>
<P>Alex found her hand lingering a bit longer in
  the tub of popped corn awaiting the feathery touch of Kathryn's fingertips.
  She smiled as the young teacher would reach in and purposely, gently brush by
  Alex' hand then look up and grin.</P>
<P>Damn, she is just too cute. Alex thought. Well,
  now I know she's gay, so how do I tell her about me? Should I tell her everything?
  What about Sammy, it might make her feel uncomfortable, but she really likes
  her, she's also her teacher&#133; oh boy.. Alex was looking up at the screen,
  but she wasn't watching the movie.</P>
<P>Kathryn looked over to her seated companion;
  she could feel her heart begin to quicken. How can I feel like this for someone
  I just met? She puzzled over this idea.</P>
<P>Alex felt Kathryn's gaze and looked over to
  see a smile ever so subtle, yet filled with affection. She realized she wanted
  to kiss those lips and run her fingers softly through the short golden locks.
  She quickly turned her head and tried desperately to focus on the movie. </P>
<P>The night was cool and breezy, there was an
  air of activity throughout the Marketplace as the two friends walked back to
  the vehicle. Kathryn found she was still clutching the tissue that absorbed
  the seemingly endless amount of tears that ran down her face.</P>
<P>"You OK?" Alex found she was sorry for picking
  such a mushy ol' movie. </P>
<P>"Oh, yea, I always get like this with these
  kinds of movies." Kathryn said between blowing her nose. "I'm such a baby, but
  I can't help it." </P>
<P>Alex found that she liked this side of Kathryn.
  She had always thought it was silly of people to cry at movies, they are just
  movies. Nevertheless, seeing Kathryn react as she did touched some where deep
  inside of Alex. In between her heartbeats she felt a flutter. "Hmm" she sighed.
  </P>
<P>The drive home was quiet but not awkward. Alex
  had the radio playing softly in the background and she was humming to the music.
  Kathryn felt a peaceful comfort, she relaxed into the seat and closed her eyes.
  </P>
<P>Alex drove up to the driveway. "Here we are."
  </P>
<P>Kathryn opened her eyes and breathed in deeply.
  "So, what are you going to do tomorrow?"</P>
<P>Alex put the car in park but left the engine
  running. "I don't really have anything to do. My mom and Sammy were going to
  go to the zoo." </P>
<P>"You're not going to go with them?" Kathryn
  asked taking off her seatbelt and turning to the side to face Alex.</P>
<P>Alex noticed Kathryn getting comfortable in
  the car which made her smile. She turned off the engine and released her seatbelt.
  "I hadn't really thought about it. Usually my mom takes Sammy and they make
  plans to do things. I try and get some work done while they're gone." She readjusted
  herself so the side of her head could rest against the seat. "I was actually
  able to get a lot of work done this week while Sammy was in school." </P>
<P>The mention of school brought Kathryn back to
  the realization that Alex was her student's parent. She tried to shake the idea
  of leaning over and kissing Alex. However, those blue eyes were so inviting.
  She found herself leaning closer to the dark haired driver. Oh God, what am
  I doing? Kathryn jolted backward.</P>
<P>Alex felt her pulse quicken as Kathryn came
  closer, she wanted her too. She felt Kathryn jolt as she backed off. Her heart
  was still racing. She's having second thoughts. Ok just be honest with her.
  </P>
<P>"Um&#133; Kathryn?"</P>
<P>Kathryn sat staring out the window looking beyond
  the garage door into a voided space. "Yea" she spoke with melancholy. </P>
<P>"Can I be honest with you?" Alex whispered.
  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh boy, here it comes, Kathryn felt her stomach
  knot up. "Sure," she spoke with a deep sigh.</P>
<P>"Ok," Alex breathed, "I-um, I really like you
  and I want to be friends with you&#133;" Alex paused.</P>
<P>"But it's a problem because I'm gay and I'm
  your daughter's teacher," Kathryn interjected hastily.</P>
<P>"What&#133; no, it's not a problem," Alex spoke
  confusingly. She thinks it's a problem. Alex saw the worried look on Kathryn's
  face. "No, I like you, I did from the first time I saw you&#133; and I um, well,
  I really want to get to know you better." Alex let out the rest of her breath.
  </P>
<P>"You do," now it was Kathryn who looked confused.
  </P>
<P>"Is that so hard to believe." Alex spoke with
  credence. </P>
<P>"Well, kinda, yea&#133; I expected you to well,
  you know." Kathryn laughed out nervously.</P>
<P>"What, kick you out of my car and not speak
  to you again?" </P>
<P>"No, I don't think you'd do that, but, it's
  just that only my close friends know who I really am. Because of my job, it's
  not something I talk about. Not that I'm ashamed of who I am, but it's just&#133;
  well, with work." Kathryn felt herself mumbling.</P>
<P>"It's OK, I can understand how hard it must
  be for you, especially being a teacher. You'd sure cause a commotion. Probably
  end up on the eight O'clock news." Alex shook her head trying to imagine the
  headlines. </P>
<P>"Yea, I remember a story about a math teacher
  who was fired by the school board."</P>
<P>"For being gay, they can't do that." Alex felt
  an anger growing inside her, but she knew all to well the realities of society.
  </P>
<P>"No, they can't, but they can get you on other
  things." Kathryn thought about being in that position. "It's frustrating, how
  the board and parents want teachers to be the perfect person around their children.
  They expect us to be non human I guess, have no life after school hours." </P>
<P>Alex let out a snort. "Yea I guess parents do
  expect you to be straight laced and one-hundred percent teacher all the time.
  It must be hard?" </P>
<P>"Not really for me, though, I've never really
  had much of a relationship with anyone, so I didn't have to hide anything."
  </P>
<P>"What about Pauline?" Alex asked with a bit
  of surprise. </P>
<P>"Well to tell the truth, I met her a few summers
  ago at a bar called Peaches." </P>
<P>"I know Peaches," Alex interrupted rather hastily.
  </P>
<P>"You do?" Kathryn said as her eyebrows narrowed
  in a questioning manner. </P>
<P>"Well, I haven't been there for a long while,
  I used to&#133; you know before Sammy was born."</P>
<P>Now Kathryn really looked confused.</P>
<P>"Kathryn!" Alex interjected "I'm gay too. Hello,
  didn't you feel my responding to your little um," she cleared her throat, "unintentional
  brushes, I thought I was a bit obvious there didn't you?" </P>
<P>"I was getting mixed feeling. I didn't want
  to let my self, you know...ya know!" Kathryn spoke while rolling her eyes. "But
  what about Sammy her father...I mean, I hope I'm not prying?" </P>
<P>"No you're not prying. I used to work for a
  corporation down town. I was one of three Associate Directors, and I was up
  for VP, it was between me and another guy. Anyway we had this account we were
  bidding for and the one who landed it would most likely be promoted. The owner
  of the company we were bidding on, for what ever the reason had taken an interest
  in me." Alex paused.</P>
<P>"For what ever the reason?" Kathryn interrupted,
  "Alex come on, I mean look at you, you're beautiful."</P>
<P>Alex smiled and softly said thanks. "Anyway,
  I took advantage of this opportunity, it was stupid, the only reason I even
  considered sleeping with this guy was to get that damned promotion." </P>
<P>"You didn't use protection?" Kathryn sounded
  worried as her eyes widened. </P>
<P>"Yea I did, I made him, but somehow I guess
  it broke and&#133; well two months later I found out I was pregnant."</P>
<P>"Oh Alex."</P>
<P>"No, it was a good thing. I would have never
  even thought of having a baby, especially since I had no desires to be with
  a man. But honestly I was glad, I was amazed, and it was wonderful being pregnant.
  It just felt right." </P>
<P>"Really?" Kathryn now sounded excited.</P>
<P>"Yea, I wouldn't change anything that happened.
  What really pissed me off though was that I landed that account and still was
  passed over. So I decided to quit and find something I could do without interrupting
  Sam's routine. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I really believe
  that it was meant to be this way." Alex had a glow of pure love for her daughter
  as she spoke about her.</P>
<P>"What about Sam's father, what happened to him?"
  </P>
<P>"I didn't want to tell him at first, but my
  mom kept insisting that he had a right to know his child, so we got together
  for lunch one day and he was surprised to see me pregnant. I told him it was
  his. He turned so pale, I though he was going to pass out right there. Then
  he told me he couldn't have anything to do with me or the child because he was
  married and his wife was the actual owner of the business, if she ever found
  out about this it would ruin him. I was relieved and decided that I could live
  with that. When Sammy turned a year old, I received a bunch of money orders
  with Sam's name on them. She gets them every year now. No return address or
  name, or note of any kind, which is fine with me. I figure when Sam's old enough
  if she wants to know, then I'll tell her."</P>
<P>"Wow, at least he sends money, I know a lot
  of guys who wouldn't." Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Yea, I was a bit surprised myself, maybe because
  he didn't have any kids with his wife."</P>
<P>"Really."</P>
<P>"Ah, yea really" Alex laughed looking at Kathryn's
  concerned expression. "Hey! How did we end up talking about me?" </P>
<P>"I don't know, but I'm glad you told me. Do
  you think there'll come a time when he'd want to see her?"</P>
<P>Alex thought about that, "only time will tell...
  I don't know" Kathryn smiled as she leaned a bit closer to Alex. </P>
<P>"Well you know, I've never really talked about
  this before with anyone other than my mother. But you, you somehow make me feel&#133;I
  don't know, just comfortable I guess." Alex slid down a little in the seat so
  that now she and Kathryn were almost touching.</P>
<P>Both women sat relaxed in the car like they
  were at a drive-in movie. Neither one said a word. The garage door was a blank
  screen for which both had settled in to watch.</P>
<P>"Alex?" Kathryn turned her head slightly to
  see the dark-haired woman's profile.</P>
<P>"Hmm."</P>
<P>"Would you like to kiss me?"</P>
<P>Alex turned to meet green eyes filled with a
  deepening desire. She breathed in a hesitant amount of air, released it then
  tilted her head a bit and ever-so-slowly brought her lips down on Kathryn's.
  </P>
<P>Kathryn breathed in with her nose as she tasted
  the warm, moist juices of saliva that penetrated her own damp lips. She opened
  her mouth acceptingly as Alex moved her tongue in to begin the dance of the
  lingua. In unison they danced as a heat began to rise, moisture and friction
  caused sparks to ignite a flame of passion that would become impossible to put
  out. </P>
<P>Slowly the dancers began to pull away, hearts
  racing, breaths heaving, organs of taste pulsating, wanting, and needing. </P>
<P>Kathryn was lost, her head was spinning, and
  her brain was not working. Slowly she began to come back to her senses. She
  opened her eyes to see Alex in a similar state. "Wow!" she swallowed hard, "Alex,
  I've never felt anything so intense before. I mean I've heard people say that
  one kiss could knock you off you feet, but I would'a never believed it&#133;"
  Kathryn was mumbling.</P>
<P>Alex opened her eyes, "Whered'ya learn to kiss
  like that? Come here." Alex leaned over and started another dance, not waiting
  for an answer. </P>
<P>Kathryn was more than happy to oblige.</P>
<P>What seemed like minutes turned quickly into
  a few hours as these two newfound companions did what others were doing all
  over this inhabited planet. But the question was, how far would they go? </P>
<P>"God I feel like I'm in high school making out
  with the head cheerleader." Alex said after her lips pulled away from Kathryn's.
  </P>
<P>"You were with the head cheerleader?"</P>
<P>"No, I wanted to be, but she liked the quarterback
  and I couldn't well be him." Alex chuckled. "So I settled for the drill team
  leader." </P>
<P>"Well I had a thing for my English teacher.
  She was tall, dark and very beautiful." Kathryn spoke realizing that Alex had
  similar features save for the blue eyes. Mrs. Bernard had light brown eyes.
  </P>
<P>"So did anything happen?" Alex asked as she
  raised her eyebrows up and down. </P>
<P>"Yea, Mrs. Bernard had twins."</P>
<P>Alex began to laugh. Kathryn joined in and soon
  both were uncontrollably holding each other's sides.</P>
<P>As the laughter subsided, Kathryn stifled a
  yawn. She leaned her head into Alex's shoulder and let out a long sigh. </P>
<P>"So&#133;you wanna come in?"</P>
<P>Alex raised one eye brow in contemplation. "I
  don't know if that would be a good idea, I mean, well, do you want me to come
  in?" she spoke with hesitation. "Maybe we should take it slowly?" she answered
  before Kathryn could say anything.</P>
<P>"Well, if that's what you really want to do,
  but, I figured we could just talk a little while longer and maybe have some
  coffee. It's still early." Kathryn's voice seeped with disappointment as she
  looked at her watch it read ten-thirty.</P>
<P>"Yea, what am I saying. I guess I'm used to
  going to bed early because of Sam. Beside, she's spending the night with grandma.
  So why do I feel like I have a curfew or something? Yea, let's have some coffee."
  </P>
<P>Kathryn stared at Alex letting her finish her
  own debate before she got out of the car. Both women went inside and Alex settled
  down on the sofa in the living room. Kathryn went into the kitchen to put on
  a pot of coffee.</P>

<!-- End -->
<P>Friday morning Alex and Sam walked to school.
  The sun was bright and the air was warm with the remaining days of summer quickly
  fading away. Alex was wearing a pair of running shorts and a tank top. Sam was
  dressed in a little blue dress with a white blouse.</P>
<P>"Good morning Miss Bard" Alex said as she opened
  the gated door for Sam to walk through.</P>
<P>Miss Bard was standing at the entrance greeting
  the children as they came in. "Hi, are we still on for tonight?" she whispered
  in a conspiratorial tone. </P>
<P>"Yes, we are. Alex whispered back as she shifted
  her eyes from place to place to make sure she wasn't heard by anyone save the
  conspiratress. </P>
<P>"Shut up." Kathryn said as she slapped at Alex's
  forearm. </P>
<P>They both started laughing.</P>
<P>Alex turned to walk away, but just as she turned
  her head back, she caught Kathryn contemplating as she was sneaking a peek at
  the robust rear that was Alex's. Hmm, what's this I see. Alex grinned as she
  saw the interest Kathryn had made quite obviously.</P>
<P>Kathryn didn't look up to see Alex' face, due
  to the student that walked up to her. She greeted the youngster and they both
  headed toward the playground. </P>
<P>Alex went home and tried to get some work done.
  She had a pair of earphones on and was listening to one of the doctor's dictate
  a consultation report. </P>
<P>Her mind kept drifting back to a certain kindergarten
  teacher. Alex felt a sudden tightness in the lower region of her body. She realized
  she was no longer typing. As she removed her foot from the pedal of the transcribing
  machine, she squeezed her inner thighs together. "Oh God." She moaned. "I gotta
  get out of here." She pushed the chair back and got up to obtain her house keys.
  She stood shortly with an air of irresolution, finally deciding the best way
  to relieve some of the built up tension would be to run it off. </P>
<P>As the noon hour came upon the sunny sky, Miss
  Bard elected to let the children out into the playground a few minutes earlier
  than usual. She was having some difficulty concentrating in class. She wanted
  to call her father and reschedule their dinner plans she had completely forgotten
  about until earlier that morning.</P>
<P>Most of the parents were waiting outside the
  encased playground and classrooms. Miss Bard began dismissing the anxious students
  just as the school bell rang. Frank, Tracy's father decided Miss Bard would
  be the lucky lady who would accompany him to a Rolling Stones concert he had
  tickets for. </P>
<P>"So Miss Bard, How'z bout you and I get together
  t'night for some dinner and a concert?" He confidently asked as if she had but
  only one answer. </P>
<P>"Excuse?" she uttered with surprise</P>
<P>"The Rolling Stones, they're gonna be at the
  Amphitheater, I have back stage passes." He spoke as his eyes moved up and down
  trailing her entire body seductively.</P>
<P>"Thank you, but I don't think so." She replied
  with a definite tone. </P>
<P>"What, you involved with somebody?" He sarcastically
  remarked as if she had no right.</P>
<P>"That's really is none of your business Mr.
  Walker." She spoke glaringly at him.</P>
<P>"Yea, well, next time honey. You change your
  mind, you know where ta find me." He grinned then called to his daughter who
  was playing Sam. </P>
<P>"Tch." Kathryn shook her head. Yea, if he only
  knew. </P>
<P>Just then, Alex came running to the gate. The
  sweat trickled down her forehead. It sheathed over her exposed skin giving her
  an illuminating cast of shine. "Hey." She huffed.</P>
<P>Wow, how can she look so sexy from sweating.
  "Hey yourself." Kathryn spoke collectively, all the while her insides were a
  bundle of nerves. </P>
<P>Alex was also trying desperately to hide the
  anxiety that took over once she was in range of the beautifully, intriguing
  Miss Bard. </P>
<P>"Talk about dedication." Kathryn grinned. </P>
<P>"Yea, I had a lot of um, energy I needed to
  burn off. So do you want me to meet you at your place?"</P>
<P>"Sounds great. About six?" Kathryn hesitantly
  replied. </P>
<P>"Sure, come on honey your going to grandma's
  tonight remember." Alex swooped Sam up and kissed her on the cheek.</P>
<P>"See you two later."</P>

<hr>

<P>Alex dropped Sam off at her mother's house,
  then drove to Kathryn's. It was exactly six o'clock.</P>
<P>Kathryn opened the door before Alex could even
  ring the bell. </P>
<P>Alex jumped. "Oh I see your ready to go." </P>
<P>"Yea, come on I'm hungry and I know a great
  little place we can go to. You like Mexican?"</P>
<P>"Sure, shall we?" Alex led the way to her car.
  Kathryn followed behind. </P>
<P>A couple of margaritas later dinner arrived.
  "Wow, you gonna eat all that?" Alex asked as a bounteous burrito was set in
  front of Kathryn. </P>
<P>"Oh, I could eat this day and night." She spoke
  then shoved a forkful of food into her mouth. "Hmm." She moaned.</P>
<P>The pair were seated in a booth across from
  each other which allowed for a comfortable closeness. They were able to lean
  toward each other to talk giving them the opportunity to gaze without the least
  bit feeling of awkwardness. Kathryn began to loosen up and found she was unable
  to control her hands. She reached over the table for some salsa and purposely
  brushed against Alex's forearm. Alex felt all the little hairs on her arm tingle
  as they were jolted by Kathryn's touch.</P>
<P>"Oops." Kathryn apologetically spoke, but the
  look in her eyes in no way said she was sorry</P>
<P>"That's OK." Alex replied consciously aware
  of what was going on. She wants to play.</P>
<P>Alex watched as Kathryn turned to look at another
  woman who had just walked into the small restaurant. She followed her gaze.
  The woman was about Kathryn's height; her hair was long and brilliantly black.
  The woman looked over and caught Kathryn's stare. She immediately grew a wide
  smile that exposed a set of pearly white teeth.</P>
<P>For some reason Alex felt a burning inside the
  pit of her stomach. She didn't like the look of admiration the woman returned
  to Kathryn. </P>
<P>"Hey Paul." Kathryn called to the copper colored
  woman. </P>
<P>"K." she joyously returned as she walked to
  the table. </P>
<P>K. What's up with that? Alex didn't like the
  nickname, I thought all her good friends called her Kat. She silently thought.
  </P>
<P>Kathryn got out of her seat and the two embraced
  like long lost friends. "How the hell have you been?" Kathryn asked still holding
  to the woman. </P>
<P>"Good, I haven't seen you around lately. So
  I guess you started school huh?" the woman said then smiled at Alex.</P>
<P>"Yea, just recently. Oh I'm so sorry this is
  Alex Trout, she's a um parent of one of my students." Kathryn sputtered out
  before she realized how that must have sounded to Alex.</P>
<P>A parent huh. "Hi how do you do" Alex smiled
  hiding the sting that just slapped at her.</P>
<P>"Alex this is Dr. Prescott&#133; Pauline."</P>
<P>"Hi, Paul. is fine." She said taking a step
  away from Kathryn. </P>
<P>Paul. OK. They must have gone to school together.
  "So same alma mater?" Alex curiously asked.</P>
<P>"No actually we met at an um&#133;UH&#133;Pauline
  started to say before she was nudged in the side with an elbow.</P>
<P>"Where just old friends." Kathryn cut her off.
  </P>
<P>"Yea, very good &#133; old &#133; friends."
  Pauline replied then winked at Kathryn. </P>
<P>Alex was amazed at the different shades of red
  that creeped over Kathryn's face and neck.</P>
<P>"I see." Was all she said.</P>
<P>The three women looked over to another person
  who called to Pauline. "Come over here sweetheart." Pauline replied in Spanish.
  </P>
<P>The younger woman walked over and stood at the
  side of the Ph.D. she was taller than Kat, do to her heels but not by much.
  Her hair was a long golden blonde and her eyes as green as Kathryn's. </P>
<P>"This is Maria, Pauline introduced.</P>
<P>Maria didn't speak English so the good doctor
  translated in Spanish. It just so happens that Alex understood what was said.
  Pauline told Maria that Kathryn was the one she used to date, but it was nothing
  serious. </P>
<P>Maria looked over Kathryn and raised an eyebrow.
  "Ella es muy bonita" Maria said.</P>
<P>"Yes she is." Alex interrupted in Spanish. </P>
<P>"Ah you speak Spanish?" Pauline Asked</P>
<P>"Yes, fluently. The corporation I used to work
  for had me stationed in Mexico for a year setting up new offices." Alex spoke
  so that both Pauline and Maria understood.</P>
<P>"So then you understood what I said, please
  forgive my stupidity, but it was for Maria's benefit." Pauline replied.</P>
<P>"It's OK, its good to see that your very open
  and honest about your relationship." Alex suggested admirably. </P>
<P>"Well it's the only way I know how to be." </P>
<P>"Hey, you two have me lost here." Kathryn said
  feeling like an outsider. </P>
<P>"Oh, sorry." Alex said returning to her native
  tongue. </P>
<P>"Well, our food is ready to go, so we'll be
  seen you." Pauline said as she reached out to hug Kathryn. She and Alex then
  exchanged handshakes. Maria just nodded her good-byes.</P>
<P>"Come on, let's get out of here." Alex said
  suddenly feeling a bit lighthearted at this new revelation.</P>
<P>The women decided to walk to the movie show
  since it was just a few blocks away.</P>
<P>"So how long did you date Pauline?" Alex asked
  rather nonchalantly. </P>
<P>"What?" Kathryn spit out although she heard
  exactly what Alex asked. </P>
<P>"Dated?"</P>
<P>"Um is that what you two were talking about?"
  Kathryn spoke angrily. </P>
<P>"Hey, I'm just curious, I figure I don't really
  have a chance anyway being a PARENT and all."</P>
<P>It took Kathryn a moment to digest what Alex
  just said. She stopped dead in her tracks and reached for Alex's shoulder. "I'm
  sorry about that, I didn't know how to introduce you."</P>
<P>"Well, a friend would have been a nice start."
  Alex spoke softly. </P>
<P>"Yea, I'm sorry, I really didn't want you to
  find out this way. I really like you so I figured I'd see, and if we became
  better friends I would have told you." She whispered the last part.</P>
<P>"Hey, it's alright. I was just asking. Don't
  worry, I like you too. I hope that we could be good friends. I haven't really
  had a good friend since before Sammy was born."</P>
<P>Kathryn grew a very large smile, "Really?" </P>
<P>"Yes, really." Alex said as she resumed her
  walking with Kathryn following behind.</P>
<P>"HEY." Kathryn called again coming to a stop.
  "What did you mean since you didn't have a chance anyway?"</P>
<P>Alex looked back, she had a grin on her face
  as she raised one of her eyebrows questioningly. Her eyes moved down then back
  up the length of Kathryn's body as if she were devouring every bit to memory.
  She turned and continued to walk without saying a word. </P>
<P>Kathryn stood there for a moment taking in what
  was not said. She swallowed hard.</P>
<P>"You coming?" Alex purred.</P>
<P>The younger woman jogged a few steps to catch
  up. She didn't say another word. </P>
<P>"So, whatcha want to see?" Alex asked looking
  up at the large menu display of movie titles.</P>
<P>"I don't know nothing scary though." Kathryn
  said. </P>
<P>The two women walked into the smaller theater
  and sat, placing the popcorn in between them. Alex liked Angelica Houston and
  suggested 'Agnes Browne.' Kathryn didn't mind since she had seen most of the
  movies that were showing there anyway.</P>
<P>In the midst of the movie two sets of hands
  kept brushing with electrical touches across one another while mingling in an
  array of salts, butter and popped&#133;corn.</P>
<P>Alex found her hand lingering a bit longer in
  the tub of popped corn awaiting the feathery touch of Kathryn's fingertips.
  She smiled as the young teacher would reach in and purposely, gently brush by
  Alex' hand then look up and grin.</P>
<P>Damn, she is just too cute. Alex thought. Well,
  now I know she's gay, so how do I tell her about me? Should I tell her everything?
  What about Sammy, it might make her feel uncomfortable, but she really likes
  her, she's also her teacher&#133; oh boy.. Alex was looking up at the screen,
  but she wasn't watching the movie.</P>
<P>Kathryn looked over to her seated companion;
  she could feel her heart begin to quicken. How can I feel like this for someone
  I just met? She puzzled over this idea.</P>
<P>Alex felt Kathryn's gaze and looked over to
  see a smile ever so subtle, yet filled with affection. She realized she wanted
  to kiss those lips and run her fingers softly through the short golden locks.
  She quickly turned her head and tried desperately to focus on the movie. </P>
<P>The night was cool and breezy, there was an
  air of activity throughout the Marketplace as the two friends walked back to
  the vehicle. Kathryn found she was still clutching the tissue that absorbed
  the seemingly endless amount of tears that ran down her face.</P>
<P>"You OK?" Alex found she was sorry for picking
  such a mushy ol' movie. </P>
<P>"Oh, yea, I always get like this with these
  kinds of movies." Kathryn said between blowing her nose. "I'm such a baby, but
  I can't help it." </P>
<P>Alex found that she liked this side of Kathryn.
  She had always thought it was silly of people to cry at movies, they are just
  movies. Nevertheless, seeing Kathryn react as she did touched some where deep
  inside of Alex. In between her heartbeats she felt a flutter. "Hmm" she sighed.
  </P>
<P>The drive home was quiet but not awkward. Alex
  had the radio playing softly in the background and she was humming to the music.
  Kathryn felt a peaceful comfort, she relaxed into the seat and closed her eyes.
  </P>
<P>Alex drove up to the driveway. "Here we are."
  </P>
<P>Kathryn opened her eyes and breathed in deeply.
  "So, what are you going to do tomorrow?"</P>
<P>Alex put the car in park but left the engine
  running. "I don't really have anything to do. My mom and Sammy were going to
  go to the zoo." </P>
<P>"You're not going to go with them?" Kathryn
  asked taking off her seatbelt and turning to the side to face Alex.</P>
<P>Alex noticed Kathryn getting comfortable in
  the car which made her smile. She turned off the engine and released her seatbelt.
  "I hadn't really thought about it. Usually my mom takes Sammy and they make
  plans to do things. I try and get some work done while they're gone." She readjusted
  herself so the side of her head could rest against the seat. "I was actually
  able to get a lot of work done this week while Sammy was in school." </P>
<P>The mention of school brought Kathryn back to
  the realization that Alex was her student's parent. She tried to shake the idea
  of leaning over and kissing Alex. However, those blue eyes were so inviting.
  She found herself leaning closer to the dark haired driver. Oh God, what am
  I doing? Kathryn jolted backward.</P>
<P>Alex felt her pulse quicken as Kathryn came
  closer, she wanted her too. She felt Kathryn jolt as she backed off. Her heart
  was still racing. She's having second thoughts. Ok just be honest with her.
  </P>
<P>"Um&#133; Kathryn?"</P>
<P>Kathryn sat staring out the window looking beyond
  the garage door into a voided space. "Yea" she spoke with melancholy. </P>
<P>"Can I be honest with you?" Alex whispered.
  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh boy, here it comes, Kathryn felt her stomach
  knot up. "Sure," she spoke with a deep sigh.</P>
<P>"Ok," Alex breathed, "I-um, I really like you
  and I want to be friends with you&#133;" Alex paused.</P>
<P>"But it's a problem because I'm gay and I'm
  your daughter's teacher," Kathryn interjected hastily.</P>
<P>"What&#133; no, it's not a problem," Alex spoke
  confusingly. She thinks it's a problem. Alex saw the worried look on Kathryn's
  face. "No, I like you, I did from the first time I saw you&#133; and I um, well,
  I really want to get to know you better." Alex let out the rest of her breath.
  </P>
<P>"You do," now it was Kathryn who looked confused.
  </P>
<P>"Is that so hard to believe." Alex spoke with
  credence. </P>
<P>"Well, kinda, yea&#133; I expected you to well,
  you know." Kathryn laughed out nervously.</P>
<P>"What, kick you out of my car and not speak
  to you again?" </P>
<P>"No, I don't think you'd do that, but, it's
  just that only my close friends know who I really am. Because of my job, it's
  not something I talk about. Not that I'm ashamed of who I am, but it's just&#133;
  well, with work." Kathryn felt herself mumbling.</P>
<P>"It's OK, I can understand how hard it must
  be for you, especially being a teacher. You'd sure cause a commotion. Probably
  end up on the eight O'clock news." Alex shook her head trying to imagine the
  headlines. </P>
<P>"Yea, I remember a story about a math teacher
  who was fired by the school board."</P>
<P>"For being gay, they can't do that." Alex felt
  an anger growing inside her, but she knew all to well the realities of society.
  </P>
<P>"No, they can't, but they can get you on other
  things." Kathryn thought about being in that position. "It's frustrating, how
  the board and parents want teachers to be the perfect person around their children.
  They expect us to be non human I guess, have no life after school hours." </P>
<P>Alex let out a snort. "Yea I guess parents do
  expect you to be straight laced and one-hundred percent teacher all the time.
  It must be hard?" </P>
<P>"Not really for me, though, I've never really
  had much of a relationship with anyone, so I didn't have to hide anything."
  </P>
<P>"What about Pauline?" Alex asked with a bit
  of surprise. </P>
<P>"Well to tell the truth, I met her a few summers
  ago at a bar called Peaches." </P>
<P>"I know Peaches," Alex interrupted rather hastily.
  </P>
<P>"You do?" Kathryn said as her eyebrows narrowed
  in a questioning manner. </P>
<P>"Well, I haven't been there for a long while,
  I used to&#133; you know before Sammy was born."</P>
<P>Now Kathryn really looked confused.</P>
<P>"Kathryn!" Alex interjected "I'm gay too. Hello,
  didn't you feel my responding to your little um," she cleared her throat, "unintentional
  brushes, I thought I was a bit obvious there didn't you?" </P>
<P>"I was getting mixed feeling. I didn't want
  to let my self, you know...ya know!" Kathryn spoke while rolling her eyes. "But
  what about Sammy her father...I mean, I hope I'm not prying?" </P>
<P>"No you're not prying. I used to work for a
  corporation down town. I was one of three Associate Directors, and I was up
  for VP, it was between me and another guy. Anyway we had this account we were
  bidding for and the one who landed it would most likely be promoted. The owner
  of the company we were bidding on, for what ever the reason had taken an interest
  in me." Alex paused.</P>
<P>"For what ever the reason?" Kathryn interrupted,
  "Alex come on, I mean look at you, you're beautiful."</P>
<P>Alex smiled and softly said thanks. "Anyway,
  I took advantage of this opportunity, it was stupid, the only reason I even
  considered sleeping with this guy was to get that damned promotion." </P>
<P>"You didn't use protection?" Kathryn sounded
  worried as her eyes widened. </P>
<P>"Yea I did, I made him, but somehow I guess
  it broke and&#133; well two months later I found out I was pregnant."</P>
<P>"Oh Alex."</P>
<P>"No, it was a good thing. I would have never
  even thought of having a baby, especially since I had no desires to be with
  a man. But honestly I was glad, I was amazed, and it was wonderful being pregnant.
  It just felt right." </P>
<P>"Really?" Kathryn now sounded excited.</P>
<P>"Yea, I wouldn't change anything that happened.
  What really pissed me off though was that I landed that account and still was
  passed over. So I decided to quit and find something I could do without interrupting
  Sam's routine. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I really believe
  that it was meant to be this way." Alex had a glow of pure love for her daughter
  as she spoke about her.</P>
<P>"What about Sam's father, what happened to him?"
  </P>
<P>"I didn't want to tell him at first, but my
  mom kept insisting that he had a right to know his child, so we got together
  for lunch one day and he was surprised to see me pregnant. I told him it was
  his. He turned so pale, I though he was going to pass out right there. Then
  he told me he couldn't have anything to do with me or the child because he was
  married and his wife was the actual owner of the business, if she ever found
  out about this it would ruin him. I was relieved and decided that I could live
  with that. When Sammy turned a year old, I received a bunch of money orders
  with Sam's name on them. She gets them every year now. No return address or
  name, or note of any kind, which is fine with me. I figure when Sam's old enough
  if she wants to know, then I'll tell her."</P>
<P>"Wow, at least he sends money, I know a lot
  of guys who wouldn't." Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Yea, I was a bit surprised myself, maybe because
  he didn't have any kids with his wife."</P>
<P>"Really."</P>
<P>"Ah, yea really" Alex laughed looking at Kathryn's
  concerned expression. "Hey! How did we end up talking about me?" </P>
<P>"I don't know, but I'm glad you told me. Do
  you think there'll come a time when he'd want to see her?"</P>
<P>Alex thought about that, "only time will tell...
  I don't know" Kathryn smiled as she leaned a bit closer to Alex. </P>
<P>"Well you know, I've never really talked about
  this before with anyone other than my mother. But you, you somehow make me feel&#133;I
  don't know, just comfortable I guess." Alex slid down a little in the seat so
  that now she and Kathryn were almost touching.</P>
<P>Both women sat relaxed in the car like they
  were at a drive-in movie. Neither one said a word. The garage door was a blank
  screen for which both had settled in to watch.</P>
<P>"Alex?" Kathryn turned her head slightly to
  see the dark-haired woman's profile.</P>
<P>"Hmm."</P>
<P>"Would you like to kiss me?"</P>
<P>Alex turned to meet green eyes filled with a
  deepening desire. She breathed in a hesitant amount of air, released it then
  tilted her head a bit and ever-so-slowly brought her lips down on Kathryn's.
  </P>
<P>Kathryn breathed in with her nose as she tasted
  the warm, moist juices of saliva that penetrated her own damp lips. She opened
  her mouth acceptingly as Alex moved her tongue in to begin the dance of the
  lingua. In unison they danced as a heat began to rise, moisture and friction
  caused sparks to ignite a flame of passion that would become impossible to put
  out. </P>
<P>Slowly the dancers began to pull away, hearts
  racing, breaths heaving, organs of taste pulsating, wanting, and needing. </P>
<P>Kathryn was lost, her head was spinning, and
  her brain was not working. Slowly she began to come back to her senses. She
  opened her eyes to see Alex in a similar state. "Wow!" she swallowed hard, "Alex,
  I've never felt anything so intense before. I mean I've heard people say that
  one kiss could knock you off you feet, but I would'a never believed it&#133;"
  Kathryn was mumbling.</P>
<P>Alex opened her eyes, "Whered'ya learn to kiss
  like that? Come here." Alex leaned over and started another dance, not waiting
  for an answer. </P>
<P>Kathryn was more than happy to oblige.</P>
<P>What seemed like minutes turned quickly into
  a few hours as these two newfound companions did what others were doing all
  over this inhabited planet. But the question was, how far would they go? </P>
<P>"God I feel like I'm in high school making out
  with the head cheerleader." Alex said after her lips pulled away from Kathryn's.
  </P>
<P>"You were with the head cheerleader?"</P>
<P>"No, I wanted to be, but she liked the quarterback
  and I couldn't well be him." Alex chuckled. "So I settled for the drill team
  leader." </P>
<P>"Well I had a thing for my English teacher.
  She was tall, dark and very beautiful." Kathryn spoke realizing that Alex had
  similar features save for the blue eyes. Mrs. Bernard had light brown eyes.
  </P>
<P>"So did anything happen?" Alex asked as she
  raised her eyebrows up and down. </P>
<P>"Yea, Mrs. Bernard had twins."</P>
<P>Alex began to laugh. Kathryn joined in and soon
  both were uncontrollably holding each other's sides.</P>
<P>As the laughter subsided, Kathryn stifled a
  yawn. She leaned her head into Alex's shoulder and let out a long sigh. </P>
<P>"So&#133;you wanna come in?"</P>
<P>Alex raised one eye brow in contemplation. "I
  don't know if that would be a good idea, I mean, well, do you want me to come
  in?" she spoke with hesitation. "Maybe we should take it slowly?" she answered
  before Kathryn could say anything.</P>
<P>"Well, if that's what you really want to do,
  but, I figured we could just talk a little while longer and maybe have some
  coffee. It's still early." Kathryn's voice seeped with disappointment as she
  looked at her watch it read ten-thirty.</P>
<P>"Yea, what am I saying. I guess I'm used to
  going to bed early because of Sam. Beside, she's spending the night with grandma.
  So why do I feel like I have a curfew or something? Yea, let's have some coffee."
  </P>
<P>Kathryn stared at Alex letting her finish her
  own debate before she got out of the car. Both women went inside and Alex settled
  down on the sofa in the living room. Kathryn went into the kitchen to put on
  a pot of coffee.</P>
