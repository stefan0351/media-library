<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 42: New Hope -->

<p>Rebecca stepped down from the stagecoach and groaned as her
		cramped muscles protested the long hours of inactivity that had brought her to New Hope,
		Oklahoma. She had taken a train from Tahlequah to Tulsa where she spent the night in the
		train depot. Early the following morning she caught the stagecoach, which, after a few
		other stops, would have her in New Hope by late that afternoon. At least for the last
		couple of hours she had had the coach to herself and was able to stretch out and take a
		bit of a nap. But even so, her eyes felt gritty and she knew she must look a fright. As
		soon as the driver handed her bag down from the top of the coach she made her way to the
		saloon. A sign in the window boasted rooms to rent, bath included. A bath might make her
		feel human again. The dedication of the new city hall, whose clock tower was visible from
		where she stood, was to take place the following day. She didn?t know if the governor
		was in town already and would not be able to recognize him even if he were, so she planned
		to approach him immediately after the dedication. There was nothing for her to do until
		then, so she decided a bath and a good nights sleep would be the best thing in the world
		next to freeing Josie.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>There was a festival attitude in the air the next morning when
		Rebecca made her way toward the new City Hall. Flags and streamers of colorful paper
		garlanded every building on Main Street leading up to the impressive new building. It was
		still several hours until the official dedication, and she decided to stop and get
		something to eat to stop the rumbling in her stomach. The smells from the café drew her
		across the street a block away from the City Hall. There was not an empty table to be had,
		but as she searched the room she saw a table for two with a lone occupant. It was a
		well-dressed woman perhaps 10 years older than she was, and she was engrossed in reading a
		newspaper. Rebecca wound through the tables until she was standing near the woman?s
		shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me, I wonder if you would mind letting me share your
		table? There doesn?t seem to be another empty seat in the place." The woman
		looked up and smiled, and Rebecca found herself smiling back. The woman?s eyes were
		as green as springtime grass with laugh lines creasing the corners. She had dimples that
		crinkled when she smiled and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks.</p>

		<p>"Please do. My husband has eaten and gone off to get ready
		for the ceremony, and I?d be glad for the company."</p>

		<p>"Thank you," Rebecca said, dropping her bag on the
		floor and sliding it under the table. She held out her hand to shake the other
		woman?s hand as she sat down. "I?m Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Eugenia," the other woman said. She looked around
		until she spotted the waitress, and motioned for her to come over. "Would you clear
		away these plates please and bring a menu for Rebecca. Oh, and a little more coffee for
		me, please."</p>

		<p>"Oh, me too. Coffee. Please." The waitress smiled and
		returned a moment later with a menu, a cup and a pot of coffee. Rebecca wrapped her hands
		around the steaming mug to warm them up and regarded her companion in silence for a
		moment. Something about her struck a familiar chord, yet she was almost certain they had
		never met. "This place is certainly doing a brisk business for this hour of the day.
		Is it always like this?"</p>

		<p>"I wouldn?t know. I?ve never been here before;
		we?re in town for the dedication. Is that what brought you here?" Eugenia poured
		some milk into her coffee and stirred in a spoonful of sugar then sipped the steaming
		brew.</p>

		<p>"No. Well, yes sort of. Actually I came to talk to the
		governor, but since he is here for the dedication I guess you could say that?s why
		I?m here too. I don?t suppose you know what he looks like? I?d like to talk
		to him before the ceremony, if I can."</p>

		<p>Eugenia laughed and the sound reminded Rebecca of the ringing of
		a bright clear bell. "I guess I know what he looks like. He?s my husband."
		Rebecca nearly spilled her coffee as she banged her cup on the table.</p>

		<p>"You?re joking."</p>

		<p>"There have been times when I thought our marriage was a
		joke, but?" Her voice trailed off, and after a moment she smiled again at
		Rebecca and asked, "What business do you have with my husband, if you don?t mind
		my asking?" Rebecca decided to tell the entire story to Eugenia and see if she could
		get her to speak to her husband for her. What incredible luck to find herself with just
		the person she needed to arrange an introduction to the governor!</p>

		<p>"My?" She stopped a second to contemplate how to
		refer to Josie. Friend just didn?t cover it any more. "My partner is in jail.
		She?s supposed to go before the circuit judge next week, and he?s going to
		decide whether to send her back to the states to stand trial for train robbery, among
		other things. But she didn?t do all those crimes, and she never killed anybody that
		didn?t need killing. And she gave the money back to the Cherokee?s,
		and?" Eugenia?s face drained of color and her eyes widened as she listened
		to the young woman plead for her partner. The moment she heard the word
		"Cherokee?s" the face across from her at the table faded away, and she was
		back in a barn beside her best friend as bullets flew through the air around them.</p>

		<p>"Eugenia, are you all right?" Rebecca?s voice
		pierced through her trance and brought her back to the moment. The young woman was holding
		her hand and lightly rubbing her wrist. "You looked like you might faint there for a
		moment."</p>

		<p>"No, I?m all right. Rebecca, your?partner,
		what?s her name?"</p>

		<p>"Josie Hunter." Eugenia leaned back in her chair and
		closed her eyes. She gasped in a few shallow breaths and then expelled them before she
		opened her eyes to once again regard her young companion.</p>

		<p>"You know her." It wasn?t a question. Eugenia
		nodded.</p>

		<p>Josie had never mentioned a Eugenia from her past, but then she
		was pretty closed mouthed about the life she led before they met. Suddenly she knew what
		was familiar about this woman ? Josie had described her so perfectly. She was the one
		with the dancing green eyes and the infectious smile that had captured the heart of a
		teen-aged Josie. Even as the thought was forming in Rebecca?s head she realized the
		impossibility of it, but the words tumbled out of her mouth. "You?re
		Genie," she said simply.</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>She stared at Genie, her thoughts miles ahead of her ability to
		put words together rationally. Finally she managed to stammer, "But how?they
		told her you were dead."</p>

		<p>A small sob escaped from Genie?s mouth before she could stop
		herself, and a tear coursed down her cheek. "They told me she was dead, too, but not
		until months after I had recovered from the gun shot wound. So that?s why she?I
		never understood why she didn?t make an effort to contact me." She scrubbed the
		tear off her face with the napkin she was holding and her fingers continued to twist the
		fabric until it was in a tight knot in her hand. She seemed not to notice even as her
		hands turned white from the effort, and it was not until Rebecca reached across and
		lightly touched her hand that she realized what she was doing. She smiled at Rebecca and
		continued. "I told my father what had really happened that night, and he told me she
		had run away. I think he was afraid I would have a relapse if he told me the truth then,
		and later?well later he just didn?t want me to know what a coward he was, I
		think. Anyway, I made sure her name was cleared, and they arrested the men who were
		actually responsible for the thefts. I was sure she would read about it in the papers and
		come back. One of the ranch hands finally told me that they - my father ? had hung
		Josie."</p>

		<p>Tears ran down her face again as she relieved the horror of the
		night she learned the truth. She had been so blinded by anger that she had taken a gun
		from her fathers collection, stormed into the barn where he was working, pointed it at his
		head and pulled the trigger. There was a hollow click as the hammer fell on an empty
		chamber. Before she could try to fire again the gun was wrenched from her hand by one of
		the men working with her father. Without a word of explanation she had turned and run from
		the barn, going straight to her room to pack up her clothes. She refused to speak to her
		father when he pounded on her door. He pled with her to tell him what was wrong, but she
		said nothing until she had her suitcases in hand and was ready to leave. She opened the
		door to see his shocked face as his eyes took in her obvious preparation for leaving.</p>

		<p>"I know what you did," she hissed through clenched
		teeth.</p>

		<p>"Genie, I?"</p>

		<p>"Don?t bother to try to deny it! You had to know she
		was trying to help me catch the rustlers. She was my best friend in the world?she
		would never have done anything to hurt me. And she was not a thief! You killed her because
		she was an Indian. She was the most decent person I ever knew. I have half a mind to tell
		the sheriff?"</p>

		<p>"Now don?t be hasty, honey, let me ex?" She
		cut him off and shouldered past him.</p>

		<p>"I?m leaving. I?m going to stay with Aunt Stell
		until fall and then you are going to pay for me to go to school back east. And if I never
		see you again that?ll be far too soon for me."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Genie took another sip of her now cold coffee. She pushed the cup
		aside and took a deep breath and continued. "I met William while I was at Vassar. He
		was a bright young man with a lot of ambition and I knew he was going to be a success.
		There was never any?great romance between us but he loved me and was at least willing
		to marry me without a dowry, which I refused to ask my father for. It was after we married
		that I read about Josie being arrested for robbing a train. I told William I was going to
		visit a sick cousin in Pennsylvania but I actually went to try to see Josie in jail. By
		the time I got there she had escaped, and I was never able to track her down. I always
		thought?if I could find her and tell her she wasn?t wanted for the rustling at
		my father?s ranch that I might be able to turn her away from the path she had chosen.
		I blamed myself for her turning to a life of crime. If I hadn?t talked her into
		trying to fight a bunch of murdering outlaws?"</p>

		<p>"Don?t blame yourself, Genie. She went after the
		railroads because of what they did to her father and her father?s people, not because
		of what happened to you. There would have been nothing you could do about it."</p>

		<p>"I could have talked her out of it. She listened to me; she
		believed in me."</p>

		<p>"She loved you." Rebecca?s heart lurched in her
		chest as she spoke those words. For the first time it truly sunk in that the woman across
		from her was Josie?s first true love. The jealousy she had successfully conquered
		when she believed Genie to be dead reappeared and caught her off guard. She had to force
		herself not to bite off her next words. "She never stopped loving you."</p>

		<p>Genie?s expression changed from one of sorrow for the past
		she could no longer effect to determination for the future, which she could. She
		didn?t notice the bitterness in Rebecca?s voice, or if she did she gave no sign
		of it. "She?s still the best friend I?ve ever had," Genie said
		sincerely, "and I promise I will help you convince my husband not to let them send
		her back to the states." The clock in the new City Hall pealed the hour of eleven
		o?clock. The ceremony was due to start at noon exactly. "We have an hour for you
		to fill me in on the current situation, and as soon as William is finished with his speech
		I?ll introduce you to him." She reached over and patted Rebecca on the hand and
		smiled. "Don?t worry, Rebecca. I won?t let her down this time."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca and Genie separated a half-hour later so that Genie could
		freshen up before taking her seat on the platform with her husband. Rebecca went to the
		telegraph office to send a wire to John and let him know she had succeeded in her mission.
		The fact that she had not yet spoken to the governor himself did not worry her. She had no
		doubt that Genie could talk him into pardoning Josie if she had him wrapped half as
		tightly around her finger as she once had Josie.</p>

		<p>She waited in the telegraph office for a reply to her telegram,
		which read:</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <blockquote>
			<p>JOHN: FOUND THE GOVERNOR STOP TELL JOSIE NOT TO WORRY STOP BACK
			IN THREE DAYS STOP ANY PROBLEMS? STOP WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY STOP SIGNED: REBECCA CAMERON</p>
		  </blockquote>
		</blockquote>

		<p>The clock had struck twelve and Rebecca was about to walk out the
		door when the machine began to clatter and the clerk called out to her to stop. Excited,
		she rushed back to the desk while the rest of the message was received, and the clerk
		handed her a piece of paper.</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <blockquote>
			<p>REBECCA: JUDGE IS EARLY STOP THREE DAYS MAY BE TOO LATE STOP HAVE
			GOVERNOR SEND WIRE TO JUDGE STOP URGENT STOP SIGNED: JOHN KENWOOD</p>
		  </blockquote>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Rebecca had to read the message twice before the meaning truly
		sunk in. The paper fluttered from her fingers as she raced out the door and toward her now
		more important than ever meeting with the governor.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The morning sun streaming through the bars of her cell wakened
		Josie. As she swung her legs over the edge of the bed her eyes lit on the scraps of paper
		she had thrown on the floor the night before. One was a wire addressed to the Sheriff from
		Judge Fellowes saying that his schedule had changed and that he would be stopping in
		Tahlequah possibly as early as the next day. The other was from Rebecca saying that she
		had found the governor and Josie was not to worry. John had promised he would do what he
		could to delay the proceedings long enough for Rebecca to return with something written in
		the governor?s own hand saying that Josie was not to be extradited. Or even better,
		if the governor himself would come. She paused in her ruminations and chided herself.
		According to John, Judge Fellowes was known to be one of the most mule-headed men he knew,
		and it was not likely he would accept anything less than the governor face to face before
		he would admit that his authority could be over-ridden. And that he would swiftly decide
		in favor of her return to the states and make arrangements for her transportation was a
		foregone conclusion in John?s opinion.</p>

		<p>The sound of the door leading to the cells opening and slamming
		shut resounded through the small area in which she was confined, and was followed by
		footsteps coming down the hall. She had to smile; the Sheriff invariably made a good deal
		of noise before entering the room to allow his prisoner time to "get decent" in
		case she was using the chamber pot.</p>

		<p>"You awake, Miss Josie?" He called before he actually
		came into view.</p>

		<p>"Yes," she grumbled. "Me and everybody within a
		mile of this place, with all the noise you?re making."</p>

		<p>"Sorry," he mumbled, "but I figured you?d
		want to see this." He stood in front of her door with another wire held in his hand.
		By the look on his face she could tell the news was not good. She took the paper from his
		hand and glanced at it, then dropped it to the floor with the rest. The judge was arriving
		that afternoon, and wanted to get the hearing under way immediately.</p>

		<p>"Nothing from Rebecca or the governor?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "No, but I did find out that the school
		is staging a pageant this afternoon. Since we use the schoolhouse as a courthouse it
		won?t be possible to have a hearing there. That buys us one more day anyway."</p>

		<p>"It?s just postponing the inevitable, John.
		Tomorrow?s Saturday, which means no school, and no conflict with the hearing. Rebecca
		won?t be here before Sunday, and by then I?ll be on a train heading east."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca gazed out the window of the stagecoach where a dust devil
		gathered a collection of leaves and pieces of tumbleweeds only to scatter them again and
		move on. Since Josie had been jailed, she felt as scattered as those tumbleweeds. She
		lowered the flap once again and settled back on her seat. Across from her Genie sat with
		her head resting against the side of the coach, her eyes closed. Up until a short while
		before she had been knitting while the two women sat in silence but the rocking motion of
		the coach had apparently lulled her to sleep. Rebecca took the opportunity to study Genie
		as she slept. It was easy to see why Josie had fallen for her. If anything, she was
		prettier than Josie had described. Rebecca?s emotions warred within her. She knew
		that Josie would be pleased beyond words to find that her friend had survived, and she
		would not begrudge her that happiness. But at the same time she could not help fearing
		that Josie might prefer this mature sophisticated woman who once meant everything to her.
		She felt like a country bumpkin compared to Genie, and she wanted to hate her. But when
		the coach hit a rough patch of road and Genie woke up and flashed those dimples at her,
		she couldn?t help but like her. She smiled back.</p>

		<p>"Penny for your thoughts," Genie said as she resumed
		her knitting. So skilled was she that her eyes never left Rebecca?s face, yet her
		fingers flew as she worked, never dropping a stitch. Genie could tell that something was
		bothering the younger woman more than Josie?s current plight, and from the occasional
		looks she saw on her face, she surmised that it had something to do with herself. She
		wished there was something she could say or do that would allay her fears, but she did not
		want to assume anything until Rebecca confirmed her suspicions.</p>

		<p>"Wouldn?t be money very well spent, I?m afraid. My
		thoughts are kind of?muddled right now."</p>

		<p>"Can I help?" The look of concern on her face and the
		sincerity in her voice brought tears to Rebecca?s eyes. Genie set aside her knitting
		and moved from her side of the coach to sit beside Rebecca, grateful that her husband had
		been able to arrange for a private coach to transport them to the train depot. She put her
		arm around Rebecca?s shoulders and gently pulled the young woman?s head down to
		rest on her shoulder. The act of kindness only seemed to make Rebecca cry harder, and she
		began to sob outright. Genie stroked her cheek with her free hand and lightly kissed her
		hair as she murmured softly, "Shhh, its going to be all right. Everything will be
		fine. We?ll get there in time; don?t worry." She continued to stroke
		Rebecca?s face and hold her until the sobbing stopped and Rebecca pulled away.</p>

		<p>"I-I don?t know what I?d do if I?lost
		her."</p>

		<p>"She?s not going anywhere Rebecca. William will be
		there as soon as he finishes his business, and he promised he wouldn?t let them
		extradite her before he has a chance to hear her case himself."</p>

		<p>"That?s not?the only way to lose her,"
		Rebecca said so softly Genie almost didn?t hear her.</p>

		<p>"You love her very much, don?t you?" Rebecca
		nodded, unable to trust herself to speak without bursting into tears again. Genie took
		Rebecca?s hand in both of hers lightly caressing it as she spoke. "I love her
		too, Rebecca. She was the first person to ever make me believe that I could be and do
		anything I wanted to be. Remembering her strength was what allowed me to pack up and leave
		my father; I knew Josie would have wanted me to stand up for myself, and I did. Any time I
		found myself in a tough spot in my life I asked myself, what would Josie do in this
		situation? And I think I made some very good choices. Marrying William was one choice I
		was not so certain about when I did it. In my heart I was grieving for Josie, and I almost
		felt I was being unfaithful without even truly recognizing the feeling for what it was.
		But as the years went by I grew to love him, even more so after our children were born.
		He?s such a kind and gentle father. The girls adore him, and so do I. I am where I
		belong, Rebecca. I will always love Josie, but not the way you do. And if she loves you
		half as much as I can tell you love her, I?d say the two of you are where you belong
		also."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Genie?you?. I don?t know what to say.
		Thank you. I feel like such a baby, but I couldn?t...stop thinking about how she
		looked when she told me about you. She loved you more than anything else in the world. I
		got jealous just listening to her, and I didn?t even know you were alive. Then I meet
		you and find that you?re the perfect woman?"</p>

		<p>Genie threw back her head and laughed. She laughed so hard tears
		came to her eyes. "Perfect woman? Oh darlin? I am so far from perfect I
		can?t even see it from here. But thanks for the complement. And the laugh. Thought I
		was going to bust a gut." Genie?s laughter was infectious and Rebecca found
		herself joining in. Soon they both had tears of laughter streaming down their faces, and a
		bond of friendship had been welded that would last through their lifetimes.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie formed a mental picture of the judge as she listened to him
		sputter and argue with the sheriff in the outer office. She pegged him for one of those
		balding banty roosters with a beer belly and drooping mustaches. He was the type who would
		cross the street to avoid passing too close to an Indian, and when forced to deal with
		them as human beings he would look down his long pointy nose with an attitude of
		superiority. She had known dozens just like that in her lifetime; Genie?s father was
		a prime example of the breed. The shame of it was that these little petty tyrants
		frequently rose to positions of authority and power where they could impose their will
		over people whose only crime was that their skin was not white.</p>

		<p>"And I don?t know why you didn?t tell the teacher
		to cancel that damned recital when you knew I had to be out of town by Sunday," the
		judge thundered.</p>

		<p>"It?s not a recital. It?s the Autumn Festival, and
		the children have been looking forward to it since school started. Besides, the wire from
		the governor says we are not supposed to?"</p>

		<p>"To hell with that wire, man! For all I know it was sent by
		that half-breed?s friend." The wire from the governor had shown up no more than
		15 minutes before the judge himself. It said that no action was to be taken in the case of
		Josie Hunter, and that he would review it upon his arrival Sunday or Monday. The judge had
		planned to be on his way to his next appointment by Sunday, and the thought of being held
		up by that Indian loving pantywaist just stuck in his craw. He truly believed that the
		wire had indeed come from William Howe as the sheriff claimed, but he was not about to
		admit it. And since he had taken the wire from the sheriff, it was his word against that
		half-breed that there even was such a wire. With luck he could be gone before the governor
		arrived, after making sure that Josie Hunter was on board the same eastbound train.
		"You just have the schoolhouse ready for me by 9AM tomorrow, and the first case
		I?ll be hearing will be Josie Hunter."</p>

		<p>Josie heard the sound of the street door slamming followed by
		John?s footsteps approaching her cell. He didn?t even bother to make the noise
		he usually did to warn her of his approach; she couldn?t have missed the loud
		exchange between himself and the judge unless she was deaf as a post. He knew she would be
		expecting him. Sure enough she stood leaning against the bars, her face an unreadable
		mask.</p>

		<p>"You heard?" She nodded. "He?s a real prince
		of a fellow, no doubt about it."</p>

		<p>"I can tell. John, it doesn?t look much like the
		cavalry is going to come riding over the hill at the last moment, so I think we need to
		come up with some alternate plans." She paused and looked into his eyes for a moment
		and continued, "That is if you still want to keep me from getting my neck
		stretched."</p>

		<p>"As long as it?s within the law, I am up for
		anything," he responded emphatically.</p>

		<p>"Well then, let?s put our heads together and see if we
		can come up with something."</p>

		<p>In her dream she was standing in the pouring rain watching as a
		group of men constructed a gallows with which to hang her. She was not bound or restrained
		in any way, yet she knew that running would be pointless. On the top of the platform a
		stout balding man pulled a lever to release a trap door, and a large sack of grain dropped
		through the opening and swung from the end of the rope, creaking as it moved in the
		buffeting wind. The bald man turned and looked at her with a malevolent gleam in his eye
		and said, "We?re almost ready for you, half-breed." She hadn?t seen
		him in years, but there was no question as to who he was - Genie?s father.</p>

		<p>"I was only trying to help," she protested, knowing
		that he would not listen. He had never listened.</p>

		<p>The man took his eyes off her and glanced toward someone she
		could not make out in the heavy rain, and he beckoned to the person to come to the
		platform. "She?s going to swing for what she did to you," he said to the
		distant figure. "Come and watch." As the figure drew closer she could tell that
		it was a woman, but she wore a heavy cloak with a hood and her face was completely in
		shadow. Instead of approaching the platform, the woman turned and walked toward Josie, and
		the closer she got the more familiar she seemed. When she was almost within Josie?s
		reach she stopped and took the hood off her head. Light brown curls tumbled out from under
		the hood, and green eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled at the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Josie," the woman said softly as she reached out her
		hand.</p>

		<p>"Genie," she answered tremulously, reaching out her own
		hand, only to see the landscape and the beautiful vision within it dissolve into the dirty
		stone walls of her jail cell. The sound of rain persisted even as the dream faded and she
		realized that she had incorporated the actual rain into her dream, even as she had
		conjured Genie from her past. But the voice had seemed so real, and she couldn?t
		shake the feeling that if she had been able to hold on to the dream for a few seconds more
		she would have been able to touch her?</p>

		<p>"I?m here, Josie."</p>

		<p>Josie twisted frantically around on her cot and saw the woman
		standing outside the bars of her cell. She wore a hooded cape much as the vision from her
		dream had worn and her face was obscured, but there was no mistaking that lilting voice.
		But of course that was impossible. Certainly she must still be asleep, even though she
		could swear she was wide awake. She swung her legs off the cot and stood up, taking the
		few steps required to bring her close to the bars and the specter that waited for her on
		the other side of them. She was in no hurry to wake up from this dream.</p>

		<p>"I didn?t have any dinner, so you couldn?t
		possibly be a bit of undigested beef."</p>

		<p>Genie laughed and pulled the hood from her head. " ?A
		Christmas Carol?, she said as she removed the cape and draped it over her arm.
		"We took turns reading aloud from that book, remember? Your English accent was
		terrible."</p>

		<p>"And yours was?" Josie?s voice trailed off
		and her eyes widened. She studied the face of the woman before her, and it was Genie as
		she would have looked today if she had lived. "You?you?re?I?m not
		dreaming, am I?"</p>

		<p>"No," she said with a shake of her head, her face
		wreathed in a smile.</p>

		<p>"Genie!" Josie cried, reaching through the bars to
		grasp Genie?s shoulders. She pulled her as close as she could with the iron in the
		way, and when she realized she was probably crushing her she let go of her shoulders and
		placed her hands on either side of her face. Without even thinking she brought her lips to
		Genie?s and kissed her softly. "Oh, Genie I missed you so much." Tears
		welled up in her eyes and ran unchecked down her cheeks. Genie produced a handkerchief
		from her pocketbook and gently wiped the tears away.</p>

		<p>"I wanted to die when they told me you were dead. I almost
		gave up the struggle when I was dangling from that rope, but I knew you would want me to
		live, so I fought to free myself. I can?t believe you?re really here. And
		now? how did you?find me?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched the reunion of the two friends from the doorway
		leading into the cell area. She wanted to give them some time alone, even though she ached
		to take Josie in her arms and make her forget that there was anyone else in the world but
		themselves. Watching Josie kiss Genie was one of the hardest things she had ever done, but
		she reminded herself of what Genie had said and forced a smile to her face as she walked
		into the room.</p>

		<p>"I found her. Josie, meet Mrs. William Howe, wife of the
		governor of the Territory of Oklahoma."</p>

		<p>Josie turned toward the source of the voice she knew so well and
		her smile left no doubt in Rebecca?s mind that even though she may love Genie, her
		heart was committed only to herself. Josie reached through the bars and said in a husky
		voice, "Come here."</p>

		<p>Rebecca grasped Josie?s fingers and the outlaw pulled her
		toward the bars. When her face was within reach, Josie put her hand behind Rebecca?s
		head and pulled her in for a kiss. The kiss she gave Rebecca made the one she gave Genie
		seem like the kind one might give to a visiting elderly aunt. After several moments, Genie
		cleared her throat and the lovers reluctantly separated.</p>

		<p>"I hate to?interrupt, but 9 o?clock isn?t
		that far away, and I think we need to discuss our strategy."</p>

		<p>"The hell with that," Josie replied. "I want to
		hear all about you." She raised her voice and called to the outer office, "John,
		how about some chairs for my guests? We should get comfortable, ladies. It?s going to
		be a long night."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The judge was working on his third whiskey and was just about to
		call it a night when the farmer approached his table. The man looked to have had more than
		his share of liquor, and the judge was about to brush him off as a drunken bar fly when
		the man spoke.</p>

		<p>"S?cuse me, sir. Th? bartender tole me you?re
		the judge that?s gonna be decidin? whether to send Josie Hunter back to the
		states. Izzat true?"</p>

		<p>"True enough," the judge allowed. No point in
		mentioning that the governor had effectively taken the decision out of his hands. If he
		could get that half-breed out of town before the governor arrived he would deal with the
		consequences of his actions later. "What?s your interest in the matter?"</p>

		<p>Without waiting for an invitation, Caleb pulled out a chair and
		sat down across from the judge. "Well, sir, my daughter has fallen under the spell of
		that she-devil, and I reckon the only way to get her away from her is to make sure that
		bitch is locked up good and tight. Until they hang her, that is. And I?m the one told
		the sheriff she was coming to town and got him to arrest her, so I reckon the reward is
		mine." He held out his hand, which the judge grasped reluctantly; the man didn?t
		look as if he had bathed in months. "Name?s Caleb Cameron."</p>

		<p>"Sounds as if you and I have a common goal, Mr. Cameron. I
		have no use for Indians, even the so-called "peaceful" ones. And this one is
		anything but peaceful." The judge twisted the strands of his long moustache as he
		contemplated how he might use this man to his advantage. "Suppose your daughter is
		the one Josie sent off to find the governor and try to get him to over-ride my decision.
		If she shows up in town before I get a chance to rule, I think we need to get her out of
		the picture."</p>

		<p>"No problem. As long as I know I don?t have to stick
		around here to get my reward, I?ll just grab the girl and head on home."</p>

		<p>"You do that, Mr. Cameron. Leave Josie Hunter to me."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>When Rebecca woke to find her body spooned around a soft female
		form she instinctively cuddled closer, wrapping her arm tightly around her partners waist
		and pulling her toward her. Her nose was buried in the fragrant curls of her hair?and
		her eyes flew open when she realized the smell was not Josie, but Genie. When they had
		left the jail in the wee hours of the morning there was only one room available in the
		tavern, so they had to share. Hoping that the other woman still slept, she gently eased
		her body to the side of the bed and dropped her feet to the floor. She dressed as
		noiselessly as possible and after leaving a note to let Genie know she had left for the
		jail already, she let herself out of the room.</p>

		<p>John was speaking to two men in a language Rebecca could not
		understand when she walked into his office. By the look of their clothes and the language,
		Rebecca assumed they were Cherokee. She smiled in greeting to them and then sat to wait
		for John to finish so he could unlock the door to the cells.</p>

		<p>"Help yourself to coffee, Miss Rebecca," John said with
		a nod toward the pot on top of the iron stove. "I?ll only be a few
		minutes." Gratefully Rebecca poured herself a cup, which she held in her hands to
		keep the morning chill away. The rain had finally let up some time during the night, but
		the temperature was unseasonably cold. She stood by the stove and reveled in its warmth.
		John had to have been here since before dawn to get the stove going and warm up the room
		as much as he had. Perhaps he had not even gone home after seeing the women safely to the
		tavern, but had returned to the jail. She was grateful once again for the kindness of this
		gentle man, without whom she would not have had a prayer of getting Josie out of this
		mess.</p>

		<p>After the men had left, John came to join her beside the stove
		and refill his own coffee mug.</p>

		<p>"Don?t worry Miss Rebecca," he said confidently.
		"I have a feeling things will work out all right."</p>

		<p>Rebecca put her hand on his forearm and gave a gentle squeeze.
		"Thank you for everything, John. I don?t know what we would have done without
		your help. If there?s anything Josie or I can do for you I hope you?ll let us
		know."</p>

		<p>He looked slightly embarrassed when she leaned in and kissed him
		on the cheek, and his eyes seemed to be glued to a spot on the floor. Rebecca poured a
		second cup of coffee to take in to Josie and began to walk toward the cells when
		John?s voice stopped her.</p>

		<p>"Miss Rebecca, I wonder if you?d consider?that is,
		when this is all over, would you allow me to?call on you?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca couldn?t believe she hadn?t seen this coming.
		Her preoccupation with Josie?s problems had blinded her to the look on his face that
		was so obvious now. John was such a sweet and kind man and Rebecca could not bear the
		thought of hurting him.</p>

		<p>"Oh, John, that?s very sweet, and I?m honored that
		you would want to court me. But I?m not?free to see other people. My heart is
		committed to another."</p>

		<p>He had been so taken with the lovely young women and felt so
		badly for her when her father made the remark about being stuck with her because she was
		tainted by the company she kept. He had assumed there was no man in her life ?
		mistakenly, it would seem.</p>

		<p>"I?m sorry, I didn?t realize. I?you never
		mentioned having a beau, so?"</p>

		<p>"That?s because I don?t." She looked at him
		and said pointedly, "But I do have a lover."</p>

		<p>His brow furrowed for a moment as he considered her words, and
		then comprehension showed on his face. "Oh, of course. I should have realized.
		I?m not the brightest candle on the tree, I reckon."</p>

		<p>"Don?t sell yourself short. If I were in the market for
		a man, you are exactly the type I would be interested in. And I?m sure there are
		plenty of women out there who would be proud to walk on your arm."</p>

		<p>He simply nodded and walked to the door leading into the cells
		and unlocked it. He swung the door open for her and stood aside to let her pass.</p>

		<p>"I?ll be going to get some breakfast now for Miss
		Josie. Can I fetch you something as well?"</p>

		<p>"I?m not really hungry," she said, surprised to
		note that it was true. It was rare that she was so keyed up she couldn?t think about
		eating, but the upcoming court appearance had her stomach tied up in knots.</p>

		<p>"Deputy won?t be on duty for another hour or so.
		I?d be obliged if you would come fetch me over at Rudy?s if something comes up
		while I?m gone."</p>

		<p>"Of course I will. Thanks again, John."</p>
