<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 20 -->

<p>"I told you. I needed some air" was Sam's response after several long moments.</p>
<p>"That explains why you went outside", Brooke answered quietly. "It doesn't explain why you left without telling me. I was worried about you".</p>
<p>"I know" Sam replied, recalling the concerned messages the blonde left on her phone. "I'm sorry".</p>
<p>Brooke twisted herself around so that she could see Sam's face. </p>
<p>"Did I do something?" Brooke asked nervously. "To offend you?"</p>
<p>"Like what?" Sam asked with a frown. </p>
<p>"Well, I, uh, had a few to drink and when we were dancing I was sort of all over you and maybe I..." Brooke stopped when she realised she was babbling. She shot Sam a sheepish grin. "I know that you don't like people invading your space" she managed finally, not realising that she was doing exactly that.</p>
<p>"Brooke? Hello?" Sam replied with a smile, gesturing to their position.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah" Brooke said. She shook her head, looking up at Sam. "It's just that you left after we danced, and maybe I did something inappropriate or something and I was just really worried and I waited up for you, and...".</p>
<p>"You're channeling Willow again" Sam interrupted with a grin. "Brooke, believe me when I say that you did nothing wrong when we were dancing." </p>
<p>Absolutely nothing wrong, Sam thought with a smirk. </p>
<p>More like everything right. </p>
<p>"So where did you go?" Brooke asked, interrupting Sam's lustful thoughts.</p>
<p>"I went to see Alex" Sam answered, a trace of sadness in her voice. </p>
<p>Brooke turned around and faced the window, not wanting Sam to see the disappointment on her face. She closed her eyes and sighed, wishing for a moment that the lightning would strike her down. It surely couldn't hurt anymore than what she was feeling now.</p>
<p>"So how is he?" she asked, not caring either way.</p>
<p>"I don't think he is very happy with me" Sam admitted sadly. </p>
<p>Shoving aside her own hurt, Brooke glanced at Sam with concern. </p>
<p>"Want to talk about it?" she offered gently.</p>
<p>Sam sighed, suddenly very tired. "He told me that he loved me".</p>
<p>Brooke looked away. "That's a good thing, isn't it?" she commented finally.</p>
<p>"It would be if the person you said it to didn't run out of the room" Sam admitted wryly, causing Brooke's eyes to widen with surprise. Once she was sure that she wasn't hearing things, and was certain that Sam couldn't see her expression, she grinned. </p>
<p>A huge, cheesy, all teeth showing grin.</p>
<p>"I see" Brooke replied finally. "Maybe it's just too soon for you".</p>
<p>"It'll always be too soon" Sam murmured softly.</p>
<p>"Did you say something?" Brooke asked, glancing up at her.</p>
<p>Sam shook her head in response. </p>
<p>"Why are relationships so hard?" she asked sadly. "They hurt so much sometimes".</p>
<p>"When you find the one, it'll all be worth it" Brooke answered.</p>
<p>"You believe in soulmates?" Sam asked with surprise.</p>
<p>"I think everybody has somebody who looks at them and says "You complete me" Brooke answered  with a smile, gazing up into Sam's eyes.</p>
<p>"You complete me, huh?" Sam responded with amusement.</p>
<p>"Yes. "You complete me" Brooke repeated, this time a little more seriously. </p>
<p>Sam's smile widened. "I always preferred "You had me at hello".</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "That works too".</p>
<p>"Alex doesn't complete me" Sam admitted softly, to the one who did.</p>
<p>"Sam, you're only sixteen, in your first real relationship" Brooke said amused. </p>
<p>"Thankyou, Miss Perception USA" Sam reponded sarcastically. </p>
<p>Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"What I was trying to say" Sam continued with a pointed look "is that..."</p>
<p>"It's getting too serious" Brooke interrupted. "He loves you and wants more from you but you don't feel as strongly as he does".</p>
<p>"Yeah. How did you know?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Josh" Brooke answered simply. "Been there done that".</p>
<p>"So you broke up with him" Sam stated.</p>
<p>"It wasn't working" Brooke responded with a shrug. "I wasn't happy and it wasn't fair on him. He adored me and I just couldn't lie". </p>
<p>She softened her voice at Sam's saddened expression.</p>
<p>"You just need to figure out what you want Sam".</p>
<p>"What if I can't have what I want" she replied, gazing directly at Brooke.</p>
<p>"You'll never know if you don't try" Brooke answered, watching as a single tear made it's way down Sam's face. Cupping her left cheek, Brooke placed a gentle kiss on her right.</p>
<p>"It'll be okay Sam" she whispered.</p>
<p>"I don't want to hurt him" she mumbled, burying her face in Brooke's neck. "I don't want to hurt me".</p>
<p>Brooke didn't respond, simply holding Sam as she began to cry. </p>
<p>"Sorry" Sam apologized several minutes later, wiping the tears away.</p>
<p>"Don't be" Brooke answered with a smile. "You feeling better?"</p>
<p>"No" was Sam's frank response.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"Straight to the point, I like it" she quipped, causing Sam to smile.</p>
<p>"I'm not squashing you am I?" Brooke asked, gesturing at their intimate position. "I'm practically sitting on your lap".</p>
<p>"I don't mind" Sam quickly replied. </p>
<p>"Good, because you're comfortable" Brooke said, yawning. "Though I think it might be more wise if we continue this discussion after we both get some sleep. It's almost six."</p>
<p>"Yeah" Sam agreed, yawning herself. She glanced at the window. </p>
<p>"I think the storm has stopped. You should be able to sleep now".</p>
<p>"I'll be fine". Brooke stood up and turned to Sam with a cheeky grin.  "Besides, what harm can dancing elephants do?"</p>
<p>Sam laughed as Brooke helped her up. "That's the spirit".</p>
<p>They watched each other for a moment, unsure of what to do next.</p>
<p>"I better get going" Brooke said.</p>
<p>"I'd prefer that you didn't" Sam replied softly. "Why stop a slumber party half way?"</p>
<p>Brooke nodded, smiling. "Okay".</p>
<p>Sam mumbled tiredly as she climbed into bed and turned on her side.</p>
<p>"Love your pyjamas Brooke". </p>
<p>"So do I" she responded happily. "They're my favourites actually."</p>
<p>Sam glanced over her shoulder with a smile. "I'm glad you like them".</p>
<p>"I don't think I ever thanked you properly" Brooke said a little guiltily.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "We weren't friends back then, remember?".</p>
<p>"So why did you get me something?" Brooke asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Why did you get me something?" Sam asked instead.</p>
<p>"It was Christmas! Besides, I sort of wanted to anyway" The blonde admitted.</p>
<p>"Well, there is your answer" Sam replied. "I don't think I ever thanked you for the diary, so we're both even".</p>
<p>"Did you like it? I know you keep one so I thought maybe you needed another once you're done with it" Brooke explained shyly.</p>
<p>"I love it" Sam said genuinely. "And you'll be happy to know I mention you quite a lot."</p>
<p><i>More like, all the time.</i></p>
<p>"Is that so?" Brooke asked playfully. "I can just imagine what you've written about me".</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "Don't worry, it gradually improves".</p>
<p>"I'm glad it has" Brooke answered with a smile.</p>
<p>Minutes later, on the verge of falling alseep, Sam opened her eyes in surprise when she felt an arm curl around her waist and a warm body press up against her from behind.</p>
<p>"Thanks for the present Sam" Brooke murmured sleepily. "I love Garfield."</p>
<p>"Your welcome" she whispered with a soft laugh, snuggling deeper into the embrace and closing her eyes.</p>
