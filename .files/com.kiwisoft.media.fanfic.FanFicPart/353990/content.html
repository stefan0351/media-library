<!-- The Closet \ Part Sixteen -->

<p>"What is it?" Brooke asked feeling a slight shudder run through Sam's
body.  It was now just past three in the morning and the hustle and
bustle of the day was beginning to catch up with both of them.  Brooke
was leaned propped up against the door and a shelving unit and Sam was
sitting in-between her legs.  "Don't tell me your uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"I'm very comfortable," Sam responded, "in fact you're better than a
futon."</p>

<p>"That's lovely," Brooke responded glaring at the top of Sam's head.
"Are you cold?" she asked feeling another shiver run through Sam's
body.</p>

<p>"No, just thinking about how much shit we're going to be in when they
find us in the morning," Sam said shuddering once again.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that, but now I am, and…" Brooke shuddered too.
"They're going to call our parents.  You are going to be in so much
trouble," Brooke continued.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'me'?" Sam asked.  "As far as I'm aware I'm not the
only one is this room.  What about you?"</p>

<p>"I'll probably get an award for being such a concerned bus buddy and
following you into doom and misfortune," Brooke responded.  "The
school will probably create a new award just for me, the McQueen
Medallion or something more grandiose."</p>

<p>Sam paused for a second then said, "Now that you've had time to rejoin
me on the planet earth, what do you think is really going to happen?"
Sam asked a moment later.</p>

<p>"I'd prefer not to think about it if it's all the same to you," Brooke
replied as she ran her hands up and down Sam's arm lightly.  </p>

<p>Sam smirked then shifted up a little so that her lips were hovering by
Brooke's neck where she planted the gentlest of kisses.  Brooke leaned
her head down, capturing Sam's lips in an equally tender embrace.</p>

<p>"Sam," she said when they separated and Sam's head was once again
resting on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ummm," Sam mumbled.</p>

<p>"I sleepy," Brooke related blinking rapidly in an attempt to keep her
eyes open.</p>

<p>"Me too," Sam admitted with a sigh.  "I didn't get much sleep last
night."</p>

<p>"Hmph," Brooke emoted, surprisingly able to make even her grunts carry
a touch of amusement.  "I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," Sam muttered knowing exactly what Brooke was thinking.  </p>

<p>"Don't be grouchy, I'm sure that it was good for both of us," Brooke
continued smiling as she rested her head against Sam's.  The
brunette's response was merely to focus though brown orbs at her and
place an expression on her face that clearly said 'you're really gonna
wanna shut up now'.  Brooke smiled, she would shut up…but only because
Sam was her girl.</p>
