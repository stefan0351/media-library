<!-- Second Chance \ Prologue -->

<p>You know I'd give anything for a damn radio right about now.
Not to say that this place is all that bad. After all, I came here by
choice. It was my choice to turn myself in so I could make things
right. It's not as bad as I'd imagined prison would be, but the
silence is what kills me. Being left alone with nothing to do but
think all the time is driving me insane. </p>

<p>Okay so maybe I already am insane but what the fuck do I
care? That's the whole point of being here. At least that's what I
keep telling myself. Then I get lost in thought, and I can think of
only one thing, and that's why I'm here. Not because I think coming
here was the right thing to do, but she thought it was right.</p>

<p>She's the reason I hate thinking, because it always leads to
her. I fucking hate her for it. Or maybe I'm just trying to fool
myself into thinking I hate her so things will be easier. Not to say
I'm not sorry for the things I did because I am sorry for most of
them though I don't think I'll ever admit that to anyone. It's hard
enough just letting myself think it.</p>

<p>I don't feel bad that I killed that man at all. It goes along
with the job. Save a few thousand people and your allowed to screw up
along the way, so what's the big deal? They all act like I did it on
purpose. No, it wasn't my choice to stake him, but it happened so why
couldn't they just move on like me? </p>

<p>Instead they make me out to be the bad guy. I'm sorry I ever
came to this damn town and fucked up all their happy little lives. I
know I shouldn't have tried to blame B for it or choked Xander and
all the other shit that I pulled but I couldn't take them all looking
down on me like I was shit. Looking at me the same way my parents did.</p>

<p>Thinking back on it now, I realize all they wanted to do was
help me but I got scared. Why couldn't they just give me time to deal
my own way? They just had to go and force themselves into the
situation acting like they know how it feels. Like everything was
going be fucking peachy. Well none of them have a damn clue about how
it feels to kill someone. Sure they wanted to help, but they looked
at me like I was such a fuck up. </p>

<p>Then that night on the docks when Buffy hit me I snapped. I
know it was my fault because I couldn't keep my damn mouth shut about
soul boy but I was hurt. Just a few days ago things were perfect. Me
and B, the chosen two kicking ass like we were supposed to. I had
everything I'd ever wanted and when I killed him it was snatched away
from me. But the fucking idiot shouldn't have been roaming the alleys
in the first place! </p>

<p>I could take anything, anything in this world, but the way B
looked at me when she hit me. There was nothing but hatred and
disgust in her eyes. I know she saved me from those boxes crashing
down on me but it was too late. I wish it hadn't have been, that I
hadn't been so fucked up. But if they wanted to look at me like I was
shit, I figured I'd give them what they wanted so later that night I
went and joined the mayor.</p>

<p>It would have been best for me to just run as fucking far
from Sunnydale as possible but deep inside me I knew that I couldn't
have lived without seeing B. You know how they say 'keep your friends
close and your enemies closer'? Well I thought if I was her enemy I'd
still get to be around her kicking ass like before. I suppose it was
stupid of me to not realize it would lead to us kicking each others
asses, or her stabbing me but I'm over that now. I would have laid
down my life to protect her, yet it turns out I'm the one who hurt
her the most. Some idiot I am huh?</p>

<p>So then I end up here, in a small attempt to make things
right. I know being behind bars won't make her forgive me but maybe
now she'll realize I'll do anything for her. My only regret is that I
didn't realize that earlier. If I hadn't gotten so scared and just
turned myself in to begin with I wouldn't have lost the greatest
thing I ever had. Even if I don't regret killing him, I should have
done this for her in the first place.</p>

<p>I want to put the blame on them, or at least part of it but
it was never their fault. I didn't know how to deal and I fucked up.
Yeah, I admit it. I fucked up and now I'm sitting here driving myself
crazy because of it. I get out of here soon and I'll do whatever it
takes to get her back, because if I don't... Well I don't think I'll
survive. What's the point when you have nothing to live for? </p>

<p>It's kind of funny, how I can hate her so much even knowing
that I can't survive without her. Maybe the only reason we got along
was because of the slayer connection, but it's still the first time
I've ever felt that alive. Being with her was amazing and I want that
back somehow. As much as I hate her, since being here I've realized
the real reason this all happened. I love her just as much as I hate
her. And I'll be damned if I won't die trying to make things right. I
want the hate and the hurt to go away, so the only thing that remains
is my unconditional love for her.</p>
