<!-- Human Layers \ Part Seven -->

<p>The gang sat on the bleachers in the gym, dressed in the appropriate attire
		along with the rest of the class. Which was the same red t-shirt with 'Sunnydale'
		in yellow lettering on the front, and gray shorts or sweatpants. It allowed the
		teachers and the administration to believe that students had school spirit.
		Cordelia and Willow were sitting on either side of Buffy, and Oz and Xander sat
		a row behind the girls. They were listening to the coach ramble on about
		self-defense.</p>
		<p>"Sunnydale is becoming more dangerous all the time. And a full moon like
		tonight tends to bring out the crazies, but with some simple basics of
		self-defense, each of you can learn how to protect yourself."</p>
		<p>"Here's a suggestion - move away from the Hellmouth." Buffy said,
		quietly.</p>
		<p>Willow watched as the slayer fingered the gold, id bracelet she'd been
		wearing for the past two weeks, and smiled. She said it had been a birthday
		present from Cordelia, and after they'd disposed of the Judge, the brunette had
		given it to her. It was engraved on the back, but the redhead had no idea what
		it meant.</p>
		<p>'9/7/97 - Thank You'</p>
		<p>"What you wanna do is gain advantage of the situation as quickly as
		possible." The coach continued.</p>

		<p>Oz reached forward and put the tag inside his girlfriend's collar; it was
		sticking out. They were officially a couple now. She had a musician boyfriend.
		Ecstatic didn't even begin to cover how happy she was. She turned to him
		questioningly.</p>
		<p>"Tag." He patted her back, and she smiled at Buffy and Cordelia.</p>
		<p>"Your attacker may have the benefit of surprise, but if you plot ahead,
		then you can turn that advantage to yourself. By being prepared, you have the
		power. Okay, everyone get into your assigned groups."</p>
		<p>Buffy got up, smiling at the cheerleader, and the coach looked at her.</p>
		<p>"You'll have to take that off, Miss Summers." The woman gestured to
		the bracelet. "I'm sure you don't want to risk it getting broken."</p>
		<p>She shook her head. "Nope, don't want that."</p>

		<p>Buffy didn't want to remove it either, but she'd rather not upset a woman
		with chest hair.</p>
		<p>"I'll take it." Willow offered. "I've got pockets." She
		was wearing a sweat-jacket overtop of her shirt.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Will." Buffy removed it from her wrist carefully, handed
		it over, and then walked onto the mats.</p>
		<p>The hacker looked at it, trying to figure out the date. Cordelia whispered to
		her, smiling.</p>
		<p>"First time she kissed me." She moved to where she was assigned,
		and waited for Xander. He was going to be the attacker; she was going to get to
		hurt him.</p>

		<p>Finally, a class she could enjoy.</p>
		<p>Willow's mouth formed an O as recognition set in, and her face brightened.
		That was uncharacteristically sweet. She placed the bracelet in a pocket while
		going to wait for Oz, her partner for the exercise. She and Cordelia had put the
		'yelling incident' behind them, but she thought she'd gotten off easy, and
		planned to use the forgiveness as fuel to establish a friendship with her. Aside
		from being a cheerleader, Cordelia was one of the outcasts now. The brunette was
		handling it well, but Willow still wanted her to feel as accepted as possible.</p>
		<p>The men were over at the table, along with Larry, the school's head jock.</p>
		<p>"What happened?" Xander asked, his eyes drifting to a bandage on
		Larry's arm.</p>
		<p>"Oh, last week some huge dog jumped out of the bushes and bit me.
		Thirty-nine stitches. They oughta shoot those strays."</p>
		<p>"I've been there, man." Oz held up his finger. "My cousin
		Jordy just got his grownup teeth in? Does not like to be tickled."</p>

		<p>"So, Harris, that thing going around about Buffy taking our best meat
		off the market, it true? Cause that's a damn shame. Chase was Grade A of the
		highest quality. And here I always thought you just couldn't close the
		deal."</p>
		<p>If he had about fifty or sixty more pounds of muscle, Xander would've decked
		him, but he didn't, so he kept his cool.</p>
		<p>"You wanna know, Lar? Ask her." Larry glanced at Buffy, somewhat
		frightened. "Or not."</p>
		<p>Separating, Oz and Xander exchanged smirks and headed over to where they were
		supposed to be. Larry came up to a girl who was doing stretching exercises.</p>
		<p>"Theresa!" She straightened. "Be still my shorts. We're in the
		same group." He chuckled. "I may have to attack you."</p>

		<p>"No, a-a-actually, I think, uh, in our group there are a few of
		us." Theresa informed him.</p>
		<p>Buffy joined them. "And I'm one of the few. Was there something you
		wanted to ask me?" She had overheard everything. "It's not my opinion
		on the O-Zone, is it? Cause you don't wanna get me started." He just stood
		there. "Come on, you have a burning desire to learn. I can tell these
		things. So ask away."</p>
		<p>Willow dragged her away from him, then. "Don't forget, you're supposed
		to be a meek, little girlie-girl like the rest of us."</p>
		<p>The slayer watched the redhead go back to her spot, and pouted slightly.

		"Spoil my fun."</p>
		<p>A few minutes later, the coach had explained what they were going to do, and
		Larry had his arm around Buffy's neck. For some reason he felt more powerful
		now. She was pretending to attempt to flip him over, adding in a few false
		grunts for good measure. Everyone else had been doing the same exercise, but was
		now stopping to look in their direction.</p>
		<p>"Why doesn't she just -?" Cordelia began to ask Xander, and then
		saw Larry grab her girlfriend's backside. She gasped. "If she doesn't, I
		will."</p>
		<p>Within a second, Larry was groaning on his back. He might not have gotten the
		answer he'd been looking for, but he sure got a message.</p>
		<p>"Meat's bad for you, didn't you know?" Buffy told him.
		"Vegetables are a lot healthier. See what they've done for me?"</p>
		<p>"I love it when she does that." Xander smiled.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but the pain'll wear off. Do you wanna know what I would've
		done?"</p>
		<p>Xander backed away from her. He didn't really need, or want, a demonstration.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>"All I'm saying is, that it would've been more permanent, and a hell of
		a lot more satisfying. Especially if you did it." Cordelia was telling
		Buffy as they walked into the library with the rest of their friends.</p>
		<p>"Four words - Snyder. My life. Unbearable." Buffy responded.
		"This is the longest I've stayed below his radar; a few more weeks and I'm
		up for a medal. At least that's what the janitor told me."</p>
		<p>"Hey, I've got no love for Larry, but I wouldn't wish *that* on any
		registered male in the gender." Xander said with a cringe. "Except
		maybe Angel." Buffy glared. "You're with me on this, right, Oz?"</p>

		<p>"It's off-limits." The guitarist agreed.</p>
		<p>Willow couldn't contribute. She was blushing too much.</p>
		<p>"See how much I don't care?" Cordelia asked. "Weaknesses are
		meant to be exploited."</p>
		<p>Buffy raised her eyebrows. Cordelia was apparently unforgiving to people who
		hurt or upset her, and the slayer made a mental note of that; she'd avoid
		causing her pain at all costs. She loved her and enjoyed her company. Why would
		she want to throw that away?</p>
		<p>"I'm glad you're on my side." She gave her a quick kiss.</p>

		<p>"Do they sell cups to non-athletes?" Xander wondered. The glint in
		the brunette's eye worried him.</p>
		<p>"I-I...I need a book. Any book." Willow announced. "Ooh! <i>See
		Spot Run</i>! Or...<i>The Cat in the Hat</i>!"</p>
		<p>They were looking at her strangely, but this was making her feel better.
		Memories of innocent, harmless, childhood books with no talk of...boy stuff. Or
		girl stuff.</p>
		<p>"Remember? His hat was real long and big and there was lots of stuff
		insi..." The redhead trailed off, her eyes widening. When did her mind
		become so corrupted? She had to focus on something else. The table; there was
		something on the table. "Look! A globe!" She pointed, and then
		proceeded to bite her fingernails.</p>

		<p>Buffy gulped. "A globe?" The slayer backed up towards the doors,
		Xander following her lead. She reached for Cordelia's hand, glancing around.
		They had to get out. "Are there diagrams?"</p>
		<p>"The day's still young." Xander commented. "Give it
		time."</p>
		<p>They continued reversing, but bumped right into Giles, who had come in.</p>
		<p>"Giles!" Buffy exclaimed, whirling around. "We were just,
		uh...hoping we'd run into you. Weren't we, guys?" Cordelia and Xander
		nodded with her. "You know, this being the library and all..." She
		gave her watcher a weak smile. "But literally running into you was -"</p>

		<p>"An unexpected bonus." Xander interrupted with a nervous laugh.
		"Have I told you lately how much I think librarian is a fantastic career
		choice?"</p>
		<p>He eyed the two children. "I found something in the paper this morning.
		It might simply be coincidence, but I have a theory you'll all want to hear. And
		I should accompany you on patrol tonight, Buffy. I suspect you'll need the
		aid."</p>
		<p>The slayer embraced her girlfriend. "Save me."</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p ALIGN="left">Angel's apartment looked like it had been ransacked.</p>
		<p>Books were scattered all over, his table was smashed to bits, his pictures
		and paintings were torn, and their frames were broken. The statue that he kept
		locked in its own glass case, was in pieces. His fridge was lying open on the
		floor, the packets inside, all drained. There was blood splattered everywhere.
		His desk, chair, and armoire were shoved up against the door, and the cord for
		his phone had been ripped from the wall.</p>

		<p>In the bedroom, he sat with covers around him and shivering, his back against
		the wall. His face was ashen; in a couple days, his cheekbones would be visible
		beneath his skin. He couldn't remember the last time he'd fed, and though he
		wanted to, he knew he couldn't. He had destroyed his home, and barricaded
		himself inside of it. He didn't understand why, but the curse had somehow lost
		the grip it'd once had, and was no longer keeping his demon at bay.</p>
		<p>He had to fight alone. Fight for control of his own body. It wanted to kill
		again, and do even far worse things. Angel was using every ounce of strength he
		possessed, to prevent that from happening. He'd spoiled his blood supply and
		starved himself, in an effort to weaken the demon. He had no choice.</p>
		<p>"You gave this up when you asked her to let me in, Soul Boy. It doesn't
		belong to you anymore." Angelus said.</p>
		<i>
		<p>- I'm not afraid. Show me. Show me your world. -</p>
		</i>
		<p>"This was clever in theory, but it backfired. We both know you don't
		have the energy to keep this up, and when the sun goes down, you'll let go, and
		I'm gonna bleed the first girl I see. What do you think the odds are she'll be a
		blonde? I've developed a taste for one."</p>
		<p>"I won't let you touch her." He swore.</p>

		<p>"You haven't seen her in weeks, she hasn't come by to check on you...I
		thought she was supposed to care? She forgot you, and you'd still die to protect
		her. Do us a favor and open your eyes already."</p>
		<p>"She's living her life. She's got more important things...to worry
		about."</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah. She's the Slayer. Saves the world, so it has to revolve around
		her. They're all the same, but you fell for her act. She's probably too wrapped
		up in her new toy to see anyone else, or to give a damn about you. What a bitch,
		huh?"</p>
		<p>Angel ignored it. He knew what it was trying to do. He would never hate Buffy;
		he knew what kind of person she was. If she had been happy with Cordelia these
		past couple weeks, good. She should take advantage of the time she had.</p>
		<p>"If you go out there," He told his demon, "he'll hunt us
		down."</p>
		<p>"Who, Spike? Now I'm scared." He said sarcastically. "He'll be
		spinning his wheels for awhile, and if he sends his recruits...fine. They're all
		a joke. I bet he hasn't even stopped mourning yet. He picks the wrong ones to
		get attached to. Like you. I mean, Dru and I had our games -"</p>

		<p>"I'm nothing like Spike."</p>
		<p>He laughed. "I knew when she chose him he was gonna be a problem. Too
		much..." It wasn't going to say the 'L word.' "He's too much like a
		human. He killed when he had to, or he killed to impress her, but he never had a
		passion for it. The railroad spikes were my idea. I gave him his reputation, and
		how'd he show his gratitude? By using every chance he got to give me a reason to
		tear his throat out."</p>
		<p>"What...?"</p>
		<p>Demons didn't feel anything.</p>
		<p>"After a century you still don't get it? I guess I shouldn't be
		surprised; you are the human half. You're like them - you think you do, but you
		don't. When we worked together you seemed smarter. Oh well. I've got time for a
		lesson.</p>
		<p>"People leave behind more than they think when we take over. Demons. We
		twist and play with whatever's left, but what we get to work with depends on who
		they were. Dru wasn't evil, just someone with a gift. And I wanted it."</p>
		<p>"She was a young girl who was frightened of what she had, and you took
		advantage of her." Angel said, angrily.</p>

		<p>"It sounds so wrong when you put it like that." His mouth curved
		into a twisted smile. "To make her the best vampire she could be, I had to
		drive her nuts before I turned her. Well, that, and I was in the mood. But even
		after she woke up, she loved her family. And me."</p>
		<p>"She hated you, too."</p>
		<p>"Her mind was funny that way." He smirked. "When I got
		here," Angel's hand touched his chest, "you didn't care about
		anything. Spike cared too much, but you...you were full of rage. I had fun with
		that." His face shifted to vampiric form, and he licked his lips.
		"Mm...can't wait to pick up where I left off."</p>

		<p>Tears of blood ran down his cheeks. Not again.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>"I think it should go left twice, right three times, and then finish
		with a V." Kelli said, demonstrating with her pom-poms.</p>
		<p>Cordelia was co-captain of the squad this year, alongside Joy. They were
		having a night practice in the gym, and she had been very let down by the lack
		of talent and creativity. Cheerleading did require skill, though some people
		refused to believe that, and the girls who tried out had none. But they had to
		go with them, because if they didn't, Sunnydale wouldn't have a cheering
		section.</p>
		<p>Scanning the group, she saw the looks they were giving her. Some were
		disgusted, others were scared, but she was generally being looked down upon. A
		few of them were part of her once flock. They thought they were better than her?
		That was a laugh. No, Larry hadn't been the first to bring up her
		"change." In the beginning it was uncomfortable, now she was just
		getting annoyed.</p>

		<p>It was sad when she'd rather be hunting werewolves in the dark with a
		librarian and her girlfriend, but it'd be more enjoyable than this.</p>
		<p>"What do you think?" Joy was asking her.</p>
		<p>"We need a new routine, but the game's tomorrow, and..." Kelli
		glared at her, and she could hear muffled giggling. "That's it, I've had
		enough. It's time to deal with this."</p>
		<p>"Cordelia -"</p>
		<p>"You've heard the rumors, right? Well, they're all true. There. It's out
		in the open." She waited for the gasps to subside. "Yep, Buffy Summers
		and Cordelia Chase are a thing. We've kissed, we've dated a couple times, and
		who knows? We might even have sex."</p>

		<p>And the second wave came. "Eew."</p>
		<p>"Ashley? Your mouth? Close it." The brunette ordered. "I'm
		sure you have your own issues with that, but I don't give a damn. I'm happy with
		my life, and if you decide not to acknowledge me anymore, I hope you don't
		expect me to think it'll be a huge loss. Cause it won't be. I've got friends.
		Actual friends."</p>
		<p>All the girls looked around at each other. She had them there.</p>
		<p>"I'm still a captain of this squad. I've earned it; so if I don't like
		something, live with it. Out there you can choose to act like I don't exist, but
		in here, I call the shots. Maybe I'm not who I was..." She thought about
		that. "No, I know I'm not, but if you think you can mess with me and get
		away with it, think again. And yeah, that is a threat."</p>
		<p>"What are you gonna do to us?" Kimberly timidly asked.</p>

		<p>She was in control, and she loved it. "Don't worry, I'm not gonna molest
		you in the showers or check out your ass, cause...yuck, but if I hear anybody
		saying anything about me and Buffy, and I mean *anything*, I will shove my foot
		in it. Besides, you all owe her big time, and you know it. Do what I say, and
		you'll be safe. But I'm not gonna put up with this crap. Are we clear now?"</p>
		<p>"Uh huh...yeah...totally..." Came the replies.</p>
		<p>"So you're finished?" Joy smirked.</p>
		<p>"Cheer on." Cordelia said with a nod.</p>
		<p>She was pleased with her work. They feared her again.</p>

		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>"This is all so weird. I mean, how are we supposed to act when we see
		him?" Xander was asking Buffy as they walked into the lounge two days
		later.</p>
		<p>Oz had turned out to be the werewolf, but thankfully, he hadn't hurt anyone.
		Willow ended up shooting him; it was no secret that they had a lot to discuss.
		Buffy hoped for her friend's sake that they could work through it, because they
		seemed perfect for one another, and she didn't want the redhead to lose that.</p>
		<p>But Xander wasn't talking about the guitarist. He had interrogated Larry
		about his dog bite, and came away from the experience knowing things he hadn't
		wanted to find out. Also, wrong impressions were given.</p>
		<p>"Well, it's gotta be weird for him, too. Now that we know so much."
		The slayer said in response.</p>
		<p>"All I know is I'll never be able to look at him the same again."</p>
		<p>"He's still a human being. Most of the time."</p>

		<p>They stopped at the vending machine, where Xander realized that they weren't
		quite on the same page. "Who are we talking about?"</p>
		<p>"Oz. Who are you talking about?"</p>
		<p>"No one."</p>
		<p>His eyes found Larry and Friends by the stairs; one of them knocked books out
		of a girl's hands. While they laughed, Larry picked up the books and gave them
		back to her. Buffy watched the scene with surprise, and stayed calm as he came
		over.</p>
		<p>"Hey! Xander, look, about what you did...I-I owe you."</p>
		<p>"What'd you do?" She wondered.</p>
		<p>"It's really nothing we should be talking about." Xander said to
		Buffy, and then turned to Larry. "Ever."</p>

		<p>"I know, I know. It's just, well," The football jock smiled
		gratefully and patted him on the back, "thanks."</p>
		<p>"That was weird." Buffy commented as he left.</p>
		<p>She and Xander went and sat at a table.</p>
		<p>"What? It's not okay for one guy to like another guy just because he
		happened to be in the locker room with him when absolutely nothing
		happened...and I thought I told you not to push." Willow's babble habit was
		catchy.</p>
		<p>"All I meant is that he didn't try to look up my skirt."</p>

		<p>Xander fidgeted nervously with his hands, smiling. "Oh-oh, yeah,
		that's-that's the weirdness."</p>
		<p>"Weirdness abounds lately. Maybe it's the moon. Does stuff to
		people."</p>
		<p>She smiled as she saw Cordelia enter the lounge, and the brunette soon joined
		them, kissing her girlfriend and pulling up a chair.</p>
		<p>"Like that?" He questioned, blushing.</p>
		<p>"What's with the public display?" Buffy asked Cordelia. "Not
		that I mind, cause I don't, but I thought -?"</p>
		<p>"I'm the Queen, Buffy. They may not like it, but my subjects obey
		me." The cheerleader grinned. "Oh, guess what? Larry apologized to me
		after second period. Which in itself was bizarre, but then he said he was gay
		and that he'd always be 'available to talk.' Just like that. Are we supposed to
		share a secret bond now?"</p>

		<p>"He's gay? Where'd that come from?"</p>
		<p>"He's...? My God. Really? Man. You know, you see a guy every day -"
		Xander started ranting and was interrupted.</p>
		<p>"He thinks you helped him." Cordelia said, suspiciously. "Why
		would he think that?"</p>
		<p>"Something you wanna tell us, Xand?" Buffy smirked.</p>
		<p>Larry's gratitude was suddenly making sense.</p>

		<p>He sighed. "There were mixed signals, okay? It's girls all the way for
		me. The image of you two naked and covered in chocolate, and the hope that at
		some point in the near future I'll get to witness it, is what gets me up in the
		morning." He saw their angry faces. "I see I've proved my point."</p>
		<p>They sat quietly for a few minutes, blocking out Xander's hormonal, wet dream
		comments. Though the girls did get their own enjoyment out of picturing that
		image. They weren't going to admit that to him, however. Where would they get
		that much chocolate?</p>
		<p>Cordelia frowned as she saw people placing flowers by a girl's locker.
		"So a vampire killed Theresa? For sure?" She asked in a whisper.</p>
		<p>"That's what bite marks on the neck usually mean." The slayer said,
		sadly. "The one who did it is still out there."</p>

		<p>Cordelia had a strong urge to hold her, but that was one line Snyder wouldn't
		let any couple cross. She could see how hard this was on her. Every victim
		stuck, and to make it worse, Buffy had talked to Theresa in class only days ago,
		saving her from one beast, but not able to save her from another.</p>
		<p>The brunette settled for holding her hand. "Must be a relief for Oz,
		though. And for Willow."</p>
		<p>"But think about it." Xander chimed in. "I mean, what life
		could they possibly have together? We're talking obedience school, paper
		training, Oz is always in backyard burying their things, and that kind of breed
		can turn on its owner."</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Buffy disagreed. "I kinda see Oz as the loyal
		type."</p>
		<p>"All I'm saying is she's not safe with him. If it were up to me -"</p>

		<p>"Xander...it's not up to you." She told him. It was Willow's
		choice.</p>
		<p>"Get Angel to ask around. About Theresa. He could find out who did
		it." Cordelia realized. It had just occurred to her while she'd been
		ignoring Xander. "I don't feel threatened anymore, I swear."</p>
		<p>Buffy smiled. "I could. Maybe. I haven't seen him in awhile...figured he
		needed time to himself."</p>
		<p>"To deal with the fact that Cordy won?" Xander asked with a grin.
		"I applaud that decision, by the way."</p>

		<p>She narrowed her eyes. "But he should've warned me about some big danger
		by now."</p>
		<p>"He's a grown vampire; he can take care of himself." Her friend
		said. "Damn it, Buff! You're a slayer, not a babysitter!" Blank stares
		were the worst. "Star Trek. Classic TV."</p>
		<p>"One day I'll understand you." Buffy remarked, shaking her head.</p>
		<p>"Not me." Cordelia smiled. "Why waste my brain cells? I'd only
		end up dumbing myself down to your low, *low* level and killing my IQ." She
		thought. "Yeah, I'm more than happy to stay ignorant of your layers. If
		they exist."</p>

		<p>"Ho, ho, that was full of hilarity." Xander said, sarcastically.</p>
		<p>She waited.</p>
		<p>"What? No comeback? That was just my warm up."</p>
		<p>"Don't you see her glare?"</p>
		<p>Buffy was indeed glaring. Their bickering got on her nerves.</p>
		<p>"If I stayed ignorant of *your* layers, we wouldn't be here." She
		reminded her girlfriend.</p>
		<p>"But he's -"</p>

		<p>"Shush." She kissed her to halt the protest. "Play nice."</p>
		<p>Though Cordelia did have a good idea. She couldn't let that vampire live.</p>
