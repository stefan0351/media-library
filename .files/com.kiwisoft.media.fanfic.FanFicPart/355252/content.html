<!-- Telling Series \ Section 2: Lily & Josh - All The Better To Kick Your Ass With -->

<p>"So, what's up, Sam? You haven't wanted to hang out in like
forever," Lily said as she, Josh, Sam and Brooke sat down in the livingroom of
the Palace. Mike and Jane went out to a movie. (Sam and Brooke had enjoyed a
very long shower the night before.) Sam looked at Brooke who did her best to
ignore her and shrugged. </p>
<p>"Nothing much, Lily," Sam answered, annoyed at the game of
Let's-Ignore-Sam that Brooke had been playing since school that day. Lily
settled on the couch with Josh and watched her friend with an appraising eye. </p>
<p>"You haven't been around much lately. I thought maybe you had
yourself a special someone that was taking up all your time," Lily teased as
Josh handed her a soda. Sam glared at Brooke's back before answering.
</p>
<p>"So did I. I must have been wrong," Sam couldn't help the
acidic comment from escaping her. This whole thing had been Brooke's idea and
now it seemed to Sam that she was hanging her out to dry and it pissed her off.
She watched Brooke whirl around towards her, a hurt and desperate look on her
face. </p>
<p>"Excuse me a second," Brooke said, eyes brimming with unshed
tears, as she left the room. Sam sighed and mentally shot herself. She banged
the back of her head on the chair repeatedly. </p>
<p>"What's wrong with Brooke?" Josh asked, concerned as he
watched her exit the room like her shirt was on fire. Sam sighed again.
</p>
<p>"Not enough iron in her diet. Start the movie while I go get
her," Sam stood up and followed the upset cheerleader out into the kitchen. </p>
<p>Brooke was leaning over the sink crying. (I hate myself
sometimes) Sam thought. She wrapped her arms around the thin frame and hugged
her from behind. </p>
<p>"That was mean," Brooke sniffed. </p>
<p>"I know. I swear, sometimes it's like `open mouth, insert size
10 Adidas'" Brooke turned around in Sam's arms so that she was facing her and
tilted her head, a funny look on her face. </p>
<p>"What?" Sam asked defensively. </p>
<p>"Gee, you've got awfully big feet, Sam," Brooke said with a
laugh. Sam glared but her eyes lacked the malice to make the action threatening. </p>
<p>"Watch it, I'm trying to apologize here. It doesn't happen
often and if you're not careful, you might miss it." </p>
<p>"Sorry," Brooke said, chagrined. Sam kissed her lightly. </p>
<p>"Now, I said what I did because I was upset. You've been
avoiding me or ignoring me all day. Did I do something to upset you?" Brooke
shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, not at all. God, Sammy, I'm sorry. I'm just nervous about
telling them, that's all. I mean, I'm about to tell Lily and my ex boyfriend
that I'm gay. It's scary." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"I know, babe. I'm in the same boat, remember? And at least if
it's going to sink, we go down together, OK?" Brooke's eyebrows rose at the last
statement. "Oh, get your mind out of the gutter, McQueen. I swear if anyone knew
how lewd you actually were you never would have made homecoming queen."
</p>
<p>"Actually, I probably would have gotten more votes," Brooke
countered. </p>
<p>"This is true. So, are you ready to go back out there?" Brooke
shook her head. </p>
<p>"Anxious to feed me to the lions?" she joked nervously. Sam
sighed. </p>
<p>"Look, what `s the worse that can happen? They totally freak
out and we lose two friends, they tell the whole school and?suddenly I don't
feel so well," Sam flopped down in a kitchen chair and looked up a Brooke. "You
know, you got me all gung-ho for this and now I'm nervous. Nice job." Brooke
hugged her around the shoulders. </p>
<p>"Good, now we can both throw up on their shoes." </p>
