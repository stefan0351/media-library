<p style="text-align:center;"><i><u>What I didn't know</u></i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Chapter 4: A thought and a Smile</i></p>
<p>I barely slept last night. My mind kept playing with Lily's words giving a lot of possibilities to them. Part of my brain said there was always a chance she wasn't talking about me, but the other part knew that was a very slim likelihood.</p>
<p>I do not know why I keep replaying them in my head. The fact that Lily might be gay doesn't bother me at all. The fact that she might like me doesn't change anything either. It is almost the same to me as when a random boy likes me; almost. For this is not a random boy or girl, this is Lily, and although her feelings for me do not trouble our friendship, I do not know what to think of them. I know I shouldn't even ponder about them, since I do not feel the same, but the verity that I play with the possibilities in my slightly aware subconscious even when I deny it consciously leave me quite baffled.</p>
<p>I ate my breakfast quickly this morning before walking alone to school. I did not want to coincidentally find Lily on my way there. Today been Monday, Lily was bout to be late; this is the reason we never walked together on this first day of the weeks. A good thing at the moment too, I want some time to think on my next action.</p>
<p>I mean, I know I will return Lily's notebook to her today. I don't know how yet, I could sneak it into her backpack or ask if I could come over and leave it in her room, but I'll find a way. Still, there are two more poems dedicated to that mysterious girl, or rather to me. And I know I said I wouldn't read anymore, but you know me. I am so curious to know what else she has written with me in her mind; what else does she think of me?</p>
<p>Reaching the school, I pass the gates, climb the few steps and enter through the front doors. I walk straight to my locker and open it, then proceed to fill it with the books stacked in my backpack; the ones I'm sure I will not use today. The last thing I take out is Lily's notebook. I am considering where to stock it, should I take it with me or leave it here?</p>
<p>Dropping my backpack on the floor, I guide the notebook into my locker, but instead of dropping it within it, I open it. You see, last night before falling asleep I read the title of the next poem and I would say little if I said it intrigued me. The title is 'A Thought and a Smile'. I have no idea if it's dedicated to me as well, but something tells me to read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>A Thought and a Smile</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I always think of you<br>
When I want to smile<br>
I don't know what you do<br>
But you make me run the other mile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Time is passing by<br>
And the truth is<br>
That someday you'll say goodbye<br>
And I know I'll cry.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I called you right now<br>
But you weren't there to hear me out<br>
I guess I should let it go<br>
But that's not what I want though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I need to hear your voice<br>
To know everything's alright in the world<br>
There's no choice<br>
In you I rejoice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Somehow<br>
You are able to put me at ease<br>
When I'm with you<br>
I feel this wonderful breeze<br>
That makes my heart unfreeze.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I always think of you<br>
When I want to smile<br>
I don't know what you do<br>
But you make me run the other mile.</p>
<p>Is this what I make her feel? They say that when people are in love they release their whole potential. When people fall in love, they become what they never thought they could, what they never even wanted to, but because of that one person they now do, just for them.</p>
<p>I can think of so many things that Lily is now that she wasn't before. Not only in the academic department, also in the sports she is more competitive and as a person she is more gentle than before. She is even more feminine now. She has changed as Lola too; she went from slightly embarrassing and dorky, to refined and dignified. You could say Lily has made and holistic change.</p>
<p>As I re-read her words, I can only think of all the guys that have showered me with compliments. They chant how pretty I am, or they say things like 'There's no more beautiful flower in this world'. They name each one of my features that they like, and go as far as naming stars after me. The feeling I get in those occasions is ego-lifting. Who does not like to be praised for their beauty?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, never has one of them told me how they need my voice to feel at ease. How I make them smile even when I do nothing, just by a mere thought of my being. Here is Lily, who dares not tell me such things, but she ventures to write them in paper. What I feel in this moment is not ego-lifting, but soul lifting. It elates my heart to know I can make someone feel like that, even if that person is Lily.</p>
<p>No, especially because that person is Lily.</p>
<p>My head shots to the left when I hear the schools doors open and I'm glad the locker's door covers my hands. For there is Lily walking towards me with a smile on her face. I have always thought she had the cutest smile, now that I think of it. And in that second I recall that paragraph of her poem the one that has, and will always, be engraved into my memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I always think of you<br>
When I want to smile<br>
I don't know what you do<br>
But you make me run the other mile.</p>
<p>I lay her notebook on my locker and close its door, all the while with a smile of my own as I watch her walk up to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">To be continuedâ€¦</p>
