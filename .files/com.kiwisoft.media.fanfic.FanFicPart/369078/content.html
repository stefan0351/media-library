<p>Thank you to everyone who is still reading and especially those of you consistently reviewing this story. If it wasn't for you, I'd likely never remember to get this thing updated! So I think we've hit the homestretch - there are only maybe 2 or 3 chapters left after this. Maybe you'll finally get some answers...or I'll just keep all the secrets ;)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter XIII</b></p>
<p>A storm raged outside, banging the shutters against the window, while the strong wind howled around the house. It had been going for hours now with no end in sight and every once in a while the lights would flicker, threatening the inevitable power outage. For now, however, the power stayed on and Lilly continued to read by the soft light of the bedside lamp. If someone were to ask what she had been reading for the past hour, she'd be unable to give an answer, for her eyes had scanned the rows and letters and her mouth spoken the words, but her thoughts were running wild.</p>
<p>Other than the noises of the storm outside, she heard nothing and lowered the book. Something nudged her belly and she looked down at Miley curled up across her lap. Miley had been mostly unresponsive all day and hadn't spoken a single word since Lilly's arrival, communicating merely by nods and grunts. Lilly had offered to read to her, unable to think of any other comfort she could offer and Miley had silently accepted by curling up against her girlfriend. Lilly had assumed the other girl had fallen asleep a while ago, but apparently she'd been wrong.</p>
<p>"Why'd you stop?" Miley's voice was raspy and quiet, though Lilly was happy just to hear her speak. There'd been too many days recently where Miley hadn't spoken at all.</p>
<p>"I thought you fell asleep," said Lilly, her own voice soft. She ran her fingers through Miley's hair, though at this point she wasn't even sure it was offering her girlfriend any comfort. In the weeks that Miley had been sick everyone had tried every way they knew how to make her feel better, to no avail.</p>
<p>Miley was silent and Lilly figured she'd gone back into whatever daydream or stupor she now spent most of her time in, but eventually the younger girl spoke. "Every time I sleepâ€¦I dream about going outside."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what to say to that. Miley's love for the outdoors was no secret, but ever since being forced to stay inside she'd been adamant she needed to be outside. Lilly threw a quick glance at the window above the bed, the wooden shutters closed and bolted shut with a thick lock on the inside that couldn't be broken. Lilly knew Miley had tried and that scared her even more. Miley was not a violent person normally. Lilly sighed, wishing she could just have her girlfriend back, or Susan her daughter, or Miley her own quirky, adorable and energetic self.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to keep reading?" asked Lilly eventually, forcing the what-ifs from her mind. Miley was going to get better, she had to. Anything else was unacceptable.</p>
<p>"When are you going to UCLA?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked down at her girlfriend, stunned. She hadn't mentioned her acceptance to Miley, still waiting for the right time. "What?"</p>
<p>"You got in, didn't you? When are you leaving?" Miley's voice sounded neutral and Lilly couldn't tell if she was upset. Maybe she was just hallucinating.</p>
<p>"How do you know I got in?" asked Lilly, aiming to avoid the question. She felt Miley shrug and sighed. This was as good a time as any to have this conversation, considering the circumstances. "I haven't decided yet, Miles. There's still some time. I also got into Middle Tennessee."</p>
<p>"When do you have to leave for UCLA?" asked Miley, her tone anything but angry or accusatory. She sounded so sure it had Lilly confused.</p>
<p>"<b>If</b> I go to UCLA, August. But it's notâ€¦"</p>
<p>Miley reached out a hand to grasp Lilly's, effectively cutting her off. "Three months. We better make the most of it."</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed the lump suddenly in her throat, unable to speak. She hadn't yet made a decision, but Miley sounded so certain Lilly didn't know what to think. She squeezed her girlfriend's hand and returned her attention to the book in her hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you for doing this, Richard. I don't know what I'd do without you."</p>
<p>Richard nodded, only half-heartedly listening to Susan's words as she bustled around him getting ready. His eyes were glued to the heap of blankets just barely visible from under the built-in kitchen bench. There had been no discernible movement from the heap since he'd entered the kitchen and someone else may have dismissed it as really nothing more than a bunch of blankets. Richard knew better â€“ the heap was the reason he was here after all.</p>
<p>He felt Susan's hand on his arm and tore his gaze away from the heap to meet her eyes. She was worried, had been for the entire month of Miley's illness and strange behavior, but he understood why she was stalling now. She had hardly left her daughter's side in weeks, but now, faced with losing her job and their sole steady income Susan had little choice but to entrust Miley's well-being to someone else. Richard knew he was not her first choice.</p>
<p>"Lilly will be by as soon as she's done with school. It shouldn't be too long. Miley's really been too sick to move, but do <b>not</b> let her out of your sight regardless."</p>
<p>Richard nodded again, though Susan could easily tell she did not have his full attention. "What did I just say?"</p>
<p>"I will not let her out of my sight, Susan, you have my word. Now go, before you're late." Richard put on his best smile, trying to comfort her into leaving. Her eyes strayed to the heap under the bench and back to him, but Richard gave her a reassuring nod and almost walked her to the door, before he remembered the promise he had just made. He gave Susan a quick kiss and ushered her out of the kitchen, waiting the several moments before he heard the click of the front door to turn back to his charge.</p>
<p>From Susan's description, he had half expected Miley to try and make a run for it every time someone's eyes were averted, but the girl had still not moved. Though some of her escape attempts had been quite violent, Miley had not succeeded in getting out of the house. Grandma Ruby, who did not have the strength to restrain her granddaughter, was now unable to safely watch Miley and Susan had turned to Richard for help. He actually felt touched Susan trusted him with her daughter; he'd come to care for the woman quite a bit, even if it had not been planned, and was almost sad he'd have to break that trust.</p>
<p>"So, Miley, looks like it's just you and me now," said Richard and sat on the bench perpendicular to the one Miley was under. He received no answer and though he honestly couldn't say he was surprised, he frowned nevertheless. He'd known Miley close to a year now and he knew she didn't trust him, hated him even, but she'd usually resorted to a snide comment or glare to let him know just how much she did not want him around. Richard couldn't remember the last time she'd even acknowledged his presence.</p>
<p>"Miley, come on." He wasn't sure exactly what he wanted her to do, but Richard knew he was running out of time. His superiors were furious with him and Miley was wasting away without explanation. Richard drummed his fingers on the table, eyes scanning the many papers spread out before him. Blood test results and scans and examinations, all negative, of course, and more bills than he knew Susan could afford.</p>
<p>Richard glanced at the bench he knew Miley to be under and took a deep breath. He stood and moved the table away from the bench. Richard crouched down in front of the heap of blankets, still seeing no movement. He grabbed the nearest blanket and stood, pulling the entire heap, and Miley, out from under the bench.</p>
<p>Miley did not fight him, not as he pulled her out from her hiding spot and not when he removed the blankets covering her. Richard looked down at the girl, her blue eyes staring up at him unseeing. She started shivering, lying on her thin blanket on the cool kitchen floor in her sweat pants and tank top, her feet bare as always. Richard crouched down and put his hand on her shoulder. Miley did not react.</p>
<p>"Miley," he said. If he hadn't seen her shivering, noticed her breathing Richard may have very well assumed she was dead.</p>
<p>Richard stood and reached for his phone, his eyes never leaving Miley on the ground. It only took two rings before someone picked up. "Mandy."</p>
<p>"Richard, what the hell? The Chamber is about to convene a meeting."</p>
<p>Richard shook his head. "Look, you've got to talk to them. She's going to die."</p>
<p>"Richardâ€¦" Mandy sounded shocked, but he could tell she didn't completely believe him. "What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"I know what to do, Mandy. I'm not waiting anymore."</p>
<p>"<b>They </b>haven't figured out yet what to do, how can you possibly know?"</p>
<p>Richard looked at Miley. The girl's eyes had closed in the meantime, but her lips were moving. He couldn't hear what she was saying, but Richard knew. He just knew. "Miley told me. I've got to do this."</p>
<p>Mandy sighed, frustration showing through. "They won't be happy."</p>
<p>"They'll be fine. Come meet me at the site." Richard didn't leave Mandy time to ask questions. He hung up and tucked the phone back into his pocket.</p>
<p>He stood besides Miley, trying to gather his nerves as he watched her. Finally he took a deep breath and exhaled. "Come on, Miley, we're going on a trip."</p>
<p>Richard bent down and picked up the catatonic girl. Miley was dead weight, but did not protest nor fight as he draped her over his shoulder. He grabbed his keys and headed straight for the front door, hesitating only a second before he opened it.</p>
<p>The intense sunshine blinded him only momentarily. As soon as Richard stepped out onto the porch the sky darkened. Clouds appeared as if out of nowhere and he glanced at the sky. The dark front rolling in was almost enough to make him turn around. What if he was wrong about everything?</p>
<p>A sudden wind rustled the leaves of the trees surrounding the house. Thunder sounded in the distance, quickening the pace of Richard's heart. Then he heard Miley groan, the first sound she'd made in a long time, and he quickly made his way down the porch and towards his truck. Richard noticed the familiar SUV coming down the road towards the driveway and he cursed. Throwing his truck doors open he somehow managed to squeeze Miley into the backseat just as the first raindrops started to fall. He turned, ready to slam the doors shut, but Lilly was already running towards him.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you doing?" Lilly at first thought she was hallucinating when she'd seen Richard carrying Miley to his truck. There certainly could have been a host of good explanations, but her brain skipped past all of them and immediately settled on 'Richard is kidnapping my girlfriend'.</p>
<p>Richard was a great liar, he was smooth and calm under pressure, had those warm eyes and nice smile to get anyone to believe what he was saying, but in that moment he could think of nothing to say. He decided to ignore Lilly and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>"Hey, let Miley go!" Lilly reached him just in time to stop Richard from climbing into the truck. She knew it was stupid to attack a grown man who probably had twice her strength, but she wasn't thinking about anything but Miley. "Miley!"</p>
<p>Richard threw a glance into his backseat, but Miley still wasn't moving. He pulled away from Lilly's grip and turned on her. "Let go or I will hurt you."</p>
<p>The rain began to pick up, foreshadowing the arrival of the dark clouds. Lilly was terrified, for Miley, for herself, but she did not believe Richard would really hurt her. She yanked open the door to the backseat, revealing Miley curled up on the seat unmoving. "Miley can't be outside. She's going to die!"</p>
<p>The panic overwhelmed her and she reached for her girlfriend, even though she had no idea how she'd carry the girl back inside. A hand suddenly wrapped around her arm and pulled her back. Richard was much stronger than her and Lilly stood no chance no matter how hard she fought. He turned her to face him, his dark eyes boring into hers.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry, Lilly."</p>
<p><i>to be continued...</i></p>
<p>Richard reached out and brought his palm to her forehead. Before Lilly had a chance to react, she was enveloped by blackness.</p>
