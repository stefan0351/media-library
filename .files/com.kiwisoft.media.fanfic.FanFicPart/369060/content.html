<p>I'm glad you're all enjoying this story so much; I'm having a lot of fun writing it, too. Thanks to everyone who has reviewed, it means a lot to me. I'm fighting my way through finals week right now, so hopefully after next week I'll have some extra time to really get writing on this story. I'd like to update a little more often, but no promises...we'll see how it goes, and how motivating your reviews are ;)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter IV </b></p>
<p>Miley stared forlornly into her bowl, chin propped up on one hand. With the other hand she was flicking the spoon sticking out of her soup, the rhythmic clinking noise somehow soothing her. It was a lot less soothing to the other occupants at the table, however, and her mother finally smacked her hand, after countless requests to stop went unheard. Miley startled out of her reverie and looked up, finding three pairs of eyes scrutinizing her.</p>
<p>"Miley, stop playing around and eat your soup." Susan's voice was stern and serious. Miley didn't know when her mother had stopped just getting exasperated with her, instead of this sternness that was almost cold and unloving.</p>
<p>"I don't like the soup," said Miley softly, looking back down into the murky green liquid. To her it looked and smelled something like someone had scooped up the chicken poop in the barn and mixed it with pond water.</p>
<p>Susan sighed, frustrated. Miley had always been a headstrong and difficult child, but Richard's presence was taking her to new heights. "Either you eat your soup or you can go upstairs."</p>
<p>Miley wanted to explain that she really didn't like the soup, not just because Richard had made it, but her mother had given her an out she would gladly take. She pushed her chair out, but before she could even get up, her mother stopped her.</p>
<p>"Your cell phone," said Susan, holding out her hand. Miley looked at her with confusion written on her face. "You're not being rewarded for being difficult by getting to go upstairs and calling Lilly. Let me have your phone."</p>
<p>An awkward silence fell over the table while the other two adults watched the interaction. Richard, especially, had his eyes glued to Miley and she shifted under his intense stare. Miley tried hard to focus on her mother's face and not turn to look at him.</p>
<p>"I don't have it."</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>Miley moved again, wanting nothing more than to get away from Richard's stare. "I don't know, momma. I had it earlier and now I don't know."</p>
<p>Susan narrowed her eyes as she watched her daughter. Miley seemed nervous, more than just her regular hyperactivity. "Miley Ray, I swear if you are lying to meâ€¦"</p>
<p>Miley's stomach dropped and a sudden, overwhelming need to run as far away as she could and climb the highest tree in sight overtook her. A lump formed in her throat. "I don't lieâ€¦"</p>
<p>"Mileyâ€¦"</p>
<p>She didn't give her mother a chance to finish, instead getting up and rushing out of the dining room. Someone shouted after her to take her crutches, but Miley refused to be deterred from her escape. She made her way towards the stairs, circled around where she couldn't be seen and slipped out the back door. Each step jarred her legs, but she hardly felt the pain through the cloak of misery and anger hanging over her. Her mother, her one constant, the one person who had loved her and stuck by her through it all, had suddenly turned into this cold, distant and not at all loving person. And it was all Richard's fault.</p>
<p>The cold air burned her lungs as she sucked in deep breaths, but it felt good, clearing, somehow. Miley grasped the lowest branch of her favorite tree and with a small amount of effort pulled herself up. She kept climbing until she reached her favorite branch, a thick, long one with the perfect grove to allow her to sit comfortably against the trunk. There were no leaves on the tree now, but with the darkness Miley felt confident no one would be able to see her until sunrise. She leaned back and closed her eyes, ignoring the biting wind nipping at her and her cold, sock-clad feet, wet from the slight frost on the grass.</p>

<p>The only sounds in the kitchen were the occasional clanging of plates and cups as they silently cleared the table and cleaned up. Susan was lost deep in her thoughts, her inner turmoil clearly written on her face. Grandma Ruby was doing some dishes, while Susan put everything away and neither woman spoke while doing her task. It took several minutes before one of them broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Where is Richard?"</p>
<p>"He went outside to take a phone call," said Susan absentmindedly then stopped in the middle of carrying a bottle of Tabasco to the cupboard. "I just don't understand her behavior, mom."</p>
<p>Ruby turned, knowing full well whom Susan was talking about, but decided not to speak, just yet. Susan sighed heavily and set the bottle on the counter. "Miley's always beenâ€¦her own person, but she's never been downright rude like this. This town shunned her for years and she hardly seemed to care, but as soon as I bring a good man home, she turns into a brat."</p>
<p>Susan ran a hand through her hair in frustration, clearly still struggling with whatever turmoil she had inside. "It's been two years sinceâ€¦I justâ€¦I've finally found someone to be happy with again and I don't want to resent Miley for trying to ruin that."</p>
<p>"Oh, honey, I understand that, but Mileyâ€¦she lost her daddy and to her it's just not right to see you with another man. She doesn't want anyone to replace her daddy."</p>
<p>"Richard's not here to replace Robby Ray."</p>
<p>Ruby sighed, hating the difficult situation they were stuck in. "You and I know that, but Miley, all she has left is us and now Richard is taking you away from her."</p>
<p>Susan shook her head. "I haven't gone anywhere. And even before Richard, Miley spent most her time with Lilly. Should I be upset over that?"</p>
<p>Ruby gave her daughter an incredulous look that clearly said 'don't be stupid'. Susan sighed and turned away to put some things away in the fridge. "I know, I'm being ridiculous. I just wish I could figure out a way to make Miley happy without having to sacrifice my own happiness."</p>
<p>She stopped, staring at the open refrigerator for several moments, before she scoffed, reached inside and turned back to her mother. In her hand was a slightly dinged and scratched cell phone. Susan felt a sudden lump in her throat and shook her head to clear away the inevitable tears. "Miley's cell phone. I know she's never lied to meâ€¦I was justâ€¦so frustrated with her behavior lately that I said something I shouldn't have."</p>
<p>"Maybe you should talk to her," suggested Ruby, returning to her dishes.</p>
<p>Susan scoffed, though her voice was tinged with sadness. "I bet she's holed up in her room. It'll be mornin' before we catch sight of her."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>A voice startled Miley awake. She hadn't even realized she was dozing off, but as soon as she opened her eyes, the cold really hit her. She shivered, now regretting not stopping for shoes or a jacket, but she refused to go back inside. Lilly's thick UCLA hoodie was warm and comfortable and Miley wrapped her arms tightly around herself. It still smelled like Lilly and she smiled.</p>
<p>The voice came again, closer this time, and Miley shifted on her branch to try and look down. The porch light was on, casting shadows along its path, but whoever was talking was out of reach of the light. The voice kept coming closer and now it sounded like the person was standing almost directly under the tree. Miley strained to listen.</p>
<p>"â€¦no, I don't think you know what you're talking aboutâ€¦well, I disagreeâ€¦"</p>
<p>With a start Miley realized it was Richard, probably talking to someone on his phone. Excitement cursed through her as Miley hoped he would say something incriminating, some explanation for his odd behavior. Something she could use to get her mom and grandma and Lilly to finally believe her about him.</p>
<p>"â€¦look, John, this is not as cut and dry as you think it isâ€¦no, you're wrong in factâ€¦I <b>know</b> how important she is, yesâ€¦no, listen to me, you all chose <b>me</b> to do this, because you thought I was the best person for the job, so let me do this my wayâ€¦no, the mother has nothing to do with thisâ€¦"</p>
<p>Richard was silent for several moments, likely being yelled at by whoever was on the other end of the line. Miley pushed herself farther back on the branch, her hands suddenly shaking. The branch creaked under her weight.</p>
<p>"â€¦she is fineâ€¦how about you just do what I asked and let me worry about the girl? I gotta go now. Bye John." Richard flipped his phone shut audibly and Miley held her breath, as if he could hear or see her up high in the tree. "You know, Miley, it's not very nice to listen in on other people's conversations."</p>
<p>A cold chill settled inside of Miley, a panic she hadn't felt in a long time. Somehow she just knew Richard had been talking about her. She thought about just remaining silent, pretending like she wasn't there, but somehow she knew Richard would know regardless. She took a deep breath to try and steady her voice. "Well, I was here first, so it was you who interrupted my solitude."</p>
<p>Richard chuckled, his aloofness irking Miley further. "You're right, Miley. I'm sorry." He was silent for several minutes and Miley almost thought he'd left, when he spoke again. "It's pretty cold out here; maybe you should come inside."</p>
<p>"I think I'll just stay," said Miley, the tree providing her with a sense of security.</p>
<p>"I'm sure your mom would like it if you came inside."</p>
<p>Miley frowned at the mention of the mother whom she felt so betrayed by. Sure, she was cold and hungry, but she'd stay out here all night if the alternative was to make nice with Richard to get back in her mom's good graces. So she said nothing, hoping Richard would take the hint and leave. He did not.</p>
<p>"Alright, Miley, you leave me no choice."</p>
<p>Miley wondered briefly whether he would set the tree on fire or cut it down to force her off, but instead she heard his footsteps retreat across the frozen grass and onto the porch. The front door opened and closed and a few minutes passed before it opened again. Miley craned her neck to look at the house and knew as soon as she saw her mother standing on the porch beside Richard she was in trouble, again.</p>
<p>"Miley, off the tree <b>now</b>." Susan had barely come to a realization about Miley's behavior, when the girl did something else absolutely infuriating. She had no idea how they hadn't heard Miley leave the house.</p>
<p>Perhaps she could stay in the tree forever, Miley wondered, not keen on facing her angry mother. She was already in trouble anyway, what more could possibly happen? And what about creepy Richard down there, waiting for her, to do <b>something</b> to her just as he'd discussed with his buddy on the phone. Miley remained silent, not moving on her branch in the tree.</p>
<p>Despite Richard's calm voice telling her to go easy on the girl, Susan had a hard time trying to keep her anger at bay. Miley had always been reckless and exhausting, but she'd always listened when things got serious. Now she wasn't even moving an inch. Susan knew she had to bring out the big guns. "Alright, have it your way. Right now, no seeing or talking to Lilly for a week. And if you don't come down in the next five seconds, I will extend that to a month."</p>
<p>The thought of not getting to see her girlfriend formed a heavy clump of despair in Miley's heart. The realization her mother suddenly seemed to hate her only expanded the clump, growing it until it sat so heavily in Miley's insides she thought the branch under her would surely break and send her crashing to the earth underneath. She didn't want to come down, didn't want to be near Richard who couldn't be trusted and didn't want to face her mom who didn't believe her.</p>
<p>It was the slow counting that broke her out of her gloom and no matter how much she wanted to fight against it, Miley knew she was going to come down. Her mother reached four, however, before Miley moved. Her arms and legs were stiff from the cold and she could hardly clamp her hands around the branch as she lowered herself down. Without leaves the bare tree hardly offered a challenge as she descended and in no time Miley stood underneath it, dreading her return to the house. Her hands shook from the cold, but at least her legs were too numb to feel any pain as she walked towards the porch.</p>
<p>"Richard, can you help her please?" Susan motioned at Miley, who was without crutches and clearly half-popsicle.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Miley ground out and she sounded so unlike herself it hurt Susan to hear. Miley didn't want Richard anywhere near her. She just wanted her mom to help her, to wrap her arms around Miley and reassure her until everything was okay again. Miley almost wanted to cry, but she never cried and the last time she did had been with Lilly in that tree and the mere thought of her girlfriend nearly made the tears spill over.</p>
<p>Susan watched Miley stalk past her and into the house without an ounce of exuberance, mischief or excitement in her. She couldn't remember a time when Miley didn't at least have a sparkle in her eyes or a grin waiting to burst forth, even when being grounded or scolded. She had no idea what to do.</p>
<p>"Miley, go and take a hot shower, you're frozen solid, hun. When you're done, come downstairs and I will get you some food," said Susan, her voice no longer angry. How could she be when she was looking at the pure misery that was her daughter at that moment? She even tried to brush a hand across the top of Miley's head, but the girl was already moving away from her and up the stairs.</p>
<p>It was nearly two hours later when Susan realized she'd been sitting in an empty kitchen for a while, waiting with an untouched Tobasco-and-cheese sandwich.</p>
