<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 21 -->

<p>Jane shifted the laundry basket she was carrying, shifting the weight of it
so that it rested on her hip freeing up one of her hands.  Opening the door
she quickly pushed her way inside and flipped the light on.  Looking around
the room she shook her head, the place was an absolute mess.  Of all of her
daughters wonderful qualities keeping an orderly room was not one of them.</p>

<p>Shifting the basket once again she made her way over to Sam's bed
unceremoniously dropping the laundry basket onto the mattress.  She then
spun around and surveyed the room once again.  As long as she was there it
couldn't hurt to tidy the place up a bit, she thought to herself, her eyes
focusing on the natural disaster that for at least two days out of the month
served as Sam's desk.</p>

<p>Making her way over to the offending object she sighed deeply wondering
where to begin.  Taking another step forward, she failed to notice a book
lying on the floor in front of her and tripped over it, knocking into the
desk which sent a myriad of papers and books plummeting to the ground.
Regaining her balance she looked at the damage she had done, an ironic smile
crossing her face.  At least now she knew where to begin.</p>

<p>Bending down she began to pick up the scattered objects placing them into
drawers or onto the bookshelf in an orderly fashion, then she turned her
attention to the rest of the desk doing the same with the objects resting on
it.  Finishing up with that she took a step back to survey her handy work,
and pleased with the results was about to turn around when she noticed one
book partially hidden under the desk.</p>

<p>Reaching out for it she noticed something sticking out of it's side, but
paid no attention to whatever it was until it fell out of the book as she
picked it up.  It had fallen so that the back of it was facing up, so all
that she could tell immediately was that it was a pamphlet of some kind.
Shrugging her shoulders she reached down and picked it up, opening the cover
of the book to replace it when she caught sight of the front of it.  What
she say almost made her drop it again.</p>

<p>"Same sex equals safe sex, a guide to safe sexual relations for the other
ten per cent," Jane read out loud.  She could read the words, individually
she understood them, but she just couldn't seem to wrap her mind around what
she was seeing.</p>

<p>Placing the book down on top of the desk with a shaky hand, Jane opened up
the pamphlet.  It was certainly a guide, she thought to herself as she
flipped through the pages.  A sensitive, yet informative guide for teenagers
engaged in homosexual relationships.  She closed the pamphlet and placed it
in the book lying it back on the ground where she had spotted it lying only
moments before, then she took a step back from the desk.</p>

<p>The primary question that kept running through her mind was 'why did Sam
have a pamphlet that was basically a manual for gay relationships?'.  It was
a question that she could only come up with a few answers to, two of which
she found particularly startling.  The first option, the one she favored
although honesty didn't believe, was that it was research for an article Sam
was writing.  Sam was a budding journalist, it was possible, but the way in
which she found it went against her daughters modus operendi regarding her
work.  Despite the state that her room was often in, Jane had noticed that
Sam kept meticulous notes on whatever she was writing about at a given time,
titled file folders which held various articles and notes on the subject for
one.  This wasn't like that at all.  Not once had Jane seen Sam just shove
something she was working on into a book and leave it on the floor.</p>

<p>This then brought her to her next option, which surprised but didn't quite
alarm her.  That was that Sam was curious about same sex relationships.
Teenagers were often curious, that was their job after all,  to learn.  She
was curious and she had sought out information, that was a very responsible,
very Sam thing to do, Jane thought to herself.  This option was very
plausible, and to Jane much, much, much more acceptable than option number
three, which was that Sam was already engaged in a gay relationship and
wanted to know how to go about hitting a homerun.  This thought distressed
Jane greatly.  Her baby was too young to be engaging in acts not even the
Kama Sutra explored.  Plus, she didn't even want to consider who the girl
was that had deflowered her daughter.  No, she wasn't going to consider that
at the moment, she couldn't consider that a moment.  What she had to do was
sit down.  Yes, she was going to go sit down and then once she calmed down
she was going to consider things rationally.</p>

<p>What she did however was make her way down stairs and fix herself a rum and
coke.</p>
