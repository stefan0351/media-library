<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Nine -->

<p>After landing at the airport, Brooke drove the rental car through Telluride, showing Sam the town. Brooke had a pretty good idea where things were even though it'd been years since she'd last visited her uncle. She pointed out some sights, watching as Sam's entire face lit up like she was that seven year old little girl again, finally having a dream come true. It made Brooke feel unbelievably good to know that she was bringing Sam such immense happiness. Even more so knowing how precious Sam's memories of her father were and getting the chance to fulfill a promise that he had made to her.</p>
<p>It took them forty more minutes to drive all the way from Telluride to the cabin; it was so off the beaten path. But Sam was instantly taken with it. It was a large two story home, built using the rustic look of logs. A large deck circled the entire thing and it overlooked a breathtaking vista of the mountains on one side. Although town was under an hour away by car, Sam felt like she was at the edge of the world, and loved it.</p>
<p>"God, Brooke, it's beautiful," she gasped as she exited the car. She took a deep breath, letting the cold snowy air fill her lungs and make her shiver slightly. The air was so clear and crisp, drastically different from the smog and haze from LA and Sam took several minutes to breathe it in, just enjoying it.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you like it, Sam," Brooke smiled, watching as Sam closed her eyes and breathed deeply. The brunette looked so contented and happy that Brooke almost laughed. They'd only just arrived and yet she couldn't remember ever seeing such joy on Sam's face. She was almost glowing.</p>
<p>&lt;Not as beautiful as you are right now, though Sam&gt; she thought silently. Sam's eyes opened again and focused on Brooke.</p>
<p>"Have I thanked you enough for this trip?" she asked with a grin. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"Wait and see if you have a good time or not, Sam. THEN thank me," she answered. Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"I'm sure we're going to have a great time, Brooke. How can we not?" she said, coming back over to the car to start unpacking. "Fresh air, snow, skiing, a roaring fireplace..."</p>
<p>"Hot chocolate," Brooke added.</p>
<p>"Hot tubs," Sam mentioned. Brooke's eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>"Hmm, sounds good," she mumbled as the image of Sam in a bathing suit and hot tub played in her mind.</p>
<p>"And terrific company. Face it, Brooke. We're doomed to a fabulous vacation," Sam smirked as she lifted a suitcase. "And who would have thought? You and me on a mountain getaway?" She stopped and turned to Brooke, her face suddenly serious.</p>
<p>"And, by the way, I really am glad it's you that came with me, Brooke," she said quietly. "I miss spending time with you." Brooke blushed and nodded.</p>
<p>"Me too, Sam. This is a great opportunity to catch up," she said. </p>
<p>&lt;And maybe I can get you to look at me in the same light you do Nicole&gt;</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>If Sam was in love with the outside of the cabin, she was in serious lust with the inside. Open and airy, the cabin was breathtaking. It had the look of an old log cabin but with all the technological advances to make it comfortable. Two bathrooms, one hot tub on the ground floor encased in a glass porch, 5 bedrooms, a huge living room and a fully stocked kitchen. She walked around the cabin in a state of awe.</p>
<p>"Jeeze, and I thought the outside was gorgeous," she breathed. "Your uncle spared no expense, huh?" Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"I guess not. But there's no phone, just a CB radio. He likes to be comfortable but hates the whole, 'cell phone, fax, computer, modem' thing," she said. "So if we need to contact anyone, we just have to fire the thing up and call out. Don't worry, I know how to use it."</p>
<p>"Hmm, hidden talents, huh McQueen?" Sam teased lightly as she continued to walk around. Brooke couldn't help the slight blush she felt rise to her cheeks at Sam's question. She figured Sam meant it innocently enough but a certain hidden meaning immediately sprang to mind.</p>
<p>&lt;Eh, what the Hell? Let's see if she's in a flirty mood&gt; Brooke decided. &lt;Gotta start somewhere and I only have a week to try and get her to look at me as someone other than a friend&gt;</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to know?" she shot back, carefully gauging Sam's reaction. Sam turned to face her and arched an eyebrow, a slight smirk crossing her face.</p>
<p>"Oh really? We're in a mood today," she taunted. "And what if I WANT to know?" Sam joked back, watching, as Brooke blushed redder.</p>
<p>"Ugh..." &lt;Damn, didn't think she'd take the bait so early&gt; Brooke panicked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I THOUGHT so," Sam laughed. She walked up closer to Brooke, nearly brushing shoulders with the slightly taller blonde. </p>
<p>"Careful who you tease, Brooke," she warned in a low but pleasant tone. "Unless you can take what you dish out." And with that, she went back to the car for more bags, leaving Brooke mildly panicked in the kitchen of the cabin.</p>
<p>&lt;Shit! I wasn't expecting her to play back&gt; Brooke thought. &lt;I wasn't ready! Damn it, damn it! Lost a perfect opportunity there because I wasn't ready. Well, at least I know she's willing to at least joke around with me&gt;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sam was shaking her head and wondering what was wrong with her.</p>
<p>&lt;What the Hell am I doing? Brooke's straight and was just playing but damn, my mind is SO in the gutter that I wanted her to be implying more. I'm lucky she didn't rip into me for that little comment. I hope she's not mad. That'll make this whole vacation totally blow&gt;</p>
<p>She walked back into the house and found Brooke still standing where she left her.</p>
<p>"Are you gone help me, Princess? Or am I your slave?" she teased, testing Brooke for a reaction. Brooke blinked rapidly at her for a second and then smiled.</p>
<p>"You're not my slave, Sammy," she said heading out to the car. "Unless you're into that sort thing," she called back. Sam's eyes got wide.</p>
<p>"Ha...?"</p>
<p>&lt;I think the change in altitude is affecting my brain because I could SWEAR Brooke's flirting with me&gt; Sam shook her head. &lt;And I KNOW that can't be right&gt;</p>
<p>She was still standing there confused when a snowball came sailing in and hit her in the chest. She looked back up at Brooke who was standing outside the door trying to look innocent.</p>
<p>"Now who's napping? Wakey wakey," she mocked Sam. Sam's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"Oh you are in SO much trouble!" she threatened before taking off chasing Brooke. Brooke let out a yelp and starting running. She managed to avoid Sam for several tense minutes as the brunette chased her but eventually, Sam tackled her into the snow.</p>
<p>"Gotcha!" Sam declared. Brooke giggled and squirmed trying to get away.</p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going, blondie? I owe you," Sam informed her. Brooke stopped squirming and watched in horror as Sam grabbed a fistful of snow, pulled open the front of her jacket and shoved it down.</p>
<p>"SAAAAAAAAAAM!" she shrieked as the cold snow hit her warm skin. "GOD that's cold!" she complained breathless.</p>
<p>"Serves you right," Sam teased. "I thought you needed cooling off anyway," she laughed, sitting back on her haunches, still slightly straddling Brooke. Brooke looked up at her and pretended to pout.</p>
<p>"Cheat," she accused. Sam frowned.</p>
<p>"How's that? I caught you fair and square."</p>
<p>"I let you catch me," Brooke taunted cheekily. Sam's jaw opened wide.</p>
<p>"Oh you did, did you?" Brooke nodded. "Well, we'll have to see about that." She stood up and offered her hand to Brooke, pulling her to her feet. Brooke shook out the last of the snow from her shirt.</p>
<p>"Oh that was mean," she said to Sam as she shivered. Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke, THIS is mean," she pulled the waistband of Brooke's jeans out a bit and poured the hidden handful of snow down the gap. Brooke jumped, screamed and twisted away as Sam collapsed laughing. After recovering from her frozen shock, Brooke glared at the hysterical brunette.</p>
<p>"I'll get you for that," she growled. Sam wiped away the laughter-induced tears and nodded.</p>
<p>"Come and get me," she said saucily. "I look forward to it."</p>
