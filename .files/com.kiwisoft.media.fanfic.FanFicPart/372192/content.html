<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER TEN</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">DESTINY</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">-Three Years Later-</p>
<p>Three years had passed since Susan Stewart's tragic death, and the family she'd left behind was finally beginning to put their lives back together. Miley and Lilly, both fifteen, were attending Pine Ridge High School as sophomores. They were still as close as ever, which had led to some of their crueler classmates spreading rumors about them, but they could've cared less; their bond of friendship remained unbreakable.</p>
<p>As the bell rang, signaling the end of another school day, Lilly rushed over to Miley, who was gathering a few things from her locker.</p>
<p>"Miles!" she cried out excitedly.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lils," Miley greeted her happily. "How was geometry class?"</p>
<p>"You don't wanna know," Lilly muttered. "I'm really gonna need your help later."</p>
<p>"As long as you help me with my history homework," Miley replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Don't I always?" Lilly quipped. "Study night at your place?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good," Miley told her. "So what were you so excited about, Lils?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah!" Lilly said, remembering at last. "I had a great idea!" Miley knew from long experience that Lilly's 'great ideas' were not always so – especially once she'd had a few minutes to really think about them – but she was always willing to listen to her best friend anyway.</p>
<p>"What idea?" Miley asked her, still smiling.</p>
<p>"You know the Harvest Festival is coming up, right?" Lilly asked her. Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"Now, I know you haven't wanted to go the last couple of years… because of your mom… and I understand," Lilly continued in a gentle voice. She was always very careful when she talked about Miley's late mother, knowing how much Miley still felt her loss.</p>
<p>"It's all right, Lilly," Miley responded. "I'm really looking forward to going with you this year, honest." Lilly couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"Me, too," she said happily. "Did you hear about the talent contest they're gonna have?"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah," Miley answered. "Uncle Earl's already talking about getting his guitar ready!" She laughed, and Lilly laughed with her. She had only met Uncle Earl once, at a family Thanksgiving two years ago, but she knew all about his outrageous dream of being a rock star.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway," Lilly managed, still trying to recover from her laughing fit, "I thought maybe <i>you</i> could enter the contest, Miley." Miley abruptly stopped what she was doing and turned to look at her best friend.</p>
<p>"Lilly…" she began.</p>
<p>"Miles, honestly, you have an amazing voice! You shouldn't be afraid to share it with other people…" Lilly said quietly.</p>
<p>"I don't know, Lils," Miley whispered. "Singing for you is one thing. Singing in front of a whole crowd of people I don't know is something else."</p>
<p>"Promise me you'll at least think about it?" Lilly pressed, her trademark grin appearing on her face once more.</p>
<p>"All right, I promise," Miley replied, smiling again as well. "Now we'd better get home. We've got a ton of studying to do!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Robbie Ray Stewart stood on the front porch of his home, staring out across the expansive orange grove that now occupied much of his land. Most of the fruit he grew he had contracted to sell to big companies like Sunkist, earning him the money to provide for his family. The rest he sold at local farmers markets or he and his family just simply ate. It was not an easy way to earn a living, but he was willing to do whatever it took to take care of his children.</p>
<p>Being a single father was proving to be the single greatest challenge of Robbie Ray's life, but he had vowed a long time ago that he would never give up, no matter what.</p>
<p>"I hope I'm doing all this right, Susie," he whispered to his departed wife, casting a brief glance skyward. "There are times I wonder how you managed it all, baby." At the far end of the driveway leading to his property, Robbie Ray saw the familiar school bus arrive, and a few moments his daughter Miley and her best friend Lilly appeared outside it. The bus roared away and the two friends slowly made their way up the driveway, talking amongst themselves.</p>
<p>"Hi daddy!" Miley greeted him as they neared the house.</p>
<p>"Hey bud," Robbie Ray greeted her, smiling warmly. "How was school?"</p>
<p>"Same as always, Mr. S," Lilly quipped. "Brutal!" Robbie Ray chuckled.</p>
<p>"Guess that means you two have a bunch of homework then," he said.</p>
<p>"Don't we always?" Miley responded.</p>
<p>"Well, sounds like you better get started then," Robbie Ray replied. "I left some snacks on the kitchen table for you." Miley stepped up onto the porch and hugged her father warmly.</p>
<p>"You're the best, you know that?" she asked him softly.</p>
<p>"It's a burden I've learned to live with," Robbie Ray joked, hugging her back. They parted, and Lilly gave him a quick hug as well.</p>
<p>"You know, you don't <i>always</i> have to wait on the porch for us when we come home from school," Lilly teased him. "I'm sure Miley and I can find the house without help!"</p>
<p>"Now what kinda daddy would I be if I didn't make sure my girls got home safe and sound?" Robbie Ray replied, smiling. "Now get in there and start your homework, silly. Tell Miley and Jackson I'll be in to start dinner after I give the south forty a once-over." Lilly nodded.</p>
<p>"Will do, Mr. S… and thanks."</p>
<p>"For what?" he asked as he climbed off the porch.</p>
<p>"For always taking care of us," Lilly said with a smile. She gave a little wave and then hurried into the house. Miley was already waiting for her at the kitchen table, where Robbie Ray had left them a plate of carrot & celery sticks with a little ranch dressing. Lilly wasted no time in helping herself to a few.</p>
<p>"Man, it's a good thing I don't live here," Lilly quipped around a mouthful. "As good as your dad feeds us, I'd get so <i>fat</i>!"</p>
<p>"You practically <i>do</i> live here, silly," Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"By the way, he said he'd be in to start dinner after he checked out the south forty," Lilly reported. Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"Same old daddy," she said with a smile. "So, what should we do first… geometry or history?"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Later, after their homework and dinner was done, Miley and Lilly relaxed and watched a little television while waiting for Lilly to be picked up by her mom.</p>
<p>"Thanks again for helping me with my geometry homework," Lilly said, snuggling against her best friend</p>
<p>"My pleasure, Lils," Miley said with a smile. "Math I can do, but for some reason, I stink at history!"</p>
<p>"Guess we make a pretty good team then, huh?" Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"That we do," Miley agreed happily. They were silent for a long moment, just enjoying each other's company.</p>
<p>"So… did you think some more about the talent contest?" Lilly asked carefully. Miley shook her head and laughed.</p>
<p>"You don't give up, do you Lils?" she responded. "Does it really mean that much to you?"</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna <i>make</i> you perform Miles, I just think you'd be awesome," Lilly responded. "Heck, I'll even help you if you want."</p>
<p>"Help me how?" Miley asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Well, I could help you decide what song to sing, I guess… oh, and I could introduce you!" Lilly gushed excitedly. Miley giggled at her best friend's enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Actually, if I'm gonna do this, I think I'd like to sing one of the songs I wrote for my mom,"</p>
<p>"Oh," Lilly said softly. "I'm sorry Miles, I didn't mean to…"</p>
<p>"It's okay Lilly, really. You don't have to be afraid to talk about momma," Miley told her gently. "I still miss her, you know that, but I'm not gonna break if you say her name." Lilly swallowed.</p>
<p>"I know, Miley… I just didn't want to say something wrong."</p>
<p>"Always trying to protect me, aren't you?" Miley said with a smile.</p>
<p>"You're my best friend, it's my job," Lilly said softly, smiling back. Impulsively, Miley wrapped her arms around Lilly and pulled her into a gentle hug.</p>
<p>"I love you too," she whispered happily. For a brief moment, Lilly felt her heart begin to beat faster, a familiar rush of adrenaline she knew well, but she fought it back down.</p>
<p>She'd felt it before, in moments of closeness with Miley, but she'd never quite understood it. Actually, that wasn't entirely true. Lilly had a very good idea what those feelings meant – she'd been having them ever since that fateful day at Miley's mamaw's, back when they were both twelve – but she'd been denying it for the last three years. Whatever she might be feeling, Lilly was convinced Miley could never feel the same way in return, and so she buried those feelings way down deep, where they couldn't hurt her.</p>
<p>"You okay Lilly?" Miley asked her softly. "You're kinda quiet…"</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Lilly responded, finding her voice again. "I love you too, Miley." They stayed in each other's embrace for a few long moments, then Miley gently pulled away.</p>
<p>"So, if I get up there and sing, you gonna be there with me?" she asked Lilly with a smile. "I'm probably not gonna have much of a cheering section…"</p>
<p>"You'll have me," Lilly promised. "I'll cheer so loud the whole fair will hear me!" Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"I'll hold you to that," she warned playfully. "All right, Lils… I'll do it; for you."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>The Harvest Fair was a few days later, and Lilly and Miley spent most of it on the midway, riding rides, playing a few games, and just enjoying each other's company.</p>
<p>"Are you nervous about later?" Lilly asked Miley as they took a brief rest near the food booths.</p>
<p>"A little," Miley admitted. "I think I'll be okay though… as long as you're with me."</p>
<p>"I'll be right there with you," Lilly promised. "Don't worry." Her eyes gleamed mischievously, and without warning she suddenly dropped an ice cube from her soda down the back of Miley's shirt. Miley shrieked and jumped back.</p>
<p>"What the heck was that for?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"You looked like you needed a little cooling down," Lilly joked. Her innocent expression cracked and she doubled over with laughter.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're gonna get it for that, Truscott!" Miley laughed. She managed to fish the ice cube out of her shirt and, before Lilly could stop her, deftly slipped it down Lilly's shirt instead. Lilly jumped up and tried to pull it out, but Miley grabbed her in a hug, pinning her arms at her sides.</p>
<p>"That's not fair, Miley!" Lilly whined, squirming in Miley's embrace. "Miley come on, it's <i>melting</i>!"</p>
<p>"Say uncle?" Miley teased her, arching an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"All right, all right, uncle!" Lilly pleaded. Laughing, Miley released Lilly from her embrace. Lilly wasted no time in freeing what was left of the ice cub from her now slightly damp t-shirt.</p>
<p>"You don't play fair," she complained playfully, sticking out her tongue at Miley.</p>
<p>"Never mess with a Stewart woman," Miley quipped, grinning widely.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A little while later, as sunset neared and lights began coming on all over the fairgrounds, the contestants began lining up for the Harvest Festival's First Annual Talent Contest. A large stage had been built near the fair entrance, and rows of bleacher seats had been set up for the anticipated audience. The contestants themselves – six in all, including Miley and her Uncle Earl – were lined up near the side of the stage, waiting for their names to be called. Miley was last, and had to wait and watch everyone else perform before her. There were no judges for the contest; instead, the applause of the crowd would determine the best act.</p>
<p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Miley heard her name called and nervously climbed up onto the stage. A loud whistle caught her attention and she turned her head to see Lilly sitting front row center in the stands, waving her hands excitedly.</p>
<p>"Go get 'em, Miles!" she cried out. Miley waved back, laughing and fighting back the urge to blush.</p>
<p>"For our final act, please welcome Miss Miley Stewart!" the announcer called out. "She's going to share with us her incredible singing voice!" Nervously adjusting the microphone in front of her, Miley paused to take a deep breath and whispered a short prayer. Then she calmly took the microphone in her hand and began to speak.</p>
<p>"Hi everyone," she said softly. "This is a song I wrote for my momma, who I love and miss very much. I hope you all like it." With that, Miley closed her eyes and began to sing…</p>
<p><i>You used to call me your angel</i></p>
<p><i>Said I was sent straight down from Heaven</i></p>
<p><i>You'd hold me close in your arms</i></p>
<p><i>I loved the way you felt so strong</i></p>
<p><i>I never wanted you to leave</i></p>
<p><i>I wanted you to stay here holding me</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>I miss your smile</i></p>
<p><i>And I still shed a tear</i></p>
<p><i>Every once in a while</i></p>
<p><i>And even though it's different now</i></p>
<p><i>You're still here somehow</i></p>
<p><i>My heart won't let you go</i></p>
<p><i>And I need you to know</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>Sha-la-la-la-la</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>You used to call me your dreamer</i></p>
<p><i>And now I'm living out my dreams</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, how I wish you could see</i></p>
<p><i>Everything that's happening for me</i></p>
<p><i>I'm thinking back on the past</i></p>
<p><i>It's true that time is flying by too fast</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>I miss your smile</i></p>
<p><i>And I still shed a tear</i></p>
<p><i>Every once in a while</i></p>
<p><i>And even though it's different now</i></p>
<p><i>You're still here somehow</i></p>
<p><i>My heart won't let you go</i></p>
<p><i>And I need you to know</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>Sha-la-la-la-la</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>I know you're in a better place</i></p>
<p><i>But I wish I could see your face</i></p>
<p><i>I know you're where you need to be</i></p>
<p><i>Even though it's not here with me</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>I miss your smile</i></p>
<p><i>And I still shed a tear</i></p>
<p><i>Every once in a while</i></p>
<p><i>And even though it's different now</i></p>
<p><i>You're still here somehow</i></p>
<p><i>My heart won't let you go</i></p>
<p><i>And I need you to know</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>I miss your smile</i></p>
<p><i>And I still shed a tear</i></p>
<p><i>Every once in a while</i></p>
<p><i>And even though it's different now</i></p>
<p><i>You're still here somehow</i></p>
<p><i>My heart won't let you go</i></p>
<p><i>And I need you to know</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you</i></p>
<p><i>Sha-la-la-la-la</i></p>
<p><i>I miss you…</i></p>
<p>Miley opened her eyes again as she finished the song, her heart hammering in her chest. For a long moment, only silence greeted her. Then, led by Lilly, the crowd erupted into enthusiastic applause, cheers and whistles.</p>
<p>"I think that says it all, ladies and gentlemen!" the announcer shouted above the roar of the crowd. "That performance was just incredible! Without further ado, I present to you our winner – the one and only Miss Miley Stewart!" As the crowd continued to applaud, the announcer walked on stage and presented Miley with a small golden trophy in the shape of a bullhorn. Moments later, Lilly bounded up onto the stage as well and enveloped Miley in a huge hug. Robbie Ray was right behind her, followed by Jackson.</p>
<p>"That was awesome, Miles! I knew you could do it!" Lilly shouted happily</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lilly," Miley whispered, brushing away her tears.</p>
<p>"Hey, you okay?" Lilly asked, concern creeping into her voice. Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"I'm fine… I just don't believe all this is happening!"</p>
<p>"I'm proud of you, bud," Robbie Ray congratulated her, stepping forward to hug his daughter as well. "Your momma would be too."</p>
<p>"That was pretty cool, Miles," Jackson added. "Hey, you think more girls will go out with me now that I have a famous sister?" Miley and Lilly giggled together.</p>
<p>"Dream on, big brother," Miley teased him.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" another voice called out. Everyone turned to see a middle-aged man standing on the steps leading to the stage. He had short brown hair, partially covered by a cowboy hat, and wore glasses.</p>
<p>"Forgive my intrusion," he apologized. "My name is Eddie Lebeck, and I just want to say how impressed I was by your incredible performance Miss Stewart. If you're interested, I may have an offer for you."</p>
<p>"What kind of offer?" Robbie Ray asked cautiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry," the man replied. He reached into his pocket. "My card… I'm a talent agent working for Hollywood Records. After what I just heard, I think you may have a future in the music business, Miss Stewart."</p>
