<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 28 -->

<p>The next morning, Xander and David were going over their part in the
plan for the War Of The Six. Giles, Willow, and the Slayers Council were
working together on the magic aspect of the war while Buffy was helping the
Slayers Council set it self up in a way that was best for Slayers.</p>

<p>Giles was returning in the afternoon from LA, having picked up some
needed supplies from a rare magic shop. Xander and David were siting in the
library while Buffy and Willow had disappeared about an hour ago in the gym.
David had finished showing Xander his plan for the battle.</p>

<p>"Interesting." Xander said thoughtfully. "But I think there is a
better way."</p>

<p>"What? How? Show me." David said, a little taken back. Xander had good
military training, thanks to his Halloween costume, but David wasn't sure
that it covered battle planning or strategy.</p>

<p>"OK. This is an idea. First... " Xander laid out his own plan. David
listened then tried to find some fatal flaw in Xander's plan. There was none.</p>

<p>"Xander, you are a dead set genius. How did you come up with this? Why
didn't I think of this?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Different training, different experience. Your army are masters at
small unit, hard hitting, mobile warfare. No one does it better. But this
situation calls for massive fire power and brute force. And nobody does it
better than Uncle Sam." Xander explained to an impressed David.</p>

<p>"OK Stormin' Norman, I'll arrange to get the gear that you need for
this dog and pony show of yours. What exactly do you need?"</p>

<p>"First, I'll need as many H&K GMG 2000's as you can get your hands on.
Next I'll... " Xander's voice trailed off as he started to look strange. He
shuddered, and rolled his eyes. David looked at Xander, worried.</p>

<p>"Mate, what's wrong?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Oh God! Nothing. Nothing is wrong at all. Oh boy!" Xander said
strangely and then moaned. It wasn't a moan of pain, it was a moan of sheer
pleasure. David wondered for a bit. Sure, battle planning and discussion of
tactics gave him intellectual pleasure but wasn't something give a man a full
blown happy, which was exactly what was happening to Xander right before his
eyes. It took a moment for David to realise what was happening.</p>

<p>Since they became Trinity, Xander, Buffy, and Willow had displayed an
empathetic connection. They could sense each others moods and feelings, even
when separated. The reason for Xander's current behaviour was probably due to
the activities of Buffy and Willow. David rolled his eyes in frustration.</p>

<p>"BUFFY! WILLOW! CAN YOU PLEASE CUT THAT SHIT OUT! I'M TRYING TO TALK
TO XANDER DOWN HERE!" David yelled at the top of his lungs. Xander continued
to writhe in happiness.</p>

<p>"I SAID CUT THAT SHIT OUT! I'M TRYING TO TALK TO XANDER!" David
bellowed in frustration. Nothing. It was getting down right uncomfortable
watching Xander.</p>

<p>"ALL RIGHT, YOU ASKED FOR IT!" David yelled then went over to Xander
and kicked him in the shin.</p>

<p>"OW!!" Xander yelped and grabbed his leg. Faintly, David heard a
similar cry of pain come from the two girls. Xander looked at David in
annoyance. David merely shrugged.</p>

<p>"Sorry about that mate, but I did ask them to stop."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Their days were spent in preparation for the War Of The Six. The last
few days before the war, David and Xander spent their time preparing their
position on the hill top in accordance with Xander's plan. The morning of the
war Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles and David surveyed the battle field.</p>

<p>Willow and Giles had gone to the battle field earlier to try and
determine exactly where Murg Dor and his vampire army would appear. Together
they had discovered a front of mystical energy which they believed to be
where Murg Dor would come from. Using this information, Xander was able to
orientate his battle plan.</p>

<p>The land around the hill was cleared for almost a mile, providing a
clear field of fire. Belts of Claymore mines and thermite mines were set up,
ready to decimate the vampires. </p>

<p>Near the top of the hill four pits had been dug and a H & K GMG 2000
had been emplaced in each. The H&K GMG (or Grenade Machine Gun) fired 40mm
incendiary grenades designed to burst in the air and toast any thing with in
2 or 3 yards. They were fitted with an experimental automatic target finder
and were autonomous. Capable of firing at 350 rounds a minute, they had
enough ammunition to last out the eclipse.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill a pit had been dug and this was where they
would fight from. Several MAG 58 machine guns with Match Head rounds were
there for personal use by the group. Willow and Giles were their magic team.
Together they would detect any spell that Murg Dor cast and then counter it.
They also had quite a number of other spells provided from the Slayers
Council to use on Murg Dor and the vampire army.</p>

<p>Should any vampire get into the pit where Buffy and the rest of them
were, then the next defensive measure would be activated. It consisted of a
sprinkler system which sprayed Holy Water in the pit. Everyone had crosses
and stakes as a last ditch measure.</p>

<p>The idea was not to wipe out the vampire army, it was rather to slow
them down long enough for the eclipse to end and the sun to reappear. The sun
would turn the vampires to ashes and Murg Dor would lose. The critical thing
was that as the Chosen One, Buffy needed to survive until the sun came out
from behind the moon. Everything else was not important, including Buffy's
friends.</p>

<p>They all stood in the pit, surveying the surrounding land. Each was in
quiet contemplation of the up coming battle. Buffy looked at her watch in
anger and then rounded on David.</p>

<p>"OK, Captain Kangaroo. It's only a few minutes before this eclipse
starts and there is no sign of your friend, you know, number six? As in the
sixth person to make up this War Of The Six. There are only 5 people here."
she said accusingly at David. David had a calm, almost resigned look on his
face. Perhaps there was even a hint of sadness.</p>

<p>"They are here. We have our six." he said.</p>

<p>"WHERE? HAVE YOU BROUGHT SOME INVISIBLE MAN? YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT!"
Buffy screamed at David.</p>

<p>"You want to know who the sixth person is? Fine! Six people are to
fight an army of vampires to save the world. A Chosen One and five others to
protect her. Well, you as the Chosen One, Buffy, have 5 people to protect
you. Xander, me, Dad, Willow and..." David paused for a moment. "... and
Willow's unborn child." Everyone stood looking at David in stunned silence.
Buffy snapped and grabbed David by his shirt.</p>

<p>"WILLOW'S PREGNANT?" Buffy yelled at David.</p>

<p>"I'm not! I mean I can't! I haven't had, well you know, with a guy
since Oz left! That was almost a year ago! I can't be pregnant!" Willow
babbled. A light bulb went over Giles' head.</p>

<p>"Warrior of Light, Guardian in White, Witch of Flame, will be bond.
And then the bond will be formed with blood. The child is from the bond."
said Giles.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy and Willow asked at the same time.</p>

<p>"The moment you three had your soul combined, that must have been when
the child was conceived." Giles said a little stunned. Buffy looked at David,
anger burning in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You knew! You knew for weeks but you didn't tell us!" Buffy roughly
shook David. "Why didn't you tell us?" she yelled at David.</p>

<p>"You want to know why?" David said angrily, and shoved Buffy away from
him. "I couldn't tell you. I was not allowed! There are shit tins of stuff
that I know but I couldn't tell you. Some things must happen and if you knew
then they wouldn't happen the way they should, even the things I don't like
or want! You think I like knowing things and not being able to say anything?
Things that are so important and impact on the lives of friends and family?
No one does, but I had to do what I had to do. Like it or not." He looked up
into the sky and saw the moon passing in front of the sun.</p>

<p>"It's almost time. Everyone take your positions." instructed David.
Everyone moved to their spots. Buffy glared at David.</p>

<p>"Buffy, if you want to discuss this more, then wait until this is
over, OK?" Giles told his Slayer. They stood there, waiting. The only sound
was the light breeze that blew across the hill. Giles gave a small chuckle.</p>

<p>"What?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Today is Saint Crispin's day, isn't it?" Giles asked his son. David
shrugged.</p>

<p>"I dunno, maybe." David replied. Giles gave another chuckle and turned
to face everyone. Standing before them, Giles saw his children. He felt great
pride at them, and greater love. He stood there, a sense of nobility of what
they were about to do radiated from Giles. In a deep and regal voice Giles
spoke to his children.</p>

<p>"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br>
For today that sheds his blood with me<br>
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br>
This day shall gentle his condition;<br>
And the gentlemen in England now a-bed<br>
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,<br>
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The smiles and looks from the group said it all. They were ready.
Looking out on the battle field they saw a white mist form in a line a few
hundred yards away. Silence gripped the hill. The mist became thicker and
more brilliant. It became a solid wall of white light. Then, as darkness fell
over the land, heralding the start of the eclipse, an immense sound came form
the white wall of light. It sounded as if God had torn the sky asunder. David
cried out at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>"CRY 'HAVOC' AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR!"</p>
