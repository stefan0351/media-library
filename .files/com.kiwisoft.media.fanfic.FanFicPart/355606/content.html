<p>After their little run in with Lily and Josh Sam and Faith went back
to snuggling under a tree.  They were as carefree as new young love
can be, just enjoying the presence and the loving embrace of the one
they loved.  Faith's back was leaning against the tree and Sam's head
was resting comfortably on her chest.  Everyone once in awhile Faith
would drop a soft kiss on top of Sam's head, but it was nothing
compared to the heated embrace they shared earlier when Lily had
caught them.  Despite her concerns about asking if anything else
could go wrong Sam was comfortable.</p>
<p>She loved the way Faith's arms fit around her body and held her
close.  She loved they way Faith smelt too.  Like leather and
cigarettes, it added a dangerous feel to the whole scene.  Sam
smirked, this must be her rebel phase, she mused.  Sam noticed as
Faith's hand came down and tore a piece of grass from the ground and
rolled it around in her fingers before dropping it, and then doing
again.  "I think it would take a while to get it all.easier to use a
mower."  Sam could feel Faith's chest vibrate with her chuckle and
her smirk grew into a smile.</p>
<p>"A mower, why would I want to do something sensible like that?"
Faith asked teasingly as she ran the fingers of her other hand
through Sam's thick hair.</p>
<p>Sam looked up at Faith to see a thoughtful expression on her face as
she stared back down at her.  "As corny as it sounds.what are you
thinking right now?"</p>
<p>"The was the mother of all corniness."  Faith responded with a smirk.</p>
<p>"So noted, and you final answer please?"</p>
<p>"Nickname."  Faith answered as if it explained everything.  Sam
looked up at her girlfriend with an expectant statement.  Seeing she
was going to get away with her answer, Faith explained, "I give
everyone nicknames.  Buffy is B."  Sam bristled a little, Buffy still
being a soft spot for her, it wasn't hard for her to tell the two of
the have, or had feelings for each other.  Faith continued without
notice to the sour statement on Sam's face, "Willow is Red.Tara is T.
Cordelia is Queen C.Giles is G-man.Xander is the Xandman.Oz was
wolfboy.Wesley.well Wesley was the putz."  Faith said with another
chuckle, although she knew Sam would have no idea why it was so
funny.  "I need one for you."</p>
<p>"Not too sure I want another nickname.  Everyone calls me Sam, or
sometimes Sammy."  Sam answered, she was almost afraid of what Faith
would come up with for her after hearing the other's names.</p>
<p>"I got it."  Faith answered confidently, nodding her head in
acceptance of whatever it was she was thinking in her head.</p>
<p>"What?"  Sam asked, steeling herself for whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Faith leaned down and attached her lips to Sam's.  "Samantha."  It
wasn't a nickname, but no one else called her that, and that was
enough for Faith, she just wanted a name for Sam that no one else
used.  Sam sighed, she didn't mind Faith using her full name, it
actually sounded good coming out of Faith's oh so sexy lips.</p>
<p>This time Sam initiated the kiss.  "I can live with that."</p>
