<!-- The Reason \ Part 1 -->

<p>Cordelia checked her outfit in the mirror, making sure she'd be able to move efficiently while bowling. Bowling. She smirked at the mirror. Not her choice activity, but since Xander had suggested it for their double date with Willow and Oz...she'd go along with it.</p>
<p>Keeping her relationship with Xander going strong was important to her, more now than ever. She reveled in the knowledge that Xander was devoted to her, and that they would probably be together for as long as she had interest in it. She briefly thought of the previous month when she had been toying with the idea of letting him go. I'm sure glad I didn't do that. I would be alone now. She thought.</p>
<p>Her decision not to dump Xander had not been solely hers though. It was Buffy who had told her after the night at her house, not to leave Xander. Buffy had acknowledged the guilt of seeing her behind his back, but she refused to allow Cordelia to burn her bridges so soon.</p>
<p>Thanks for thinking of me when you were playing nursemaid for your demon ex-boyfriend. She thought to herself sarcastically. I bet you felt guilty about keeping your ex a secret so you made me keep Xander just in case I found you out. Great job Buffy. She felt angry now, her good mood quickly fading. Checking the time, she groaned at her slight lateness and headed downstairs to her car.</p>

<p>"Hey Oz. Where's Xander and Willow?" Cordelia asked Oz as she scanned the empty science lab. She was glad she wasn't the only one late.</p>
<p>Oz turned around slowly, his eyes still fixed to the mess on the counter and floor. "Hi Cordelia. I don't really know where they are...but wherever it is, it can't be too good. Check out the mess."</p>
<p>Cordelia studied the counter for a moment. "Willow was doing spells? Maybe something happened." She said, fear starting to sink in.</p>
<p>"Let's go find Giles. Maybe knows where they are, and if he doesn't, he can help us find out." Oz suggested, already heading for the door.</p>
<p>"Wait, where are you going to find him at this time of night?" Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>Oz turned and looked at Cordelia. "The library is where I'm guessing."</p>
<p>"That guy really does have no life." Cordelia mumbled as she quickly followed Oz out of the lab and down the hall.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Buffy lay on her bed staring at the ceiling, the same thoughts repeating over and over in her head. Xander and Willow....cheating on Oz and Cordelia.</p>
<p>She had known about this for a few hours now, it being two in the morning. Angel had gone lurking at the hospital and listened from afar as Xander and Willow argued in the waiting room, eventually picking up what had happened. He had found her at home getting ready for bed, and since he had left, she hadn't moved from the spot she was laying in now.</p>
<p>Willow must have been trying to tell me about her and Xander when we were patrolling. I can't believe they would do something like that....cheating on Oz and Cordy...but I guess they probably figured they were going to die locked up by Spike, and Xander was hurt. Hell if they're forgiving of me, I should probably be forgiving of them.</p>
<p>As for Cordelia being injured, Buffy tried not to think about it. When Angel had told her that part, she had frozen in shock. She had just seen Cordelia earlier that evening when she and Oz had come looking for Giles' help in finding Xander and Willow. Knowing Cordelia had come close to death frightened Buffy terribly.</p>
<p>To think a year or even a couple of months ago I wouldn't have felt like this. Damn, I care about her so much now, I wish I could close the distance that has settled between us. But it's my fault.</p>
<p>Sighing, Buffy closed her eyes and tried to fall asleep, but she couldn't stop thinking. She decided she'd go and talk to Willow in the morning, and if she could she'd go and visit Cordelia in the hospital. That managed to ease her mind a bit and eventually she fell asleep.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The next morning Buffy talked to Willow, all the while pretending to hear the story for the first time. It was good to get the details though. An iron rod had impaled Cordelia! Buffy had paled at that...Cordelia was lucky to be alive. She wanted to see her more than ever now.</p>
<p>For a while she tried to comfort Willow, devastated by her apparent split with Oz. Eventually Willow needed to get home, so Buffy was finally free to visit the hospital.</p>
<p>Checking for the room number at the nurse's station, Buffy was walking down the hallway towards Cordelia's room when she saw Xander leave one of the rooms further down the hall. That must be the one. She thought as Xander looked up and noticed her.</p>
<p>"Hey Xander, how's the head?" Buffy asked, smiling at her friend.</p>
<p>Xander attempted a smile, but failed miserably. "Hey Buffy. I'm fine, it's just sore a little." He replied quietly.</p>
<p>"I was just going to see Cordelia. How's she doing?" Buffy questioned.</p>
<p>"Actually I don't know." Xander said, "She wouldn't talk to me."</p>
<p>Buffy reached out and touched his arm. "Oh Xander, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Xander kicked at the floor half-heartedly. "Yeah well, I deserve it."</p>
<p>Buffy didn't know what to say to her friend. She looked at him for a moment and then gave him a hug. "Go home and get some
rest Xander. I'll see you later, alright?"</p>
<p>Xander managed a smirk for Buffy. "Later Buff." He said before walking away.</p>
<p>Buffy took a deep breath and walked to the doorway of Cordelia's room. Looking in the room, Buffy saw Cordelia starting at the opposite wall, tears streaking her face. She's really upset about Xander. She doesn't want to talk to me...It was stupid to come here.</p>
<p>Turning to leave, Buffy took one last look at Cordelia and paused. "Get well Cordelia." She whispered as she walked away.</p>
