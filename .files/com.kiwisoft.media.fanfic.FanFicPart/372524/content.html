<p><b>A/N:</b> Wow! I'm so glad everyone liked this! :D And don't worry, I have a plan (and it does involve Faberry goodness, cause I'm pathetically addicted to them). I hope this one lives up to expectations.</p>
<p><b>Musical Chairs</b></p>
<p>"I'm still bored."</p>
<p>"We <i>know</i>. Shut <i>up</i>," Santana hissed.</p>
<p>"We need a new game," Mercedes said.</p>
<p>Finn was still pouting, and Rachel was too busy wondering how Quinn Fabray had beaten <i>everyone</i> at a game about <i>her</i>—without even <i>trying</i>—to come up with another suggestion.</p>
<p>"What about 'Have You Ever'?" Kurt offered.</p>
<p>"That's a drinking game," Puck pointed out.</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>"So even if there's a drop of alcohol in Berry's house, she won't be letting us get at it."</p>
<p>"We could use food," Tina suggested.</p>
<p>Puck groaned. "That completely takes the fun out of it."</p>
<p>"Beggars can't be choosers," Santana reminded him.</p>
<p>"Well, even if we did use food, Mike ate all the cookies, and the rest of Rachel's food is vegan chick food that no one wants to eat."</p>
<p>"He has a valid point," Artie said, nodding.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"Okay, fine." Kurt huffed. "Rachel, do you have any board games that are not Monopoly or chess?"</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Rachel?" he prodded.</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh…games? Um, we don't play a lot of board games around here. I have a few Scene Its."</p>
<p>"Oh, that might be fun," Mercedes said. "What versions do you have?"</p>
<p>"Uh—"</p>
<p>"We can't play that. Brittany always loses," Santana cut in, shaking her head.</p>
<p>There was a collective sigh.</p>
<p>"…Karaoke?" Kurt said tentatively.</p>
<p>"No!" six of them said at once.</p>
<p>"Well, someone else come up with something then," he said irritably. "I'm out of ideas."</p>
<p>Mercedes patted his hand.</p>
<p>"What about musical chairs?" Mike suggested, bouncing in his chair.</p>
<p>"Are we five?" Puck asked.</p>
<p>"Artie can't play that," Tina added.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's cool. I could control the music," he said agreeably.</p>
<p>"That sounds fun," Brittany said, and when Santana narrowed her eyes at them, they groaned.</p>
<p>"I don't think I have enough chairs for everyone to play…" Rachel said, in a last-ditch effort to get out of it.</p>
<p>Santana glared. Thankfully, Mercedes decided to save Rachel from a slow, painful death.</p>
<p>"That's cool. Kurt and I can be the referees," she supplied. Kurt grinned at her. "That should leave enough, right?"</p>
<p>Rachel did the math. Damn it. Quinn sighed when she saw the diva's resigned look. Damn it, indeed.</p>
<p>"If we use my computer chair," Rachel sighed.</p>
<p>Puck leapt up. "I'll get it!"</p>
<p>"No! No way are you going in my room. Finn, would you please?"</p>
<p>"Fine," he grumbled.</p>
<p>Puck scowled. "Why do you trust <i>him</i> to do it?"</p>
<p>"Because <i>he</i> won't steal my underwear."</p>
<p>"Again, with the gross!" Quinn exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I'm not arguing with you," Rachel said.</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>"Noah, would you please go get the other chairs from the dining room?" She even batted her eyelashes.</p>
<p>"Oh, fine," he growled, dragging Matt behind him.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"Rachel, is every CD in your house something from Broadway?" Artie asked, shuffling through CDs.</p>
<p>"Of course not. My tastes in music aren't <i>that</i> limited. I have a few Celine Dion—"</p>
<p>Kurt perked up, but everyone else shouted, "No!" He drooped.</p>
<p>Rachel sighed. "As I was <i>saying</i>, I also have The All-American Rejects, The Supremes, Madonna, Lady Gaga—"</p>
<p>"This could go on for a while," Kurt said.</p>
<p>"Hey, you also have 3OH!3, don't you?" Puck asked.</p>
<p>Rachel turned red. "No."</p>
<p>"You do, too, I've <i>seen</i> it!"</p>
<p>Quinn rolled her eyes. "Let me guess. You were looking for good humping music and just happened to stumble across it while digging through her drawers, also with the ulterior motives of finding a condom and stealing a nice thong."</p>
<p>"I don't have thongs," Rachel mumbled.</p>
<p>"That's actually not true," Puck said. "I picked her up from her ballet class and she was doing a little extra practicing to it." He grinned. "Sexy as hell, but she wouldn't let me touch her while she was all sweaty."</p>
<p>"How much dating did you guys <i>do</i> while we weren't looking?" Santana asked, nose wrinkled.</p>
<p>"Not much," they admitted simultaneously.</p>
<p>"This all happened in the space of about three days," Rachel confessed, glancing nervously at a red Finn.</p>
<p>"Damn, you move fast, Berry," Santana commented.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat. "Well, Noah is very convincing in his persistent groping. It was either make out or be molested while trying to film my nightly MySpace video, and that's something I don't believe any of my viewers need to see."</p>
<p>"I definitely, definitely don't," Quinn said.</p>
<p>Again, there was awkwardness to be had.</p>
<p>"Are we going to play soon?" Brittany whispered to Santana.</p>
<p>She nodded to reassure her, and Puck said, "Who votes for 3OH!3?"</p>
<p>The boys—even Kurt—raised their hands. Rachel sighed when they cheered.</p>
<p>"You need a majority to win, you know," she said icily.</p>
<p>"Brittany, would you rather keep debating over what song to use or play?" Puck asked abruptly.</p>
<p>"Play!" she said immediately. "This is boring!"</p>
<p>Santana narrowed her eyes. Puck grinned. Rachel huffed.</p>
<p>"I'll go get it…" she grumbled.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"Will you press pause already?" Puck scowled. "I'm getting bored."</p>
<p>"You've been walking for two minutes," Mercedes pointed out.</p>
<p>"And it's boring."</p>
<p>"He's right. This was a lame idea," Finn groused. "OW! Jesus, Santana!"</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to protest you beating up my boyfriend, Santana," Rachel said. "I've discovered that he bruises fairly easily, and you aren't exactly a weakling."</p>
<p>"Hey! She's not beating me up!" Finn protested.</p>
<p>"I punched you," Santana pointed out. "That counts."</p>
<p>"Only in the arm," he mumbled.</p>
<p>"We can throw down right here, if you want, Finnessa."</p>
<p>"I'm not fighting you."</p>
<p>"'Fraid to get beat by a girl again?"</p>
<p>"Twice in one night <i>would</i> be pretty rough," Matt said.</p>
<p>Artie clicked pause before Finn could respond. They scrambled, and Tina was the first one out.</p>
<p>"I'm never fast enough," she said good-naturedly. Artie patted her knee.</p>
<p>Mercedes and Kurt pulled out another chair and Artie clicked play again.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you have this CD," Mike said.</p>
<p>"Or, really, that you own anything related to 3OH!3 at all," Matt agreed.</p>
<p>"They have a good beat," Rachel said defensively, "and not all their songs are about…that. I don't think. And just because I don't happen to display any particular interest in sexually tinted things does not mean I don't <i>occasionally</i> enjoy indulging in them. Most of the time, however, I find this band extremely offensive."</p>
<p>"You love them," Quinn said.</p>
<p>Rachel blushed.</p>
<p>"Quinn, you're really creepy tonight," Brittany observed.</p>
<p>"I haven't had a chance to be 'creepy' any other night," she replied.</p>
<p>Only Brittany and Quinn seemed to get that one.</p>
<p>"I'm having flashbacks to the fifth grade." Santana sighed.</p>
<p>"At least now you have boobs," Puck said.</p>
<p>"That's only a benefit to <i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"And me."</p>
<p>"And Brittany."</p>
<p>Artie clicked pause. There was a brief tussle between Mike and Matt before the latter finally got squeezed out and went to pout on the couch.</p>
<p>"Whose idea was this again?" Finn asked.</p>
<p>"Mike's," Rachel answered.</p>
<p>"Must you remember every little thing?" Mike demanded, frowning.</p>
<p>She shrugged.</p>
<p>"Bro? Lame idea," Finn told him. "OW!"</p>
<p>Santana scowled. "Quinn, Rachel. You've both dated this moron for longer than two dates. Does he learn new tricks?"</p>
<p>They shook their heads and said concurrently, "No."</p>
<p>"Hey! I did learn n—stuff! Didn't I learn you're allergic to lilies?" Finn asked pointedly.</p>
<p>"I'll give you that," Quinn said grudgingly.</p>
<p>There was a lull.</p>
<p>"But you still don't know anything about Rachel."</p>
<p>"Okay, <i>that's</i>—"</p>
<p>Artie hit pause. Finn was fuming, and he marched over to the spot next to Matt with a huff.</p>
<p>"She distracted me," he mumbled in quiet protest.</p>
<p>"Still, you didn't even try to sit," Kurt pointed out. "That means you're out."</p>
<p>The music started up again.</p>
<p>"This music <i>does</i> kind of make you feel like dancing," Mike said. "But I still don't see it going with ballet."</p>
<p>Puck grinned. "She probably practices freak-dancing to it."</p>
<p>"I do not!" Rachel squeaked indignantly.</p>
<p>"Puck, you <i>saw</i> her. Shouldn't you know how she was dancing?" Santana asked.</p>
<p>"I was a little focused on her ass," he said. "OW! Quinn, what the hell? My baby mama is turning on me. OW! The women are getting <i>violent</i> in here!"</p>
<p>"San, you've 'dated' this moron longer than it takes to recover from drinking several wine coolers. Does he learn new tricks?" Quinn asked sardonically.</p>
<p>Santana shook her head. "No."</p>
<p>"Hey, our sex was great!" Puck exclaimed. "And you thought so, too! You don't moan like <i>that</i> because you sorta, kinda might like it a little bit."</p>
<p>"You know, most women fake it at one time or another," Rachel said helpfully.</p>
<p>"She did not fake it!" he bellowed. "No one fakes it with Puckzilla!"</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Uh—"</p>
<p>"San, Brit, ever faked it under Puck?" Quinn asked casually. Both nodded. "There you go."</p>
<p>He looked too outraged to comment. Artie hit pause and they ran for seats. Santana and Puck got into a shoving match until the cheerleader stepped on his toe. He went limping to the sidelines.</p>
<p>"That was cheating," he protested.</p>
<p>"All the same, the injury has put you out of commission," Kurt said.</p>
<p>"Mercedes?" Puck growled.</p>
<p>"The judges are unanimous."</p>
<p>He sighed.</p>
<p>"I feel so alone," Mike said when they started walking again.</p>
<p>Brittany patted him.</p>
<p>"Girls are just more agile than boys," Rachel said.</p>
<p>"So you won't be alone for long," Quinn added.</p>
<p>"Are you sure it's agility?" Santana asked. "I think it's because you're short. You can maneuver yourself easier."</p>
<p>Rachel sighed. "My shortness only helps with people as tall as Finn. I can duck under his arms."</p>
<p>"How does that work when you guys are doing it?" Brittany asked curiously.</p>
<p>"He must eat pillow a lot," Santana commented.</p>
<p>"We do <i>not</i> do it!" Rachel screeched.</p>
<p>"And yet, the mental images remain," Quinn said thoughtfully. "Ew."</p>
<p>"For your information, the furthest base we've been to is—"</p>
<p>Santana huffed. "Artie, please hit pause so she shuts up."</p>
<p>He obeyed, and Mike was the one left standing after Rachel swept around him.</p>
<p>"See, Shorty? I was right."</p>
<p>"That had nothing to do with my height, Santana."</p>
<p>"Sure it did. You were below his range of vision. You swept under the radar."</p>
<p>"I'm not even that short! I'm only five foot two!"</p>
<p>"Yes. Only."</p>
<p>Rachel fumed.</p>
<p>"San, I think you made her mad," Brittany observed.</p>
<p>"Oops."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be so nonchalant. I don't think you really want to throw down with Berry," Quinn said.</p>
<p>Santana scoffed. "And why not?"</p>
<p>"Well, for one thing, you <i>just</i> pointed out that she's short. Not to mention, fast. It's kind of like trying to battle the Road Runner. You can keep trying, but he just keeps getting away."</p>
<p>Brittany giggled. "Can you make that noise?"</p>
<p>Rachel frowned. "What noise?"</p>
<p>"You know…'meep-meep'?"</p>
<p>"Um…I don't think so. Sorry."</p>
<p>Brittany drooped.</p>
<p>"She can make other noises, though," Puck commented.</p>
<p>"Noah!"</p>
<p>Artie hit pause. Quinn and Rachel scurried into their chairs, and Santana walked to the side with everyone else.</p>
<p>"Aw, San, you didn't have to give up," Brittany pouted.</p>
<p>"It's okay, B. I'll kick ass in the next game." Santana winked.</p>
<p>Brittany brightened, and Artie hit play.</p>
<p>"Is anyone else getting bored?" Finn asked.</p>
<p>"Puck probably is," Quinn replied.</p>
<p>"Yeeep."</p>
<p>"We could stop," Kurt offered.</p>
<p>"But no one has won yet," Rachel pointed out, confused. "I thought the point of playing games was to reach a conclusive ending with a clear winner."</p>
<p>There was another collective sigh.</p>
<p>"What does everyone want to play after this?" Mercedes asked.</p>
<p>"Hangman?" Matt suggested.</p>
<p>"That's a two-person game," Tina said.</p>
<p>"Apparently Matt doesn't remember how well our last two-person game went," Santana said, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>He scowled.</p>
<p>"We could play Pictionary," Artie proposed.</p>
<p>"Rachel doesn't have that," Kurt said.</p>
<p>Artie frowned. "What is wrong with you?"</p>
<p>Rachel blushed. "Nothing! We just don't happen to have a lot of time for board games around here. And why does every conversation have to come back to me tonight?"</p>
<p>"Well, we are in your house," Mercedes said pointedly.</p>
<p>"Rachel's right. We should stop talking about her before Quinn gets more material to write in her diary," Finn said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Do you want to go? Because I will take you down, Hudson," Quinn snarled.</p>
<p>"Down to Chinatown. And not for egg rolls, if you know what I mean," Artie muttered. Tina giggled.</p>
<p>He hit pause, and Rachel and Quinn plopped into their chairs. Brittany bounced to her spot next to Santana.</p>
<p>"I suppose you're going to make us keep going," Kurt said, frowning at Rachel.</p>
<p>"If you guys don't want to know who the musical chair winner is, fine," she said, folding her arms.</p>
<p>They sighed and Artie hit play again.</p>
<p>"I thought you were supposed to run in the last round," Puck said.</p>
<p>"I don't feel like it," Quinn retorted.</p>
<p>"Besides, it's not written anywhere. We're just saving our energy for when we most need it," Rachel said, nodding superiorly.</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>
<p>"You know who the best superhero of all time is?" Puck asked.</p>
<p>The girls tuned the impending argument out. Rachel shifted her circle tighter to the chair; Quinn mimicked the movement.</p>
<p>"Quinn?" Rachel prompted softly.</p>
<p>"Rachel?"</p>
<p>"How did you know the answers to all of those questions?"</p>
<p>"I discovered a few months ago that, much to my dismay, I actually listen when you talk."</p>
<p>"Wow."</p>
<p>"I know. I almost had an identity crisis."</p>
<p>"No, I meant 'wow' that you managed to subtly insult me while admitting to that."</p>
<p>"I'm talented."</p>
<p>"I know." Rachel frowned. "How did you know about the lip gloss and soap, though? I don't talk to people about that sort of thing. I don't think."</p>
<p>"I have eyes." Rachel arched a brow. Quinn sighed. "You pull that Cherry Bomb lip gloss out of your pocket every day before glee."</p>
<p>"And the soap?"</p>
<p>"I may have broken into your house and dug through your personal things."</p>
<p>She gaped. "What?"</p>
<p>Quinn rolled her eyes. "I'm kidding."</p>
<p>"You're not good at that."</p>
<p>"I'll work on it."</p>
<p>"Seriously, how did you know?" she prodded.</p>
<p>Quinn sighed. "Remember that day Matt accidentally hit you in the head with the football and we had to take you to the hospital because you passed out?"</p>
<p>"Vaguely."</p>
<p>"I…had to sit with you and when you woke up, I told you that you smelled interesting or something like that. You explained it to me and went back to sleep. End of story."</p>
<p>Rachel frowned. "Oh. But how did you—"</p>
<p>Artie clicked pause and they both lunged for the chair. Both were half-sitting on it, trying to scoot the other off.</p>
<p>"Yes! Girl fight! Finally, something <i>interesting</i> is happening!" Puck exclaimed.</p>
<p>Everyone started shouting and clapping, egging them on.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"You two are both really strong," Kurt decided.</p>
<p>"Neither of you has moved an inch," Mercedes agreed.</p>
<p>"Maybe we need to solve this another way," he suggested. "Like…you could do a sing-off."</p>
<p>"No freaking way, Hummel," Quinn growled.</p>
<p>"Oh! Mud-wrestling!" Puck exclaimed, grinning and high-fiving Mike.</p>
<p>"NO!" Quinn and Rachel shouted simultaneously.</p>
<p>"Fine. Be boring."</p>
<p>"What if you just tried again?" Santana offered, sounding bored.</p>
<p>"Ladies?" Kurt asked.</p>
<p>"Fine," Quinn grumbled.</p>
<p>"Fine with me," Rachel agreed.</p>
<p>They finally broke apart and stood, sighing.</p>
<p>"Ready, girls?" Artie asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Just do it."</p>
<p>He obeyed. The girls walked again, eyeing each other warily. The others clapped and cheered from the sides.</p>
<p>This time when Artie clicked pause, Quinn swung her leg over the chair and Rachel jumped in just in front of her. Kurt and Mercedes sighed. It was too close to call who sat first.</p>
<p>"Well, judges?" Finn prompted. "Who won?"</p>
<p>"Both their asses are on the chair," Santana pointed out. "They tied. Again."</p>
<p>"So we do it again," Rachel offered.</p>
<p>"I'm not doing it again," Quinn said.</p>
<p>Puck grinned. "That's what she said."</p>
<p>"I would hit you, but Berry is trapping me."</p>
<p>"You're the one who decided to straddle the chair, instead of sitting in it like a normal person."</p>
<p>"It was easier from where I was."</p>
<p>"Well, I guess this game is over," Tina said, shrugging. "What next?"</p>
<p>"It's not over," Rachel protested. "We're both still on the chair. You can't just end it with a tie."</p>
<p>"Yes, you can. That's why they have 'ties.' So you can have them," Mercedes replied.</p>
<p>"The first one to get up is the loser," Quinn cut in. "How about that?"</p>
<p>Rachel considered it. "Okay. But you are probably going to lose, just so you know. I can go hours without water."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm the one in the back."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>"So I can do this."</p>
<p>Quinn tickled her sides and Rachel shrieked.</p>
<p>"This is fun," Puck said happily.</p>
<p>"Well, now <i>I'm</i> bored. And I'm pretty sure Brit is, too. Right, B?" Santana asked.</p>
<p>"Very bored."</p>
<p>"So? What next?"</p>
