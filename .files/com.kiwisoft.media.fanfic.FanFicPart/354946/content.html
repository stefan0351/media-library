<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 18: First Bounty -->

<p>Josie crouched down in the bushes, concealing herself from the
		man hiding in the bunkhouse. Wilson wasn't worth that much, but it would be enough for her
		to leave with Rebecca and move on. He was wanted for armed robbery and was known to drink
		far too much in the evenings. All she had to do was wait for him to pass out and then she
		could tie him up and bring him back to town. Her eyes fell on a buckboard nearby. It would
		be perfect to transport him with. She stole over to the barn and found one strapping
		horse, albeit a bit smaller than Phoenix, who was still safely tucked away at the OK
		Corral. Still, he would do the job. Josie settled back in the bushes and waited for
		nightfall to come.</p>

		<p>Rebecca returned the book to Doc Jackson and looked around at the
		stores that littered the sides of the main street. Her eyes fell upon the saloon and her
		mouth watered for something tastier than stale water and bad coffee. She couldn't imagine
		any reason why she shouldn't go in and have a sarsaparilla or two or even a beer. Slipping
		two of the dollars Josie gave her into her bodice, Rebecca headed up the street and
		entered the watering hole.</p>

		<p>Signs of yesterday's activities were still apparent throughout
		the room. A pile of wood that used to be tables and chairs was piled in the corner, and a
		fair amount of broken glass was swept into a pile in the middle of the floor. Rebecca
		noted that two of the large mirrors on the wall showed cracks that she hadn't noticed
		there before. The barkeep looked up from polishing the bar and spotted her. He frowned and
		looked around for her trouble-making friend before walking up to her. "I don't want
		another fight in here today, Miss. Now you look like a nice child, you shouldn't be
		hangin' out in a place like this."</p>

		<p>"I'd like a sarsaparilla, please.", she said firmly,
		trying to sound every bit like her taller companion. The barkeep shook his head in defeat
		and handed her the bottle of soda. No sooner did she place her hand around the glass then
		his eyes widened and she heard footsteps behind her.</p>

		<p>"Well, now lookie what we have here? If it ain't the purty
		little thing that was with that bitch in black yesterday," the lanky man who sat
		across from Josie during the card game said as he put his grimy hand on Rebecca's
		shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Uh oh," she said softly, instantly regretting
		disobeying Josie's instructions.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>It was nearly daybreak when Josie pulled into town on the
		buckboard with her captive securely tied up in the back. She left the sheriff's office a
		few minutes later with a note for the bank to retrieve her money. The distrusting teller
		tested her patience as he stalled turning over the money to the well-armed woman. It took
		her returning with the sheriff in tow to retrieve her cash. After a long day of waiting,
		all she wanted to do was crawl into bed and sleep.</p>

		<p>The two mugs from yesterday's coffee were still sitting on the
		table when Josie entered their room. Frowning, she checked around to make sure that all
		their belongings were still there. She went downstairs and found the round woman who ran
		the boarding house.</p>

		<p>"Where's Rebecca?" The look she received from Miss
		Patricia chilled her to the bone.</p>

		<p>"I thought she was with you. I haven't seen her since
		yesterday. She left shortly after you did." There was fear in her eyes, but no sign
		of deceit. Josie turned on her heels and headed to the doctor's office.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Two hours later, Josie was leaning on a hitching post, looking
		around and trying to figure out where Rebecca could have gone. Lifting her hat and wiping
		her brow, her eyes fell upon the slatted doors of the saloon. Well, it wouldn't hurt to
		wet her whistle, she thought.</p>

		<p>The barkeep gave her a terrified look that went beyond the
		activities of two days past. "Whiskey," she barked as she leaned against the
		bar. She noted that his hands were shaking as he set the small glass in front of her.
		"I'm looking for my friend, the one that was with me the other day. You seen
		her?" Her tone made it clear that a lie wouldn't be tolerated. Sweat began to form on
		his brow as he backed up slowly. Quick as a cat, Josie reached over the bar and grabbed
		his shirt at the throat. She jerked him forward, slamming his gut against the wooden bar
		and stared menacingly at him, her face mere inches away from his. "Now you listen
		here, little man. Where is she?"</p>

		<p>"Ah...she...well..." She jerked him one more time,
		making sure that bruises would be left behind. "Ugh...he took her."</p>

		<p>"Who?" Her anger was at a frightening level as she
		cocked a gun and placed it against his nose. "I want answers and I want
		them...now," she nudged the cool steel against his face to punctuate her point.</p>

		<p>"Smith. Tom Smith...he took her." At her questioning
		look he added, "He's the one from the poker game."</p>

		<p>"Where?", she growled.</p>

		<p>"Ah..." Beads of sweat were rolling down his face,
		which was turning red from her grip on his collar. "Small ranch 'bout two hours north
		of here. The Double S."</p>

		<p>Without another word, she shoved him back and left the bar. It
		only took a few minutes to saddle Phoenix and tear off in search of her young friend.
		'Hurt her and I'll kill you,' she vowed. She also decided that Tombstone was too dangerous
		a place for Rebecca to stay without her.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca pounded on the door again. "Please let me out. It
		stinks in here," she bellowed, knowing that no one could hear her. The outhouse was
		too far away from the main house. She shoved at the door again. The ropes used to hold the
		door closed showed no signs of budging. "Of all the places to stick me," she
		muttered before resuming her pounding.</p>

		<p>Josie looked down from her perch on the hillside at the lone
		ranch. The area was too wide open and flat for her to attempt anything during the day. If
		she made a run at the ranch, Rebecca would be dead before she could reach her. Being out
		of earshot, she was unable to hear the young woman's calls for help from the small
		building set so far behind the main house. The gunslinger forced herself not to think
		about the possibilities of what could happen to her young friend while she waited. It was
		hard enough not to go blazing in there with guns drawn without having to think of
		Rebecca's innocence being threatened. She impatiently waited for darkness to fall.</p>

		<p>Two lamps burned brightly inside the ranch as Josie crept up
		alongside the small building. She needed to know how many men she was dealing with and
		exactly where Rebecca was before she could make a move. Looking through the small window
		partially obscured by a dirty piece of cloth being used as a makeshift curtain she could
		only make out some of the room, noting that there were two rooms off of the main room that
		she couldn't see into. She watched as the lanky man she fought with at the saloon rose and
		headed to the door. She quietly slipped around the side as he came outside. She watched as
		he pulled down his britches, squatted, and relieved himself. Her brow furrowed. Why was he
		doing that there instead of the outhouse? He went back inside and she headed behind the
		house. She grinned when she saw the ropes wrapped around the small wooden structure.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca," she whispered.</p>

		<p>"Josie? Oh Josie, please let me out of here."</p>

		<p>"Shh." There was silence for a moment before Rebecca
		heard the sound of the ropes being cut and the door opening. She stepped out and fell to
		her knees, gulping in draughts of fresh air. Josie grabbed her and pulled her behind the
		side of the outhouse. "Are you all right?" In the dim moonlight, she tried to
		visually inspect Rebecca for any signs that would confirm her fears.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine, I'm just glad you're here."</p>

		<p>"Come on, I want to be long gone before he realizes that
		you're missing."</p>

		<p>It was at that time that Smith decided to go check on his
		captive. He was really disappointed that the tall bitch in black hadn't decided to pay him
		a visit. He was looking forward to getting her back for his black eye. He chuckled to
		himself as he thought of other things he could be looking forward to. It didn't make a
		difference to him if that girl lived or died; she was only good as bait for the bitch.
		Perhaps a little fun with her was called for, a payback to her friend for besting him in
		cards. He froze when he saw the partially open door to the outhouse. He never heard her
		come up behind him. One sharp contact with the butt of her gun on his skull was all it
		took to send him bonelessly to the ground.</p>

		<p>"What are you going to do with him?" Rebecca asked as
		she watched Josie tie his hands and feet together.</p>

		<p>"Take him back to town to answer for his crime." She
		double-checked her knots before stepping away from him. "He's lucky I didn't just
		kill him."</p>

		<p>"Josie, I wasn't hurt. Just shaken up a bit."</p>

		<p>"But you could have been," Josie snapped, taking a step
		closer to her. "What in tarnation did you think you were doing going into a saloon
		alone? You could have been killed." She grabbed the smaller woman's chin and forced
		her gaze upward to look at her. "Or worse, Rebecca. When I tell you to stay
		somewhere, stay there."</p>

		<p>"I-I'm sorry," she stammered. Josie released her grip
		and took a step back.</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, Rebecca. Just improve. I'm tired of
		rescuing you." There was anger in her voice, but something else as well, a touch of
		concern. She turned to pick up her quarry and place him across the back of his horse.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for saving me...again," Rebecca said softly.
		She was certain that Josie heard her, but chose to ignore her.</p>

		<p>Josie looked at Rebecca's dirty dress, then at the horse, then
		back to her. "How did he get you here?"</p>

		<p>"He uh kinda threw me over the saddle. That horn really
		hurts when it's pressed against your ribs, you know."</p>

		<p>"No, Rebecca, I've never had that pleasure," she
		sighed. "You'll just have to ride side saddle. We can't keep cutting your dresses
		every time you need to ride."</p>

		<p>The ride back to town took longer than it should have because
		Josie had to make certain that Smith didn't fall off the horse, although she was tempted
		to shove him off a few times just to see him fall to the ground. Once he woke up and tried
		to wiggle off the saddle only to have Josie knock him back into dreamland.</p>

		<p>After depositing him with the sheriff, Josie dropped Rebecca off
		at the boarding house and took the horses to the corral. Despite wanting a hot bath, Josie
		opted for the cool sheets and soft pillow upon returning to the room. She was so tired
		that she didn't even bother to remove her boots or holsters. It took some effort but
		Rebecca finally managed to get the two holsters off. She gave up on the idea of pulling
		the black leather boots off and decided to wear her own to bed to protect her feet from
		the hard heels. Crawling into bed next to her protector, she whispered a quiet thank you
		before settling down on her side and going to sleep.</p>
