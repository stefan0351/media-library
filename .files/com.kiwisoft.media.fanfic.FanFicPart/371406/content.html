<p>A/N: Hey peoples, still totally phyched out at the number of reviews I'm getting for this story. For some weird reason the number of reviews for the last few chapters have been in greater number than the first few chapters. Which is weird for me, as it usually goes down instead of up But that probably has to do with the amount of time between updates... and how slow I am... Well, I won't dwell on it, I'm just gonna embrace it as they say. So yeah, thanks for keeping me on my toes everyone! Its appreciated :)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>After what was dubbed the 'incident that never happened', Viola immersed herself in her soccer practice. Viola pushed her feelings aside and focused on putting her skills against the grindstone. Duke coached her like a drill instructor, adding some new moves to her already impressive soccer repertoire. And Viola ate it all up, taking up any scrap of knowledge thrown at her with tunnel-visioned determination. She wanted to learn everything she could to step on the field against Cornwall.</p>
<p>Olivia took to a form of comfort which was in itself an evil entity against the female species when in despair... ice cream. Olivia threw aside yet another ice-cream sandwich wrapper, adding to the ever-growing pile on her dorm floor. She stared at the pile for a full minute before sighing disgustingly at herself.</p>
<p>What the hell was she doing? It has only been a full day and a half since Viola has spoken a word to her and here she was pigging out and sulking over the fact!</p>
<p><i>'I didn't have to take this! I am my own woman, and that soccer-crazed, cross-dresser, and hard-headed unlady-like girl does not run my life!'</i></p>
<p>Olivia nodded her head in agreement with her own little pep-talk and got up from her tiny bed to stand with the pride fit for a debutante. And as she walked the three steps across her threshold, Cheetos crunching under her feet at each step, she held her head up high with pride!</p>
<p>Well, all those words came down like a house of cards the moment the blond spotted Viola in the weight room, looking like a clumsy boy.</p>
<p>Olivia had had a mind to go work off her guilt after spending the night pigging-out in sweats too big for her. But the girl's heart simply fluttered anew when Viola presented herself to her eyes. Olivia was about a second away from throwing herself at Viola's feet and beg for her to take her back as a friend, but she held herself back. The poor blond felt even more low when she saw Duke there as well, displaying to all the world his hunky manliness for Viola to feast her eyes on.</p>
<p>"Sexy bastard!" Olivia muttered to herself as she mounted the nearest machine to her and started her work out before she was tempted to run back to her junk food. It didn't seem like Viola had noticed her entrance at all. Olivia was mildly grateful, because she didn't think she'd be able to handle the awkward silence that was sure to ensue.</p>
<p>At that moment Viola's soccer coach entered the weight room and approached Viola, looking serious. Olivia watched with a critical eye, observing Viola's happy reaction to whatever news Coach Dinklage brought. Based off Viola's reaction Olivia deduced that she probably got good news concerning her role in the team. Viola and Duke jumped up to hug each other after he left. Olivia started working her body more furiously at the happy exchange. Why couldn't she share this moment with Viola instead of Duke? She briefly amused herself with the thought of throwing one of the weights at Duke's head.</p>
<p>Olivia sighed at herself. First she was all 'Be you own woman!' or some crap, and now she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. How long was she going to sulk over the fact that Viola will never ever in a million years have feelings for her?</p>
<p>Olivia's head snapped up as a thought occurred to her. What if Viola DID have feeling for her? The thought made her shudder as the forbidden vines of hope engulfed her mind. Olivia knew Viola well enough to know that if she DID have feelings for her, it would probably take a while for her to realise them. So it was entirely possible for Viola to have hidden depths of feeling towards Olivia and not know it!</p>
<p>So what was Olivia to do about it? <i>'Awaken them, that's what!</i>' The blond answered her own question. But then Olivia sighed again when the question of 'how?' came up. She had no experience in this sort of thing since shes only had one boyfriend in her life. And there was always the possibility that Viola didn't harbor any sort of feelings towards her. The blond growled to herself. Her looping thought process was getting nowhere helpful at all.</p>
<p>"So cute..." she whispered to herself as she stared longingly at Viola who was currently tripping awkwardly on her own feet trying to carry a weight too big for her.</p>
<p>"Duke? Yeah." a voice agreed with her mistakenly, making Olivia jump in surprise. The voice belonged to her friend Maria, who was gazing lustfully at Duke.</p>
<p>"No, I meant Sebastian." Olivia corrected. "He's so cool." she added just to heighten Viola's popularity, even though at the moment Viola was turning blue from the iron bar of a weight pushing down on her throat until Duke lifted it off of her with one hand.</p>
<p>"So whats the problem? Go get em'!" Maria encouraged. Olivia hesitated.</p>
<p>"But..." Olivia decided she'd confide in her friend. "But you see, we've already gone out and he just doesn't seem interested." Olivia said, carefully tip-toeing over the subject.</p>
<p>"How could he not be interested, you're everyones type!" Maria looked skeptical.</p>
<p>"Not his!" Olivia answered helplessly. She didn't even know if Viola liked girls or not.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell you what us mere mortals would do in this situation."</p>
<p>"What?" Olivia asked curiously. She'd take any advise right now.</p>
<p>"Make him jealous."</p>
<p>"Jealous?" Olivia quickly considered this suggestion. If she wanted to awaken any feelings Viola might have for her, testing for any jealousy was a safe bet. If it ended up Viola didn't get jealous at all, then Olivia could get away with Viola unaware of her ploy. "You mean, just go out with someone else?"</p>
<p>Maria nodded her head. "And use him shamelessly."</p>
<p>"Huh." Olivia said thoughtfully. She didn't know about the use 'use shamelessly' part, but the plan just might work.</p>
<p>"Congrats about joining first string, man." Duke congratulated his beaming roommate. Viola wiped her nose in a boastful manner, milking the moment for all it was worth.</p>
<p>"I know, brah. Dinklage recognizes a good slice of cheese when he sees one." Viola slapped her chest.</p>
<p>"Again with the cheese?" Duke laughed.</p>
<p>"So, you want me to spot you?" Viola offered as Duke sat down on a bench.</p>
<p>"Do as you like." Duke said. Viola then spotted Olivia out of the corner of her eye and turned her head fully in the other girl's direction. For a moment it was like the events that had transpired between them never happened at all, and Viola was happy to see her blond friend again after not seeing her for a while. But that happiness quickly turned to confusion when Olivia didn't look at her at all. Instead, she was looking at Duke.</p>
<p>"Hey, Duke." Olivia greeted warmly. At her voice Duke raised his head to look at her in surprise and immediately stood up.</p>
<p>"Oh! Uh.. Hey, Olivia." Duke greeted back awkwardly as if he reverted back to a young boy in front of his crush. Olivia glanced at Viola briefly to see if she had her full attention. She did.</p>
<p>"Hi, Olivia." Viola spoke up, trying to get Olivia to look in her direction.</p>
<p>"Sebastian." Olivia said curtly, barely acknowledging her presence. It was if she kicked a puppy. Viola flinched at Olivia's suddenly cold attitude towards her.</p>
<p>"225? Hmmm, very impressive." Olivia almost purred in Duke's direction when she saw how much he had been lifting. "How many lifts can you do with that?"</p>
<p>"Uh, like twenty." Duke's head connected with the metal bar he had been trying to lean on comically. Viola had to walk away from the scene since watching was becoming too much to bear.</p>
<p>"Wow, that's more than twice as much as I weigh." Olivia said in a flirtatious tone. "How many lifts can you do with me?"</p>
<p>It took a few seconds for Duke to mentally calculate the complicated figures. "Uhh, forty?" he finally answered. Viola watched these events happen from a few paces away. For some reason, no matter how much she didn't want to, she couldn't bring herself to walk away completely. So she stayed and watched two of her friends have something resembling a conversation, even though it was almost painful for her to do so.</p>
<p>Olivia had slowly brought herself closer to the taller jock, the nervous sweat on Duke's brow and his faint blush becoming more obvious the more seductive she acted. She slowly brought her hand up to lightly trail down Duke's forearm, making Duke take a step back away from her, looking even more uncomfortable than ever.</p>
<p>"So, what do you say we meet at Cesario's tonight?" she offered with a flirty smile. She was aware of Viola's gaze on them and she flirted with Duke for all she was worth. She did this for love! Or so she told herself. She tried not to linger on the thought that flirting with another man for love didn't make much sense at all.</p>
<p>"Um..." Duke shook his head as if snapping himself from under her spell. Olivia felt a twinge of doubt at her choice of man when he raised an eyebrow at her. "Look, Olivia... I don't know whats going on with you and I don't want to know. Sebastian, who happens to be my friend, has broken up with you recently and I don't think its right to go out with a friend's ex."</p>
<p>Olivia was stunned to say the least. She had been counting on Duke's obvious crush on her to not reject her. It seemed the shy jock had a strong code of conduct towards his friends.</p>
<p>Duke spoke more strongly as he went along, as if he was unraveling her plot slowly in his mind. "And at the carnival it seemed to me that you did everything you could to stop me from kissing his sister." Duke said, remembering how Olivia had glared at him in that moment and how protective and possessive she had been with the other girl.</p>
<p>Olivia took a step back away from him as his words affected her will to continue the charade and stared at the floor in shame. "So I'm confused as to what you're trying to play at by asking me out now after all that?" Duke told her sternly, the blush still on his face despite his clearly focused gaze on her. Olivia felt the prickle of tears in her eyes as she continued to look at the floor, knowing Duke's words to be true.</p>
<p>She slowly shook her head, refusing to lift her gaze to the jock's. "I see." she said, walking away from him. "I'm sorry for wasting our time." She had to get out of there. And she was all but outright ran out of the gym in shame at her own actions. A dumbstruck Viola watched her leave.</p>
<p>"What the hell just happened?" Viola asked aloud, her voice going up an octave by accident since she wasn't focused at the moment.</p>
<p>"I have not the faintest idea, bro." Duke answered from directly behind her, starling Viola out of her daze. "This whole situation just seems really whacked out. I'd hate to be you right now." Duke admitted, staring after Olivia with concern in his eyes. Viola nodded her head in agreement that yes, this was really whacked out. Olivia's odd behavior replayed over and over in her mind, and it just didn't make any sense to her. The very idea that Olivia had looked at Duke in <i>that</i> way, talked to him in <i>that</i> way... Viola's fist clenched in anger.</p>
<p>"But WHY?" Viola blurted out, referring to why she was experiencing such a swell of emotions within her that she didn't recognize. Why she was feeling so angry, so <i>frustrated</i>. And over what? That Olivia had ignored her? That she made Viola feel like she was at fault for something she was not aware of?</p>
<p>"How the hell should I know!" Duke said back in the same loud tone, startled from his roommate's sudden outburst. "But whatever it is, I think you gotta settle it with her."</p>
<p>"Settle it." Viola repeated quietly to herself, taking Duke's advise. She silently decided that the next time she saw Olivia, she would pry the reason Olivia was acting so strangely out of her whether the blond liked it or not.</p>
<p>She suddenly snorted loudly and boisterously. "What women need is to stay in the kitchens and make babies!" she declared so loudly that the whole gym paused to stare at her. "Right?" She had thought that is what a normal guy would say?</p>
<p>"Dude, that's messed up." Duke chortled, smacking his teammate up-side the head. Viola made an 'ow!' in protest to the violence. There was a pause as the rest of the gym went back to their work out and routines. Viola cleared her throat before speaking.</p>
<p>"Hey, Duke, thanks for... you know." Viola said sincerely, referring to what had happened with Olivia. "You're a good friend." It was obvious that Duke held friendship in high respects and didn't tolerate betrayal.</p>
<p>Duke flashed a quick grin at her. "No problem. Us guys have to look out for each other." Duke suddenly looked wistful. "Still, the thought that Olivia Lennox, the hottest girl in school, might have actually been interested in me was pretty tempting." Viola punched Duke in the shoulder hard enough for him to him to feel it. "Ow!" Duke rubbed his arm and glared at his friend.</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it." Viola said protectively. Duke rolled his eyes at her.</p>
<p>"Whatever." He went back to the benches to restart his workout. Viola stayed behind, looking in the direction Olivia had left in a hurry with a hesitant expression. Should she have gone after Olivia? She remembered the hurt she had experienced when Olivia treated her like a fly to swat away and another flare of anger hit her and she shook her head. It would be too painful to look at Olivia again so soon after the wound was still fresh.</p>
