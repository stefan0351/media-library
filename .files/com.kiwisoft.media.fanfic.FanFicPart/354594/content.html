<!-- Girls Movie Night \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>“… care that you said no, I wanna watch it!” Anya
scowled at Buffy as she tried to wrestle the video out
of the slayers firm grip.</p>

<p>“No Anya. I told you I am not watching this damn
movie!” Winning the battle, Buffy yanked the tape from
the ex-demon’s grip and flung it across the room. Her
extra slayer strength kicked in and the tape shattered
into pieces and flew all over the living room.
Everyone just stood their ground stunned.</p>

<p>“Um…” It was, surprisingly, Tara who was the first to
speak. Raising her hand slightly as if asking a
question in school, “Um… what movie was it?”</p>

<p>Suddenly the other three burst out laughing. Tara
watched the three with an amused look on her face not
quite understanding what was so funny. When every one
finally settled down, Anya spoke up.</p>

<p>“Well, we could talk about sex instead.” She dove her
hand into the bowl of popcorn in front of her and
started munching.</p>

<p>“Anya!” Willow warned, not wanting to head down a road
she knew would upset Tara. </p>

<p>“Yeah, come on Wills it’ll be fun.” Okay Buffy chiming
in was absolutely no help at all and Willow frowned.</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Now Willow was shocked! “Um Tara are you sure?” She
couldn’t believe her girlfriend had just said ‘okay.’</p>

<p>“Hey look, if there’s any question that someone is too
uncomfortable to answer, then don’t” Anya interjected
while grabbing a handful of M&M’s. </p>

<p>Willow looked into Tara’s eyes waiting for the other
girl to take the lead. “It’s okay Willow. It’s okay.”
She reassured her as best she could. </p>

<p>Willow grinned loopily and lead them both over to the
couch, “We’re in.” </p>

<p>Everyone got comfy. Anya slid back under her sleeping
bag but sat up leaning against the coffee table. Buffy
slid closer to Willow on the floor and stretched her
legs out under the same table, while Willow and Tara
sat next to each other on the couch. </p>

<p>“So who should start?” The question came from Willow. </p>

<p>“Um… since it was my suggestion, I go first.” Anya
beamed and then concentrated. What do I want to know…
what do I want to know. She pondered. “Okay,” she sat
up gleefully, “how many times, oh say in the last
seven days, has everyone had sex?”</p>

<p>Buffy frowned and Willow began to count on her
fingers.</p>

<p>“Um, clarify ‘times’?” Buffy asked.</p>

<p>Anya looked at her like she was stupid. “You know, how
many times you and Riley have bounced each other off
the walls.”</p>

<p>Tara giggled and covered her mouth and both Willow and
Anya turned and smiled at her warmly. </p>

<p>“Oh,” Buffy said. “Well you first since it was your
question.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Anya bounced happily. “Over the last seven
days Xander and I have had sex 10 times.” She
exclaimed quite proud of herself.</p>

<p>Buffy grumbled, “Well over the past seven day’s I’ve
had sex… two times.” She almost looked down in shame,
but even more in anger when Anya looked over at her
like she was pathetic.</p>

<p>“Poor slayer.” She said patting her hand. </p>

<p>Buffy growled at her.</p>

<p>“Okay, you two?” The ex-demon pointed at Willow and
Tara expectantly.</p>

<p>Willow finished counting on her fingers and spoke up.
“Okay in the last seven days we’ve had sex 12 times!”</p>

<p>“What!” Anya screamed as if she’d been wounded. Buffy
just looked at both girls with her mouth wide open…
and Tara blushed quite smugly.</p>

<p>“Are you telling me that the two of you are ‘doing it’
almost twice a day?” Anya said in disbelief. When
Willow’s giggling kicked in, she knew that she was
telling the truth. “Damn it! Xander needs to start
picking it up! Damn it! No more sleep for him, no
sire-e… I want more sex!” </p>

<p>Buffy just felt kind of… well, left out.</p>

<p>“Who’s next?” Willow’s bubbling happiness was
infectious.</p>

<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>“Hey, you already went!” Buffy glared at Anya.</p>

<p>“So what, my game, my rules.” Anya stuck her tongue
out at the slayer and posed her next question before
anyone else could protest. “Okay, what is the most
risky place you’ve ever had sex… and you can’t include
the kitchen.” She looked straight at Willow and Tara. </p>

<p>“Hey!” Willow pouted. “Doesn’t matter. We’ve done it
in much better places anyway.” And just as she was
about to spill the beans, Tara finally chimed in.</p>

<p>“Um… W-W-illow.” She wasn’t too sure she wanted the
others to know such a thing. </p>

<p>“We don’t have to answer Tara. It’s okay.” Willow
turned to her girlfriend and held onto her hand. While
they were deciding, Buffy spoke up.</p>

<p>“Well, Riley and I have done it in the cemetery.” She
offered cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Big deal.” Anya scoffed. “Like who hasn’t had sex in
the cemetery?” </p>

<p>Buffy pouted and looked at Willow expecting her friend
to chirp in with a negative. When she saw Willow shrug
at her apologetically and grin, she knew right there
and than that she was not going to like this game one
damn bit!</p>

<p>“Well, what about you Anya?” She asked annoyed.</p>

<p>“Xander and I have had sex in his ice cream truck…”</p>

<p>Before she could finish Buffy interrupted, “What’s so
‘daring’ about that?”</p>

<p>“Well if you’d let me finish!” Anya huffed, “As I was
saying, we had sex in the ice cream truck while Xander
was driving it on the freeway.” She stuck her tongue
out at the blonde and Buffy instantly tried to grab
for it. She really did want to rip it out of the
ex-demon’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Okay, the witches turn.”</p>

<p>“Well, we had sex at the Bronze.” Willow was quite
enjoying herself, especially when her two friends
turned and looked at her eagerly, waiting for her to
spill all the details. </p>

<p>“Actually, w-w-we’ve had sex there a couple of times.”
Willow beamed as Tara’s voiced caressed the room with
ease. She was beginning to loosen up.</p>

<p>“A couple of times?” Buffy asked and Willow just
nodded with a silly grin on her face. </p>

<p>“Where else?” Anya was all intrigued now.</p>

<p>“Um…” Tara thought a moment, “Well,” she ducked her
head shyly, “we did it in Mr. Giles’ bathroom once.” </p>

<p>A shocked gasp escaped from Buffy’s lips, while Anya
just looked appreciatively at the shy witch. </p>

<p>“I’ve always wanted to give that room a try. How was
it?”</p>

<p>“Surprisingly spacious.” Tara continued. “And the
bathtub is really quite large and roomy.” </p>

<p>“Um, I’ll have to drag Xander in there during one of
your boring Scooby meetings.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” Buffy and Willow objected at once. Willow
continued. “Scooby meetings are NOT boring. You’re
boring.” </p>

<p>“Oooo, I’m so hurt.” Anya rolled her eyes and popped
another M&M in her mouth.</p>

<p>Cautiously, Buffy ventured, “So where else have the
two of you…” she pointed at the girl’s rather than
saying it.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean, Tara’s room, of course. Our room… um,
Giles… the Bronze…” Willow trailed off for a moment as
she thought; “We did it in the laundry room of
Stevenson once… or twice. Well, pretty much every time
we do our laundry there. And well, oh,” Willow bounced
excitedly, “We did it in the park once, near a tree,
in broad daylight.” Grinning happily she continued.
“And of course, the cemetery… cause everyone’s done it
there. Oh, the Magic Box…”</p>

<p>“What? When the hell did you do it at the store?”
Buffy was slightly, well numb. She just listened in
awe as her friend ticked off one by one all the places
she had had sex with her girlfriend. Trying to think
about where she had ‘done it’ with Riley. There was
Riley’s, and there was the cemetery… once, and her and
Willow’s dorm room… once, and than there was… well
Riley’s! Man, here she was completely out-sexed by an
ex-demon and her shy, kinda geeky, but not so much
geeky anymore, best friend. </p>

<p>“It was right after Mr. Giles bought it and we were
all helping clean it out.” Tara started saying only to
be interrupted by Willow.</p>

<p>“Yeah, every one went out to get some food, and oh
yeah, Buffy you went out on patrol with Riley, so we
just… well sort of, took advantage of the aloneness.” </p>

<p>“Very smart.” Anya said rather clinically. “You should
take every opportunity when it presents itself.”</p>

<p>“Okay, next question… has anyone ever used toys?”</p>

<p>“What!” Buffy was SO not liking this game. </p>

<p>“Toys ya know dil…”</p>

<p>“Yeah Anya I know, I know. Please stop.”</p>

<p>“So I guess that’s a no for the slayer. Girls?”</p>

<p>“Um, w-w-we’ve talked about it, but we haven’t… um,”
Tara shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“We haven’t seen the need.” Willow smiled at her
girlfriend.</p>

<p>“Oh well, toys could be very advantageous.”</p>

<p>Buffy just buried her head in her hands. She didn’t
think she could survive the entire night of listening
to Anya give Willow and Tara sex tips. Especially
considering that the two wiccans seemed quite a head
of the game already. Well, at least WAY ahead of her!

“Really?” Willow asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Xander and I find them quite amusing. Just
adds that extra humph to things… if you get my
meaning.” She winked at the two witches who both
blushed.</p>

<p>The three of them broke down into a fit of giggles for
a moment before Anya suddenly posed a question she had
been dying to ask all evening. “So Tara…” the ex-demon
looked poignantly at the blonde, “is Willow the first
person you’ve ever had sex with?” </p>

<p>“Ummm…”</p>

<p>“Hey! I thought we were suppose to ask questions we
could all answer.” Willow jumped to Tara’s defense, as
the blonde looked a bit flustered by the question
directed at her. </p>

<p>Anya just shrugged, “All right. So who was the first
person everyone had sex with?” She stuck her tongue
out at Willow.</p>

<p>Willow scowled at her, but answered, “Oz.”</p>

<p>“Angel.” Buffy said quickly. At least this question
was easy.</p>

<p>“Well, the first time I had sex was with farmer
Lisioux son.” Anya shivered at the not-so-fond memory.
“He owned the farm right next to my fathers. Um, Jack…
Jack was his name. He slobbered all over me for about
five minutes and when he was done, he wept like a
baby. Ick.” Anya was very… very happy that she now had
Xander.</p>

<p>Tara finally answered, feeling comfortable now that
everyone also had. “Willow.” She said with a happy
smile.</p>

<p>“So have you always liked girls Tara?” Anya said as
she grabbed another handful of popcorn.</p>

<p>Again Willow shot the ex-demon a nasty look. </p>

<p>“Yes.” Tara answered softly.</p>

<p>Before Willow could scold her again, Anya asked
everyone else. “What about you two?” She pointed salty
fingers towards Willow and Buffy. “Girls?” </p>

<p>The two friends looked at each other a moment, an
awkwardness crossing between them. Willow really
wasn’t sure this was something she wanted to start
talking about. She looked back at Anya, who kept
stuffing food in her mouth, and than to Tara, who was
looking at her with interest; Willow decided to just
tell the truth.</p>

<p>“Yes…” </p>

<p>Buffy looked at her strangely.</p>

<p>“I mean… I’ve always kinda ya know, “ Willow squirmed
slightly but calmed when she felt Tara’s thumb
stroking across her hand. “I’ve had crushes on girls,
in high school, and stuff like that. But I really
didn’t think about it much till VampWillow.” She
turned to Anya, “Thank you very much!” </p>

<p>Anya stuck her tongue out again.</p>

<p>“And, I don’t know, I had Oz… but sometimes…” Willow
suddenly really didn’t want to talk about this.</p>

<p>“Go on.” To her surprise, it was Buffy that told her
to continue.</p>

<p>“I guess, there was this girl last year, in my
freshman English class, and I just thought how nice it
would be to kiss her.” Willow looked around the room
eyes wide with tepid fear.</p>

<p>Anya had a slightly disinterested glint in her eyes.
Buffy had a frown and Tara… Willow wasn’t sure, but
she thought Tara looked slightly upset. </p>

<p>“I didn’t do anything… I just… just thought about it.
And then I met Tara,” Willow beamed at the blonde,
“and then I really liked girls.” She wiggled her
eyebrows seductively and Tara started giggling
uncontrollably. </p>

<p>“I kissed Faith once.”</p>

<p>The whole room quieted all of the sudden.</p>

<p>“What?” Willow asked completely taken aback.</p>

<p>Buffy just shrugged. “It was after patrol one night
and we were all, ya know, slayerish and I kissed her.”
Grabbing some popcorn, Buffy quickly shoveled it in
her mouth.</p>

<p>Willow looked at her seriously. “Did you like Faith
that way?” </p>

<p>“No. I mean, I didn’t think about it at the time. I
just thought the kiss was because we where all ‘up’
from the slayage. And than, soon after Faith went
all-bad on us and turned up working for the Mayor… and
I just hated her. So I never really thought about it.
But after graduation, and with Faith in the coma… I
think I was attracted to what she could offer me at
the time. Ya know?” Buffy finally looked at Willow.</p>

<p>“I know.” Willow replied sadly.</p>

<p>“Were you ever attracted to Buffy?” </p>

<p>“Uh?” Willow was utterly thrown by the question and
turned to stare at Tara. </p>

<p>Tara blushed brightly and knew the question revealed
some of her own jealousies and insecurities.</p>

<p>Willow turned to face Tara completely and took both
the blonde’s hands in her own. “I think maybe, at
first. Because she was the only person, well besides
Xander and Jessie that paid any attention to me. And
she was so pretty, something I thought I’d never be.”
Willow reached up to lift Tara’s chin when the blonde
dipped her head downward. “But, no, not really. I love
Buffy. She and Xander are closer to me than my own
parents. They’re family, like you.” Willow paused just
long enough to stroke Tara’s cheek. “I’ll love her
forever, but I’m not attracted to her.”</p>

<p>Tara’s eyes brimmed with tears and Willow leaned over
and kissed her delicately on the lips. </p>

<p>“When did you and Tara first have sex?” </p>

<p>“Buffy!” Willow squealed.</p>

<p>“Hey yea. I wanna know that too.” Anya said continuing
to stuff popcorn into her mouth.</p>

<p>“Not fair. You have to ask a question for everyone.”</p>

<p>“So.” Anya shrugged.</p>

<p>“You can’t change the rules of the game… while we’re
playing.” Willow was totally aghast. </p>

<p>“Don’t care.” Anya said with a huge grin on her face.
“Come on… what was it like?” </p>

<p>“Yeah come on Wills. You’re the one who wanted to be
able to talk about ‘stuff’ with me more often. Well
now’s your chance.”  Buffy grinned wickedly at her
friend.</p>

<p>Willow simply stared at Buffy with her mouth wide
open. “B-Buffy. I can’t tell you that. That’s-that’s
like a-a-a me and Tara thing. How can you ask me
that?” </p>

<p>Anya smirked and Buffy kept grinning at Willow,
neither willing to let the redhead off the hook. </p>

<p>“I-I-I-I… Tara?” Willow hoped her girlfriend would
step in and give her a hand. But when she turned to
face the blonde, she saw that Tara had a bit of a
wicked grin on her face as well. Great, Willow
thought. Probably payback for the kitchen. Jeez!</p>

<p>“Okay Fine.” Willow huffed. “The first time Tara and I
had sex was right after the whole Buffy-Faith body
swap thing.” She crossed her arms on her chest and
pouted. </p>

<p>“So?” </p>

<p>“So what?” Willow was really beginning to regret her
playful suggestion to Buffy earlier in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Soooo how was it?” Buffy asked with wicked curiosity.</p>

<p>Willow simply sat in shock on the couch. Horrified
that her friends would ask her such a thing. Fine, if
they’re gonna be like that. Willow thought with a
grumble.</p>

<p>And before she even thought about what she was saying,
Willow rambled onward. “It was the best thing that
ever happened to me.  Tara has the body of a Goddess.
And for someone who claimed to be a virgin she had a
suspiciously talented tongue and knew how to do things
that I thought only porn stars knew how to do and...”</p>

<p>“Willow!”</p>

<p>Willow cringed at the tone in Tara’s voice and both
Buffy and Anya shot her a ‘you’re in trouble now’
look. </p>

<p>The redhead turned to her girlfriend to see that Tara
was absolutely red from head to toe and was looking at
her like she had two heads. Suddenly realizing what
she’d just said, Willow was mortified. “Tara.” Willow
grabbed for the blonde’s hands and giggled cautiously.
“Oops.” She smiled apologetically and everyone held
their breath waiting to see what Tara would do next. </p>

<p>Tara looked at Willow with a bemused look on her face.
“I have the body of a Goddess?” </p>

<p>Willow smiled broadly and bobbed her head up and down.</p>

<p>
“Exactly how talented a tongue does she have?” Anya
asked through a cheek full of puffy corn.</p>

<p>“Tara’s very talented.” Willow said seriously.</p>

<p>“I bet.” </p>

<p>Something in Anya’s voice made Willow turn at look at
her. “Hey! No looking at my girlfriend like that.” She
pouted.</p>

<p>“What. I’m not doing anything.”</p>

<p>“You’re looking at Tara and I just don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I’m looking at Tara than she’s looking at
Tara.” Anya pointed to Buffy across the table from her
who was just staring at Tara. </p>

<p>“Hey!” Willow said again with a pout. She threw a
protect arm around Tara, and added a leg just for
emphasis. “Mine.” She said.</p>

<p>“Yours.” Tara said softly and ran a finger slowly down
Willow’s cheek. </p>

<p>“Wow.” Buffy said finally coming out of her
stupor-induced stare-fest.</p>

<p>“Okay, game over. Time for bed.” Willow said as she
jumped up from the couch and grabbed Tara’s hand
pulling the other girl along after her. “Night.” Was
all she said as she led Tara towards the stairs.</p>

<p>“Um, goodnight.” Tara barely managed to get out before
Willow dragged her up to the second floor.</p>

<p>“So you think…” </p>

<p>“Oh, I so think.”</p>

<p>Buffy turned to the ex-demon who had a grin on her
face. </p>

<p>“Ya know it’s not fair. I mean, I think we should be
able to watch.”</p>

<p>“Anya!”</p>

<p>“What? We get all turned on by their little show in
the kitchen earlier, than sit here for like the last
hour listening to their sex-capes, and we know damn
well they’re going up their to have sex… I just think
we deserve to see. Ya know?” Anya looked at the slayer
hopefully.</p>

<p>Buffy had to admit, watching Tara and Willow earlier
and listening to them talk about everything they’ve
done together… well she couldn’t help looking up
towards the top of the steps. “I wonder who’s room
they’re in?” Did she say that out loud?</p>

<p>“Why? Is there some way we could watch if they’re in a
certain room?”</p>

<p>Anya seemed way too eager, and Buffy had to admit she
was a bit too eager herself. “Wwweeelll…”</p>

<p>The next thing she knew Anya had grabbed her hand and
was forcing her up the stairs, “Come on. Lets go see
which room they’re in.” </p>

<p>And surprisingly, Buffy followed.</p>
