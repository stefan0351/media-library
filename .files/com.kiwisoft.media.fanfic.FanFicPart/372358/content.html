FIVE</b></p>
<p>Miley pulled her soft blue tee over her head, pulling her hair out and letting it flow over her shoulders and back. She then reached over to the shorts lying next to the sink and slipped them up over her long, tanned legs, the waistband snapping against her skin when she let go. Looking in the mirror, Miley deemed herself decent and left the bathroom retreating quickly to her bedroom.</p>
<p>Her heart lodged itself into her throat as she shut her bedroom door behind her, her eyes glued to the blonde sitting on her bed. Lilly had her head down, her fingers tracing a pattern on the blanket beside her. She'd been mad when she stormed out a few minutes ago – in fact, Miley could clearly remember the front door slamming shut and the resounding echo that had hurt her more than words could.</p>
<p>When had she come back? Why hadn't Miley heard her?</p>
<p>"I thought you left." Miley finally said, not making any movements toward her.</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged and looked up, meeting Miley's eyes. "What kind of friend would I be if I just left you here after what just happened?"</p>
<p>Miley was the one to look away this time, heat flooding her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm sorry for intruding like that. I shouldn't have opened the shower curtain without asking, but <i>God</i>, I've never heard you make a sound like that before and it scared the shit out of me." Lilly explained, "And then I just got so angry because I know that there's something you're not telling us and you've basically been a zombie. I didn't mean to hurt you, Miles."</p>
<p>Miley sat down on the bed next to her. "Yeah, I know. Man, I must have looked like a mess."</p>
<p>"A beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless." Lilly's cheeks were tinted a light pink as she ducked her head shyly.</p>
<p>"You're always doing that - trying to cheer me up with your little rhymes." Miley then bit her lip and then raised a single eyebrow as she truly processed those words. She turned to face her friend, smiling to herself. "You think I'm beautiful?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do, Miles." Lilly said, lifting her head to meet her eyes.</p>
<p>Miley leaned forward and pressed her lips to Lilly's, one of her hands cupping Lilly's cheek while the other quickly made its way beneath the waist band of Lilly's pants. Her fingers were close, so close to where she wanted to be and her fingers barely brushed against Lilly's clit when Lilly's hand clamped down around her wrist and tugged the hand from her shorts. The pressure left Miley's mouth as well, and when she could finally open her eyes, Lilly was standing in front of her.</p>
<p>The look on her face wasn't that of pleasure, but of fright.</p>
<p>"Miley! What the hell was <i>that?</i>"</p>
<p><i>Oh, shit.</i></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"…Look, I'm sorry." Miley pleaded, not for the first time in the past few minutes. She leaned back against the headboard and drew her legs up to her chest and wrapped her long arms around them, resting her chin atop one of them. Her eyes were fixed on Lilly, who had reluctantly sat down at the foot of the bed with her legs crossed Indian-style as she faced Miley and her head down, eyes fixated on her lap.</p>
<p>"Would you mind filling me in on what the hell just happened?" Lilly asked roughly, not lifting her head. "Maybe I'm being dumb, but I have a feeling that this is what's been bothering you."</p>
<p>Miley inhaled slowly, letting the breath back out after a few moments. "You're not being dumb. I've been – I've been having these… these <i>dreams</i>."</p>
<p>Lilly then lifted her head and her eyes locked on Miley's. Miley could feel herself heat up under the blonde's look, but kept eye-contact. "What kind of dreams, Miley?"</p>
<p>"They're… intense and erotic. They're purely sexual." Miley admitted, "The things you do to me in these dreams…" Her eyes now broke the contact and fell to look at her own feet.</p>
<p>"So earlier when you zoned out on the couch…" Lilly cleared her throat, looking mildly uncomfortable. "What was that?"</p>
<p>"It was… the first time I've ever day dreamed about you." Miley confessed, biting down hard on her lower lip. "And last night on the couch, I guess. The only part I can remember from that dream is kissing you. I don't remember it progressing any more than that. Right before you guys came over, however, is a different story…" Miley blushed as she recalled the experience.</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, mostly to herself. "How often does this happen? I mean, how long has this been going on?"</p>
<p>"I so don't want to answer that." Miley groaned, burying her face in her arms.</p>
<p>She felt Lilly move from the end of the bed up toward her. The back of her bed creaked and she tilted her face just barely to see that Lilly was beside her, in very much the same position she had just been in.</p>
<p>"I wish you would." Lilly told her, picking at her thumbnail. She fixed Miley with a stern look. "I think I deserve some answers."</p>
<p>Miley frowned slightly and lifted her head. <i>Fine. </i>"The first one was five months ago, almost six now. At first it wasn't as intense or frequent. Then it just rocketed. Like, one night I didn't have a dream and the next six days I did. But now, I have them every time I fall asleep."</p>
<p>"So you're obviously attracted to me." Lilly muttered, then addressed Miley again. "Are you just attracted to me, or is there something more there?"</p>
<p>"There's a lot more than just <i>something</i>." Miley responded shyly, raising an eyebrow at her friend.</p>
<p>"Okay, no more talking." Lilly said abruptly and tilted her head back against the headboard. "Just… give me a few minutes to process this."</p>
<p>Miley nodded and did as Lilly asked.</p>
<p>"…I don't know what to think." Lilly said finally, "I'm not disgusted, though. I mean, I should be, but you can't help what you dream about." Miley offered a shy smile at Lilly's words. "And it's not like you were going to actually <i>do</i> anything, well, not until today…"</p>
<p>"I swear, Lilly, I thought I had dozed off or something." Miley cut in quickly.</p>
<p>"Is that what we sound like in your dreams?" Lilly wondered. "I kind of imagined something… dirtier. You know, less conversation."</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's like that. Other times we talk and it's so natural that sometimes I don't realize I'm dreaming until you slip your hand down my pants." Miley's eyes widened considerably as she realized what she said. "Um…"</p>
<p>"Is it always just me starting things?" Lilly questioned, frowning slightly.</p>
<p>"Not always…" Miley stretched out, "Okay, yes. Today was the first time I initiated… <i>contact</i>."</p>
<p>Lilly hummed to herself. "Go figure. You finally start something and it's not a dream at all."</p>
<p>Miley rolled her eyes and shrugged, giggling. "Just my luck, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…" Lilly said absently. "Look, Miley… you are my best friend and I love you no matter what. If you need me, definitely call me, but I just need some space for a couple of days, okay?"</p>
<p>Spreading her legs out in front of her, Miley wiggled her toes and focused on them for a moment. Then she turned to Lilly. "Will you still be able to come to the concert on Friday?"</p>
<p>Lilly smiled and nodded. "Of course I will. I wouldn't miss Hannah Montana's birthday bash for the world. She'll be legal soon, you know."</p>
<p>"I do know that." Miley said with a soft smile. She was glad that Lilly seemed to accept what's been bothering her and taking it in stride.</p>
<p>Lilly then crawled off of the bed and leaned down to wrap her arms around Miley in a tight hug. "We'll get past this, Miley. Okay? Just don't keep it to yourself for so long next time. I don't really like zombie-Miley."</p>
<p>"Thanks, buddy." Miley responded and let her go.</p>
<p>For the second time that day, she watched Lilly leave her. This time, her heart didn't hurt so badly.</p>
