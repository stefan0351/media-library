<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 23 -->

<p>The 747 touched down at Gatwick airport in the early hours of the
morning. The British Airways jet disgorged its passengers, including the
Slayer and her friends who emerged from first class.</p>

<p>"Xander, I can't believe you vomited on the floor. In first class, for
heavens sake!" Giles said rather testily.</p>

<p>"Hey! I haven't flown before. Plus that turbulence we hit over
Iceland, well, no man should have to go through that." Xander complained.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you know they have airsickness bags for a reason you know."
Buffy told her friend.</p>

<p>"True, but Xander here thought that were for storing the air line food
that I refused to eat." David informed them.</p>

<p>"Hey! It was a long flight! I might have gotten hungry later on."
Xander protested at the extended pick on Xander session. David rolled his
eyes at the comment.</p>

<p>"Xander, you want to know what a long flight is? Try the Sydney to
London or the Sydney to LA non stop flights. 22 ass numbing, brain damaging
hours. Every minute designed to burn the humanity right out of a person."
informed David. They stopped at the baggage terminal.</p>

<p>"Right, we'll find our luggage. Xander, go find us a couple of taxis."
Giles told him. Xander left in the general direction of the exit. David
looked at his father.</p>

<p>"You are aware that the hotel has a mini bus waiting for us to take us
there?" he asked his father.</p>

<p>"Yes. But Xander doesn't." Giles said, a smile edging from his lips.
David laughed.</p>

<p>"You are a truly evil man, Rupert Giles." David said.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The gang made it to the hotel and checked into their rooms. Giles had
a room to himself which connected to the room that David and Xander shared.
Buffy and Willow shared a room across the hall. David and Xander dumped the
huge pile of luggage into Buffy and Willow's room. Giles entered a moment
later, puffing as he struggled with a pair of bags. Willow and Buffy walked
in after him. Trying to get his breath back, Giles pointed at Xander.</p>

<p>"Next time... you offer... to carry the... girls bags,... count... me
out." Giles told the young man.</p>

<p>"Come on Giles, it's the proper and decent thing to do." Xander smiled
at his revenge for the taxi thing.</p>

<p>"Speaking of decent" David said, indicating to the room. "Girls. You
will notice that there are two single beds which" he grabbed one and tried to
move it. "Cannot be brought together. So you'll just have to cool your
hormones for a few days." David said with a cheeky grin. Willow just looked
at the beds, a coy smile on her face.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Single beds mean that we just have to snuggle together
more closely." Willow said. Buffy looked at the fire place.</p>

<p>"Also that big rug by the fire place has definite possibilities."
Buffy said. David and Xander just stood there, dreamy smiles on their faces
as the images invoked flashed through their minds. Giles just coughed and
spluttered for a bit.</p>

<p>"Right then I'll be in my room were there is no talk of sex." Giles
said turning for his room. David chuckled.</p>

<p>"OK. Why don't we meet down in the lobby in, say, two hours?" David
suggested. They agreed and went into their respective rooms to unpack.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>They all met in the lobby where David informed them what was planned
for the day.</p>

<p>"You guys need to go shopping for some clothes." he told them.</p>

<p>"Why? What kind of clothes?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"For tonight, you'll need dresses for the ball. Dad, Xander, you guys
need to go to this address for a fitting. I've arranged for you have your
clothes tailor made." David said handing over a card with an address on it.
Willow looked at David quizzically.</p>

<p>"Ball? What ball?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"The ball that we are going to tonight. Relax. You guys will have a
blast." he said.</p>

<p>"Hello. Problem. We are just a pair of college students here. How are
we going to afford to pay for said dresses?" asked Buffy. David reached into
his pocket and pulled out 4 credit cards and handed one to each of them.</p>

<p>"Keep these. The credit limit is $750 000 per month and don't worry,
the bill gets settled at the end of each month by someone else." he said to
the disbelieving stares of everyone.</p>

<p>"How? Who?" Giles asked, stunned. David merely smiled.</p>

<p>"Let's just say that I have a very special understanding with a couple
of banks." he told them.</p>

<p>"Ok. Everyone meet back here at 4pm. We will get ready and head off to
the ball around 6. Any questions?" asked David. Xander put his hand up.</p>

<p>"Yeah, just one. Where are you going to be?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Me? I'm going to see a man about a dog." replied David.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Later that day.</p>

<p>"So, we are agreed then gentlemen?" the men around the table nodded
their assent. The man at the head of the table stood and shook David's hand.</p>

<p>"Major, you have got your self a deal. I'll get some copies made and I
give you one tonight at the ball." the man said.</p>

<p>"Thank you sir. It will be a pleasure." David said smiling.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It was 4 o'clock and the gang were in Giles' room discussing the day.
Buffy and Willow had gone on an epic shopping spree. Not only had they bought
ball gowns, but had bought an entire new wardrobe each, with accessories.
Buffy considered that if David was stupid enough to give them credit cards
then it was her duty to use them to the full.</p>

<p>Giles and Xander had been a little more restrained on the credit
cards. Once they finished being measured for their out fits, Giles took
Xander to show some of his old stomping grounds. They too did some clothes
shopping, with Giles making sure that Xander got some decent clothes for a
change and Xander making sure that Giles didn't even look at tweed. They
finished up at Giles' old pub, The Duke Of Kent.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door which was the porter bringing in the
clothes for the ball. Buffy and Willow left to get ready while David helped
Xander and Giles. Giles and Xander could not believe the clothes they had for
the ball.</p>

<p>"We can't wear these!" Giles insisted, indicating to his and Xander's
clothes. Or more rather, uniforms. Giles had the mess dress of a Royal Air
Force Wing Commander while Xander had the mess dress of a United States Army
Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"We can't wear this. We aren't in the military!" Giles hissed at
David. David sighed in frustration.</p>

<p>"Look, the ball is at HM Naval Base Portsmouth. It is easier to blend
in if you are military. That way people will not ask too many questions." he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes. But what about the questions they do ask? Xander and I don't
know the first thing about the military." Giles protested. Xander spoke up.</p>

<p>"Giles, it's cool. I remember all that army guy stuff from Halloween."
Xander said.</p>

<p>"That's all right for you but what about me?" Giles persisted.</p>

<p>"Look, if any one asks anything to do with the Air Force, all you have
to say is that you spent your career in intelligence at GCHQ. Then tell them
that since you retired you have been undertaking research in ancient history.
That way you can start talking about things you know about." David informed
Giles.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what if they keep asking me about what I did at this GCHQ?"
Xander handled that one.</p>

<p>"That's the beauty of it Giles. As soon as you mention intelligence
and GCHQ, it all falls into the category of 'need-to-know'. They don't need
to know so they won't ask anything more." Xander explained. Giles grumbled a
little more but gave up and started to get ready.</p>

<p>When they met the girls to go, it took another ten minutes of
convincing them that it was a good idea. They headed off with only Xander
thinking this was a good idea. Everyone else had reservations about David's
scheme.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>To the general amazement of everyone, they weren't arrested. Instead
they entered the great hall where the ball was in full swing. They wandered
through the crowd until David saw who he was looking for.</p>

<p>"Admiral Michaels, sir. Would you care to meet my guests?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Major McWray." The Admiral said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Admiral, I would like to introduce Wing Commander Rupert Giles, RAF
retired." The Admiral shook Giles' hand.</p>

<p>"A pleasure. So, what did you do in the RAF?" The Admiral asked Giles.
Giles looked at David in a little panic.</p>

<p>"Um.. Intelligence. GCHQ. That kind of thing. Need to know." Giles
said somewhat uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Oh, right you are. Sorry about that. So, what do you do now. If I may
enquire?" asked the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Well, I research ancient history. Kind of a hobby of mine for years."
Giles replied.</p>

<p>"Fascinating." The Admiral turned to Xander. "And who do we have
here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Alexander Harris. United States Army." Xander said.</p>

<p>"Where are you posted?" asked the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Fort Meade." he replied, indicating the US electronic spy agency head
quarters. The Admiral quickly moved to Buffy.</p>

<p>"And who is this lovely lady?" he asked. David answered for her.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers. She's with the NSA." David told him. The Admiral moved
on to Willow, but before the Admiral could say anything Willow smiled and
said;</p>

<p>"Willow Rosenberg, CIA."</p>
