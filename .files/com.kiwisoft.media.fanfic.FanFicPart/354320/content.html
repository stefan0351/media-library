<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 2 -->

<p>Five days had gone by and B'Elanna and Seven could still be found in the
holodeck. The gelpacks that needed to be repaired were repaired, the circuits
that needed to be replaced were replaced, and yet the system was still not
functioning properly. Whenever B'Elanna would ask for the safeties brought
on-line she would get the exit archway to appear and whenever Seven would ask
for a pool of water she would get rain. Unfortunately it took both women three
times of going home soaked to realize that using water as a test parameter was
not such a good idea. It seemed that everything was repaired and operational it
was just that the computer was who decided when and how things would work. It
was still five days later and every crew member that B'Elanna and Seven passed
in the halls wanted to know when things would be fixed so that they could have
their party. Now Mr. Neelix's party was the talk of the ship again thanks to
Seven's surprise. It seemed that word had spread about Seven's 'gift' to the
crew and now everyone was curious as to what the ex-drone had planned but of
course no one wanted to wait for the party. Seven had gotten tired of
explaining the definition of a surprise and so had adopted the catch phrase of
'no comment'.</p>

<p>Both women were now spending even more time together trying to fix the
holodeck within the self imposed time limit of two days time. They were also
avoiding the crew who seemed hell bent on asking questions about the party
(even Naomi and the Captain had tried to interrogate Seven). Either the two
were on the holodeck trying to fix the problem or in cargo bay 2 discussing the
problem. Even though the holodeck was still not operational, Seven being her
usual efficient self, was able to set up the parameters for the program using
her computer in cargo bay 2. The only thing left to complete would be to repair
the holodeck. One morning, while on the holodeck, the two women had an
unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys. How's it coming?&quot; Tom Paris asked as he strolled onto
the holodeck.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not 'coming', Lt.&quot; Seven replied in a clipped voice showing
how little patience she had for him right now.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean what's the hold up Lanna? You're suppose to be the best
engineer in the entire quadrant and you can't even fix this little problem.
You're suppose to be able to fix anything mechanical, well except maybe Seven
over there. No offense.&quot; Tom tried to joke except the other two women were
not laughing.</p>

<p>Tom of course was oblivious to his joke not being funny and missed the low
growl that came from Torres. But Seven didn't miss it and wondered exactly what
the engineer was growling at. Was it because Tom insulted her engineering
skills or was it because Tom had insulted her? The apologetic look Seven got
from B'Elanna answered that question. Perhaps their friendship had progressed
farther than Seven had thought, Seven had found herself hoping.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps, since you two can't seem to figure out the problem, then
maybe Harry and I can give it a try. I mean we are the resident holodeck
experts.&quot; Tom boasted which made B'Elanna rage even more.</p>

<p>That is until Seven placed a comforting hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he is right. We need time to regenerate and having 'a fresh
pair of eyes' might be helpful. I heard the Captain use the phrase.&quot; Seven
explained when she received a questioning glance from Torres.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess you're right. I do need a break and the problem will
still be here when we get back. I don't suppose Tom can do any more damage than
is already done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, I'm still in the room, guys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever. Seven, want to go get a nutritional supplement in the mess
hall?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would enjoy a 'bite to eat'.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven and B'Elanna had picked up the habit of talking like the other because
of all the time they spent together recently. At first everyone thought it was
funny until the novelty of it wore off, at least for everyone except B'Elanna
and Seven. The two left Tom Paris alone to play in his home away from home.</p>

<p>The following morning, Tom had called both Seven and Torres as well as
Janeway to meet him in the holodeck. Janeway of course was the last to arrive
and when she entered she could have sworn she stepped right into WWIV. Tom and
B'Elanna were screaming at each other while Seven tried to keep a grip on the
Klingon's waist for fear that she might actually kill Paris if she let go.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; The Captain called for order immediately. &quot;What is
going on here? Tom, you first since you did call this meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I called all of you here to tell you that I fixed the holodeck
programming and Lanna here wants to rip my head off because I fixed something
she couldn't.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a good thing that Seven was still holing onto the engineer because
now she was really determined to kill Paris.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt.! That's enough. Now I want your side of the story without you
killing anyone in the process.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna finally calmed down but not because of the Captain's orders or any
strengthening of her will but rather because of the warm, calm, comforting arms
she was wrapped up in. Even though she was no longer struggling, those arms
never left her waist and B'Elanna was thanking every god she could thing of for
small miracles.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll start from the beginning Captain since Lt. Paris seemed to have
left out a few details. You see, when the holodeck was damaged so were some of
the gelpacks involved in the functioning of the holodeck. The gelpacks are what
connect the holomatrix to the main computer. Without that connection we would
only end up with two dimensional pictures in the holodeck instead of the three
dimensional interactive programs we run. In order to repair the gelpacks we had
to shut down the link and since then we haven't been able to get it functioning
properly again. The link was reestablished and we are able to run three
dimensional programs but the information comes through that link all jumbled up.
If you asked the computer for rain it would give you fire, if you asked it for
snow it would give you a sunny day. We tested the gelpacks and the systems
within the holodeck and they all check out fine, so we assumed the problem had
to do with the link itself. The wires must have gotten crossed somewhere along
the line within the gelpacks, so to speak. We spent the better part of the week
trying to narrow down exactly where the lines got crossed so we could fix them.
Instead, helm boy, here, decides to fly in here and do a quick fix. He switched
the link from the designated gelpacks for the holodeck to gelpacks that are
considered standby gelpacks which haven't been used in ages. My problem with
that is that he didn't even bother to check to see if the gelpacks were in good
working order. If one thing goes amiss then it could damage the whole system
even more. Not to mention that this is only a quick fix. I'm not even sure if
those gelpacks can withstand the stress created by the extensive use of the holodeck.
They could just as easily burn out creating more problems than before.&quot;
B'Elanna explained through clenched teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;I know it's a quick fix but that's all we need right now just so we
can have this Christmas party. Everyone is dying to celebrate and I for one
don't want to tell them to wait for you to fix a problem that can be fixed at
another time.&quot; Paris whined.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, enough. B'Elanna you check the holodeck computer and find out if
it is functioning within normal parameters. Tom, thanks for the help but I do
believe that you are needed on the bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom left disappointed that he didn't get the credit he deserved for fixing
the holodeck and saving the Christmas party. B'Elanna, on the other hand, went
over to the computer console and began running a level ten diagnostic on the
system.</p>
