<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 1 -->

<p>Cordelia slowly made her way up the steps onto the Summer's front  porch, until both of her feet came to rest on the bare straw mat that  lay in front of the door.  She looked down in-between her feet and  smiled, people in L.A. still had ones that read: Welcome.  Looking  back up, she confirmed that the doorbell was indeed in the same place  she'd last seen it and extended her hand to ring the bell.  But just  before her finger reached the black button, she stopped, her arm  merely hovering centimeters away.  It had been so long since she had  been there, not that she used to be at Buffy's house everyday  braiding the Slayer's hair and helping her carve stakes, but even she  could tell it felt different.  It had only been a few years, but they  hadn't been short and so much had changed.  And, as her hand hovered  by the bell, she wondered if anything would be the same.</p>

<p>"I can't answer the door if you don't ring the bell," said a soft  voice from behind Cordelia.  The brunette turned her head around  slowly recognizing the voice immediately as Buffy's.  Her tone was  flatter, softer than Cordelia was used to hearing from the blonde,  but it was unmistakably Buffy.</p>

<p>Now facing the blonde she looked at her intently, and with a slight  smile moved her finger the last centimeter, pressing down on the  black button, filling the silence of the porch with a faint buzzing.</p>

<p>"You cut your hair," Buffy said making her way onto the porch and  reaching for the door handle.</p>

<p>"You've grown yours out," Cordelia responded eyeing the blonde as she  pushed through the now open door, only looking back briefly to make  sure the brunette was following her before continuing further into  the house.</p>

<p>"Can I get you something to drink?" Buffy asked carelessly tossing  her jacket over the back of one of the chairs around the kitchen  table as she made her way to the sink.  "We've got every pop known to  mankind, and…apparently soy milk."</p>

<p>"I'm fine," Cordelia responded softly, unconsciously matching Buffy's  tone.  "Thanks," she continued observing the blonde as she nodded to  indicate she'd heard the brunette then reach for a glass for  herself.  </p>

<p>The brunette hadn't really been sure to expect when she saw Buffy for  the first time, but from the way she was feeling having finally met  her again, she knew she hadn't been expecting this.  She supposed  that considering all that had happened to Buffy over the past year,  hell over the past couple of weeks, that the blonde seemed to be  doing rather well.  Sure she wasn't exactly a ray of shine, but  logically one couldn't expect her to be.  She had lost her mother,  nearly lost her sister, died, was banished to a hell dimension, and  then suddenly brought back to life.  That was pretty rough deal; it  would've left anyone feeling a bit out of sorts.  It would have been  insanity to expect her to be the same old Buffy.  But as Cordelia  watched her pour herself a glass of water, she realized that she had  secretly been expecting to see the old Buffy.  That somehow she had  just assumed that Buffy would've bounced back like always, and when  they met they would've insulted each others clothing and it would  have been like the good old days.  But the moment she arrived at the  house, and saw the unkempt lawn, the shoddily patched up window, and  the overhanging tree branches she knew.  She knew that it wasn't  going to be like the good old days, and standing in the center of the  Summer's kitchen watching the Slayer watch her; she suddenly realized  that she had no idea what to do.</p>

<p>"Have we run out of small talk?" Buffy asked snapping Cordelia out of  her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Where's Dawn?" Cordelia asked ignoring the blonde's question.  The  fact was that there was plenty to talk to about, too much to talk  about, and there was no way that they would talk about it.  They  could talk about how Buffy looked like shit, they could talk about  how the house looked like it had been ransacked, they could talk  about how she had mind numbing visions, or how she was no longer able  to sleep through the night.  They could talk about what hell was  like, about how it felt to feel like the powers that be were  punishing you for trying to do your best.  They could talk about what  it felt like to have no life, to feel like a plague that would infect  and destroy anyone who got close to you.  They could talk about how  they would sigh in relief as night fell.  They could talk about  having no parents and being on their own.  They could talk about a  lot of things, but they wouldn't.  </p>

<p>"School," Buffy responded.  "Apparently the teacher's LIKE her.   Heard that's what happens when you attend," she continued pulling out  a chair and sitting down.  "You can sit down you know, we don't have  a lot of chairs left but the ones that are here are fully functional."</p>

<p>"What happened?  To the house I mean?" Cordelia asked pulling out a  chair and sitting down gingerly, still uncertain of the structural  soundness of the object in question.</p>

<p>"Crystal eating, fish demon," Buffy responded nonchalantly.  "Why are  you here?"</p>

<p>"I had a vision," Cordelia responded settling onto the chair more  securely.  Buffy's segue into finding out what the hell she was doing  back in Sunnydale hadn't exactly been subtle, but she was glad for  the change of subject.  She could talk business.  "I know that sounds  like I eat granola and sleep on bubble wrap, but two years ago…"</p>

<p>"I know about the visions," Buffy interjected cutting Cordelia  off.  "Angel told me.  He said you almost died from them."</p>

<p>"That was different," Cordelia, responded both surprised and not  surprised that she had come up during any conversations the two of  them had had.  "Most of the time they're just excruciatingly painful,  not lethal."</p>

<p>Buffy let out a bark of dark laughter.  "Don't you love being  special?" she asked looking up and over at Cordelia, her lips  twitching upwards, but not quite smiling.</p>

<p>"Doesn't all suck," Cordelia responded seriously meeting her  gaze.  "But," she continued smiling slightly, "when it does decide to  bend you over it works you with a ten foot pole."</p>

<p>Buffy's lips twitched again at this, this time forming what could be  recognized as a smile, but her expression reverted back to the mask  of indifference that it had been since Cordelia first turned on the  porch to face her.</p>

<p>"What could you have possibly seen that would bring you here?"  Buffy  asked resting her elbow on the table boredly and propping her head in  her hands.</p>

<p>"Me.  Here," Cordelia responded, blinking rapidly in surprise when  Buffy started to laugh.  "That's funny?" the brunette asked wondering  if perhaps she should have asked Angel to go into a bit more detail  about Buffy's mental state before entering a confined, deserted space  with her.</p>

<p>"Strangely, yes," Buffy replied standing up and heading for the  door.  "Feel like taking a walk?" she asked looking back at Cordelia  briefly.</p>

<p>"I guess so," Cordelia responded seeing Buffy pick up her jacket and  knowing that Buffy was going for one whether she went or not.</p>

<p>"I'm not really a fan of confined spaces right now," Buffy continued  as Cordelia stood up to follow her.  "Can't imagine why," she went on  as they stepped out of the house and she closed the door.  "Must have  had something to do with the coffin I used to play in as a child."</p>

<p>"Morbid much?" Cordelia asked as they stepped down the steps.</p>

<p>"Seems so.  But, I'm getting the impression that `being re-animated  from death' humor has kind of jumped the shark," Buffy responded  turning off of the driveway and onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"I think it has a certain charm to it," Cordelia responded sticking  her hands in her pockets as they made their way down the street.  "I  get a lot of drop dead's in L.A. … you know, from cabbies, and after  my so close to death I knew what he had lunch experience, I liked to  respond, been there done that still waiting on the rain check,"  Cordelia continued glancing over at the blonde.  "But you're right, I  think that it really is an acquired taste."</p>

<p>Buffy smirked but said nothing as they cut across the street and  headed downtown.</p>

<p>"You know," the Slayer started a moment later.  "If I wasn't so sure  that you were here to tell me something's going to kill me again, I'd  say that it was good to see you." Cordelia smiled and shook her head.  Now that the extreme awkwardness  had worn off, she found herself thinking that it was kind of nice to  see Buffy too.</p>

<hr>

<p>"They didn't really give me much with this one.  I don't know, maybe  I couldn't see more because it has to do with me, or maybe they were  just feeling particularly bitchy last night, I don't know.  So, what  I'm trying to say, apparently taking the scenic route to it, is that  I don't know what's coming; I don't when it's coming, or what it  wants.  All I know is that it is coming, it'll be here sometime, and  when it finds you I'm there with you," Cordelia related moving the  spoon around her coffee, watching as the brown liquid swirled around  and around in the hideously oversized cup.</p>

<p>"You do realize that you've been of absolutely no help," Buffy  replied staring out the window.  Ooh, another mysterious evil, that  was unexpected.  The blonde sighed and brought her hand up to rub at  her temples tiredly.  Another threat to the survival of the world,  how May of the powers, twice in one year wasn't she the lucky lass.  </p>

<p>"I hoping that more will come later," Cordelia related finally  placing her spoon on the saucer.  "That happens sometimes, like a  mini-series only usually without Joanna Kerns."</p>

<p>"Usually?" the blonde asked glancing at her companion.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she sometimes pops up.  After Growing Pains ended she sold her  soul to Kalshar and tends to pop up in ritual sacrifice visions,"  Cordelia responded.  "I love her robes though, it's always a  surprise."</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"It's Calvin Klein, he's Rashtazar's servant on earth and Rash and  Kal are really tight, so Joanna's got a whole specialized line of  bloodstain resistant poly-cotton blend, doubled stitched robes,"  Cordelia continued.  "Martha's really bitter about the arrangement,  she has to wear smocks."</p>

<p>"What you just said," Buffy responded once Cordelia had finished. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordelia responded watching with a frown as Buffy pushed her  untouched plate away.</p>

<p>"That was more depressing than dying," Buffy continued with a sigh.</p>

<p>Cordelia watched Buffy for a moment after the Slayer spoke.  She wore  weariness over her face like glitter make-up, the dark bags under  hers eyes only accentuating the hollowness of her eyes, and the  gauntness of her cheeks.  She was getting the impression that right  now Buffy would have considered pretty much anything more depressing  than dying, and that confused Cordelia as much as it worried her.</p>

<p>"You're wrong you know," the ex-cheerleader responded a moment later,  her tone completely serious.  "If you think that's more depressing  than dying, then you need to see Fred's wardrobe," she continued in  the same tone.  "Everyone thinks that chiffon went out of style with  asbestos, but the bitch is back and I have to work in the same  building as it.  I mean, imagine trying to convince the bank that you  actually live in Spain so that they won't foreclose on everything and  your shoes, with the knowledge that mere meters above your head lives  a sea-foam chiffon chemise."</p>

<p>"You're right," Buffy said looking over at her.  "That is horribly  depressing."</p>

<p>And as Cordelia looked over at Buffy she could see that the woman  seemed to look even worse, and realized that her little story hadn't  helped matters.  "Of course we have to look on the bright side," the  brunette continued a moment later.</p>

<p>"What?  Even chiffon disintegrates with time?" Buffy asked quirking  an eyebrow at the brunette.</p>

<p>"No," Cordelia replied shaking her head.  "Maybe that's why I was  sent here, to tell that story, so that when our mystery monster  arrives, all we have to do is throw a chiffon camisole over it, and  it'll die of shame," she continued in a conspirital whisper, pleased  to see Buffy smile and shake her head in response.</p>

<p>"Come on," Buffy said standing up a moment later.  "I have to go pick  up Dawn."</p>

<p>"Why, are her legs broken?" Cordelia asked standing up nonetheless.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy responded as they headed for the door.  "It's just that… before…well before when Glory was loose I got used to picking her up  and…it feels normal," she continued pushing out into the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Normal," Cordelia repeated as she joined Buffy on the  sidewalk.  "What's that again?"</p>

<hr>

<p>"This is it," Buffy said as they stopped just outside the doors to  The Magic Box.  Dawn had been ecstatic to see Cordelia, for some  reason the younger girl had always thought that Cordelia was all that  and a bag of chips, and much to Buffy's relief Dawn had immediately  begun to engage the other brunette in conversation from the moment  they saw each other.</p>

<p>"Fresh coat of paint," Cordelia said turning around to face  Buffy.  "That's new for this part of town," the brunette continued.   Buffy had been silent since they'd picked Dawn up and while she had  been entertained by the smaller Summer's girl, she couldn't help but  worry about Buffy at the same time.  Despite the blonde's statement  that she had wanted to pick Dawn up because it seemed normal, and the  amazing sacrifice she had made the girl, from what Cordelia could see  Buffy didn't seem all that interested in her.  She'd barely greeted  the girl when they arrived at the school, and as soon as Dawn had  started talking to her Buffy had moved ahead of them, seemingly  unaware of their presence for the past twenty minutes.  </p>

<p>"Anya's in charge of the shop now…even though Giles is back," Dawn  interjected into the silence that followed Cordelia's  statement.  "The place has got a lot of cool stuff in it, but Anya  employs a strict `you break it, you bought it' policy, so I'd be  careful about what you touch," the younger girl continued.  "Xander's  still paying off the Hhasperas hide he spilled Coke on."</p>

<p>"You know what they say," Cordelia responded smirking at Dawn as  Buffy opened the door to the store. "Retail, it's not a profession,  it's a way of life."</p>

<hr>

<p>"No really, they're glad to see you," Dawn whispered to Cordelia as  the occupants of the shop continued to stare at her blanketing the  room in an unnatural silence.  The moment they had spotted her all  activity immediately ceased and everyone began to stare at her like  she'd just burned a Harry Potter book.  All except for the blonde  girl sitting beside Willow who just looked confused.  Cordelia looked  over at the youngest Summers' girl unconvinced.  "Really," Dawn  insisted.  "We just don't get a lot of visitors."</p>

<p>"It's a shop," Cordelia replied with a sigh, watching as Dawn turned  and looked at the rest of them imploringly.  "Well," Cordelia  muttered walking further into the shop.  "This is going to be a  horribly awkward afternoon," she continued coming to a stop at the  bottom of the stairs, watching idly as Anya stepped closer to Xander  and Willow whispered something to the confused blonde girl.</p>

<p>"Oh," Tara gasped a moment later in understanding.  "She doesn't seem  evil," she whispered to Willow in a voice that wasn't quite as soft  as she thought it was.</p>

<p>Cordelia turned around and smiled at the shy blonde girl before  turning her attention to the redhead sitting beside her.  "Willow I'm  hurt," the brunette began.  "If this is because I inadvertently  called you a big `ol lesbo, I didn't mean anything by it."</p>

<p>"You can't have Xander back.  He's mine now, I've carved our initials  into various objects and surrounded them by hearts," Anya said  speaking up before Willow could respond to Cordelia's comment.</p>

<p>"Okay," Cordelia responded clapping her hands together.  "With that  taken care of why don't we just skip any and all attempts at small  talk and I'll just get straight to the point."</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia slipped out of the living room quietly making her way to the  kitchen.  Peeking inside and seeing that the room was empty she  turned back around to head up the stairs when she noticed that the  front door was ajar.  Walking over she nudged the door open a  fraction more and saw who she had been looking for.</p>

<p>She had noticed that Buffy had disappeared from the gathering some  half hour before but hadn't been able to get out of the room before  then.  She had noticed the blonde get increasingly quite and pensive  as the day wore on, and by the time the Slayer had removed herself  from the company of her friends Cordelia would have been forced to  describe her behavior in the afternoon as positively cherry in  comparison.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind her she moved to sit next to the Slayer, her  mind still trying to wrap around all that she had witnessed today.   Sunnydale had become a far more complicated place since she had left,  and they had all become far more complicated people.  Everything was  tense and off-kilter, dull and gray.  They talked to each other  without saying anything, they frowned at behavior but looked the  other way, they smiled but it never reached their eyes.  She felt  like she had entered some kind of bizarro world where everyone looked  the same, and sounded the same, but there was something just a little  wrong about them.  Their hair was parted in the wrong way, or one of  their arms was shorter than the other.  These were the people that  never ran, that bit their thumb at death, that mocked the undead.  They were the humble heroes.  And now, well now they weren't.</p>

<p>"When I woke up, after the incident with the never-ending visions, I  told Angel what I had seen.  And he sat there quietly, looking  pensive and doing that thing with his brow.  You know, the furrowing  thing that makes them go all scrunch-y.  And I asked him if hell was  like because I couldn't see how things could possibly be worse.  And  he was pensive for a minute; you know high octane brooding, before  telling me that there weren't words in the English vocabulary to  describe what hell was like.  He said that on earth there was good  along with the bad, and that once you had been to a place where good  was distant echo the earth was like … well he was glad to be back,"  Cordelia finished finally taking her eyes off of her shoes and  turning to face Buffy who was staring out into the dark of the street  in front of them.  "You're not."</p>

<p>"I'm not what?" Buffy asked her attention still focused on something  in the distance that Cordelia couldn't see, that Cordelia wasn't even  sure was there to see.</p>

<p>"You don't seem glad to be back," the brunette responded keeping her  eyes trained on the side of the Slayer's face.  That had been bugging  her since they had first seen each other, a feeling that had gotten  worse throughout the day.  Buffy was miserable, she could see it, and  she knew that the Scoobies could see it too.  Everybody saw it, but  nobody talked about it.  It didn't make sense, she was out of hell,  she should have been getting better but she wasn't and everyone was  afraid to ask why.</p>

<p>"I was tortured for months in an unimaginable hell dimension,  surrounded by nothing but fire and agony.  The only human sounds that  I heard were my own tortured screams, and the only way to bare the  pain without going complete insane was to shut down, to stop feeling  and lose the pain in nothingness," Buffy began, her monotone voice  soft and hollow.  She had practiced these words and they fell out of  her mouth effortlessly.  "I don't seem glad because I'm not…I'm  learning how to feel again," she concluded with a deep sigh.  She was  so tired, but she knew she couldn't sleep.  To sleep was to remember  so it hurt too much to sleep.</p>

<p>"That was almost convincing," Cordelia responded a moment later,  turning her gaze out into the darkness as well.  She wondered how  many times Buffy had practiced that to make it sound so effortless.   The words they raged, but there was no fire.  Who says they want to  feel with no feeling?  "There's just one thing," the brunette  continued, "if you want to be warm again, why are you are you running  away into the dark?"</p>

<p>Buffy brought her head into her hands, rubbing her temples slowly.   Of all the people to call her out, she hadn't thought it would  Cordelia.  But now that the brunette was there, it seemed to make  perfect sense, why not Cordelia.  Hadn't the woman always called  people on their shit before?  "It hurts less out here," the Slayer  said finally turning to face the other woman.  "It's not warm in  there," she continued letting her gaze drift back into the  darkness.  "It's suffocating."</p>

<p>Cordelia turned her head to face Buffy once more upon hearing the  blonde's response.  She couldn't say that she was surprised by the  blonde's answer considering what she had seen throughout the day.  It  was a curious statement to be sure, but these were curious  circumstances. </p>

<p>"I don't expect you to get it," Buffy continued in Cordelia's  silence.  And she meant it, how could the brunette possibly know what  she was talking, how could she expect another to know when she barely  understood herself.  How could Cordelia whom she hadn't seen in three  years, had barely interacted with on anything more than a superficial  level, and who had only been in town for eleven hours possibly  understand what she meant when the people that lived with her, the  people that loved her, hadn't figured it out. </p>

<p>"You don't feel like you can be yourself," the brunette said softly  as she watched the Slayer, images and sounds from the day flooding  back to her.  The Scoobies furtive glances towards the blonde, the  strained jokes and smiles, the constant inquires about how Buffy was  feeling, the worried and somehow guilty glances sent her way when  they thought she wasn't looking.  "You're trying to be okay for them,  but you're not okay."</p>

<p>"They brought me back, they were so happy.  I can't be happy and I  can't tell them that," Buffy responded looking at Cordelia with a  touch of surprise.  A touch of surprise was all she was able to get  into her expression, but in reality she hadn't expected Cordelia to  say anything half as insightful as she had.  "The only person I've  been able to talk to since … coming back is Spike, and it's not at  all possible to be happy about that," she finished her head tilting  back lazily so that she could see the stars above her.</p>

<p>"I know," Cordelia started a moment later.  "I know we were never  bosom buddies, and that there was a time when I actively tried to  make your life as difficult as a could in my own little way…but since  then, I've come to understand a fraction of what it is that you have  to deal with and how amazingly strong you really are…and always have  been.  And if you'd like someone to talk to besides The Neutered  Dead, I'd be more than happy to listen.  I'm good at that, and of  course also giving my opinion afterwards," Cordelia finished offering  Buffy a friendly smile before standing up.  From her numerous chats  with Angel she had learned that this was the best time in a  conversation to let the subject ruminate over what had been said,  therefore allowing them to come to the conclusion that she, as  always, was right.  She had, after all, gotten quite good at having  these types of chats with the emotionally retarded.  Hell, if she  could get Angel to open up, one more talk with Buffy and she'd have  the girl spilling her guts – in a good, and helpful way that is.</p>

<p>"Cordelia," Buffy said softly looking up at the brunette, surprised  at the tightening she felt in her stomach when the brunette had stood  up to go.  Anxiousness, that was old, she hadn't felt that it quite  some time.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" the ex-cheerleader responded looking down at the blonde.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to inform you," Buffy began desperately trying to think of  something to say that would get the brunette to stay for a while  longer, "that you didn't make anything difficult.  In fact I found  you rather refreshing in an extremely annoying sort of way," the  Slayer went on, her lips twitching up a little as she anticipated the  brunette's offended and hopefully protracted response.    </p>

<p>"Really?" Cordelia asked moving to lean against the porch railing  before returning her gaze to Buffy's.  "So you were just pretending  to hate my tell it like it is policy?"</p>

<p>"No, I really did hate it.  I'm just a big enough person to admit,  that it came in handy from time to time," Buffy responded watching  the other woman pushed off of the railing as if preparing to go once  more.  "And," she continued taking a deep breath, "to ask, that is to  say that if you're wouldn't be totally opposed to the idea … or in  other words if you think that it might be agreeable to you…"</p>

<p>"Do you want me to stay out here with you?" Cordelia asked cutting  the blonde off with a knowing grin.  "Normally I would've let you  finish, but I want to get to bed sometime before the sun rises so I  thought it best to take charge of the situation."</p>

<p>"I see you still haven't signed up for those tact lessons," Buffy  replied smiling as Cordelia settled back down beside her on the  steps.  It was strange feeling for her lately to want any company at  all, and an even stranger feeling to want Cordelia's.  But it was a  feeling that didn't immediately feel like it was shredding her heart,  so she meant to hold on to it for as long as possible.</p>

<p>"Of course not," Cordelia exclaimed proudly.  "I wanted to be an  actress," she continued in a grand tone before smiling  depreciatively.  "You'd be surprised how much social consciousness  doesn't help you in the `Wood.  If you think Sunnydale's bad, you  haven't seen anything until you've been to a meet and greet mixer."</p>

<p>"Horrifying?" Buffy asked with a genuine touch of interest that  didn't go unnoticed by Cordelia.  </p>

<p>The brunette smiled.  "Let me tell you a story…"</p>
