<P><B>capitulo ocho. aqui esta! (translation: chapter eight. here it is!)</B></P><P>You know what sucks? Having an extremely vivid sex dream, then waking up next to the person you just had sex with in said dream. Wanna know how I know? Because it just happened to me.</P><P>One second, Lilly and I are all hot and naked and sweaty and rubbing all over each other and panting like dogs, and the next, I jolt awake and see her sleeping peacefully right next to me.</P><P>Talk about awkward.</P><P>Although I'm still not for sure on the whole lesbian thing. I refuse to accept it. I've thought it, just to myself (because duh, who would be listening to my thoughts?), but I will not say it out loud, and I will not accept it as the truth. Lilly's a lesbian, that's fine. Oliver's a fairy gay queen, that's cool. But Miley Ray Stewart is not, cannot be, a lesbian. It just is not happening. Nope. Nuh-uh. No fucking way.</P><P>"Mmmm." I heard Lilly make some kind of contented moaning noise and glanced over, watching her sleeping figure. Ah-ha, it seems I'm not the only one with a sex dream. I wonder who it is Lilly's fantasizing about. Based on Oliver's comment two weeks ago, which has still been ringing in my head, I'd say Melissa London. But honestly, I just don't even understand how anyone can <I>be with </I>Melissa. She has headgear. How does that work during making out?</P><P>"Miley." It's the same tone of voice as when she moaned, almost making my name sound like that. A deep seductive purr of a moan, with my name.</P><P>No fucking way is she having a sex dream about me. That would just amp this whole sharing a bed bit up to a whole different level of awkward.</P><P>"Oh, God." There she goes again. You know, this is getting ridiculous. Lilly being a lesbian is all fine and dandy with me, but her having a sex dream about me? Unacceptable.</P><P><I>A little hypocritical, Miley, don't you think?</I></P><P>Whoa, what the hell was that? Was that my...conscience? You mean I actually have one of those? It's never happened before. I never had a sense of right or wrong. What the fuck is happening to me? I blame Lilly. It's all her fault. I'm losing my sense of self because of her.</P><P>Okay, we all know how well water on the face worked last time, but I think she needs it again. Not just to wake her up, or because I need to get revenge for her inadvertantly changing me; it just sounds like her body, and overimaginative mind, need a little cooling off.</P><P>So, off I go, headed for the bathroom once more to refill that water cup and throw the cold freshness on her yet again. This time, though, it's a different reaction.</P><P>"Ohmygod, that's cold!" she yelped, wiping her face off. "Again, Miles? Are you serious?"</P><P>"One: No nicknames. Let's just nip that in the butt right now. Two: It sounded like you needed a little cooling off."</P><P>She looked really nervous. "What...What are you talking about?"</P><P>"You know exactly what I'm talking about. Get dressed. I know how much you hate being late."</P><P>...</P><P>The car ride to school was beyond awkward. Lilly figured out quite quickly-she's a smart girl-that I knew what she was dreaming about. She, however, has no idea I was dreaming the same thing. Thus, creating an awkward atmosphere on our way to school, even with Oliver as a non-stop talking buffer.</P><P>I couldn't get out of the car fast enough when Lilly finally parked. Oliver hadn't shut up since the second he'd gotten in the car. I think Lilly may have called him while I was in the shower this morning to tell him of her dream and how I knew, which means he was on buffer duty. Yay for those who need quiet in the mornings, ie: me.</P><P>Then, at lunch, both Oliver and Lilly were nowhere to be found. I looked for them for a brief moment, realized they weren't around, and sat with my old friends who looked at me oddly. Was that disappointment I felt at my two gay friends' absences?</P><P>"So...uhh...what's been up with you?" Laine asked.</P><P>"What do you mean?" I replied, taking a bite out of my pizza.</P><P>Laine twirled a strand of her chin-length, bright pink hair (almost the color of my highlights) and popped her gum. "I mean, why have you been hanging out with the freaks?"</P><P>"The freaks?"</P><P>"Yeah. You know, Queen Fairy and King Butch."</P><P>"First of all, Lilly's not even close to being butch. She's way more of a femme."</P><P>Amanda, with her long blonde hair and black streaks, looked disgusted. "You're speaking their lingo now?"</P><P>I chose to ignore her ignorant comment. "Second of all, they're my friends. And don't think you can sit there and act all high and mighty and judge them. In case you haven't noticed, we're all freaks. Us, more so than them. Look in a mirror."</P><P>I got up, feeling completely and royally pissed, and stalked off to find Lilly and Oliver. They had to be around here somewhere.</P><P>...</P><P>Turns out, no, they didn't have to be around here somewhere. Trust me, I checked. I checked all the girls, and boys, restrooms, and they weren't in there. FYI: If you're hott enough, guys won't care if you bust in to their bathrooms. Unless they have a small dick. Then they get all insecure, so they act really fuckin' pissed and yell at you to compensate for their size, or lack there of.</P><P>Finally, the lunch bell rang, signalling us all to go back to whatever class we were in. After that, the day flew by, and before I knew it, I was in my last class of the day. With Lilly.</P><P>"Hey, where were you?" I asked her as soon as I'd crossed the threshold and taken the seat she'd saved for me, right next to her.</P><P>"I had to take care of some things for the GSA. We're having an AIDS Awareness Rally and I wanted to finalize all the plans."</P><P>"Why did you have to do all that stuff?"</P><P>"Because I'm the president."</P><P>So many things I never would've guessed about her. She continued to surprise me.</P><P>"It's not like you missed me, anyway. You're always complaining about how you have to eat with us."</P><P>I frowned. And she thought she knew me so well. "Of course, on the outside I complain, just to keep my rep. But on the inside, I look forward to every lunch we spend together!" I put my fake sincere voice on and bat my eyelashes at her, my hands coming together in the center of my chest.</P><P>"Ugh, shut up. You're so annoying." She shoved my shoulder.</P><P>"Hah, yeah, that's why you had a sex dream about me last night."</P><P>The two girls in front of us turned around and gawked. "What're you looking at? Don't be jealous 'cause the most action you get is that ninety-nine cent vibrator you bought at the dollar store. Go ahead, turn around." They did not look very pleased, but nonetheless, turned back around.</P><P>Two guys sitting behind us leaned forward and leered. "Hey, how about tonight I come over to your place and shake things up a bit?"</P><P>"How about you stay at your place, where I'm sure you and your hand will shake things up quite enough for you," I retorted, glaring at him.</P><P>His friend guffawed at him, punching him on the shoulder. "Dude, that dyke totally just told you off!"</P><P>"Dude, shut the fuck up!"</P><P>They both leaned back in their seats and wouldn't even let their gazes cross our paths again. I looked over to Lilly, who seemed slightly amused by all this, yet still somewhat troubled. "What's wrong? Was I not good?"</P><P>"Miley, cut it out. It's not like I intentionally had that dream."</P><P>"Ah-ha, but according to Sigmund Freud, our dreams reflect thoughts and desires that our conscience won't acknowledge in our awake state. So secretly, somewhere deep inside you, you want me."</P><P>"Now you're just full of yourself. It's embarrassing enough as it is, so just shut up."</P><P>"Aw, come on. It's not that big of a deal. I just like raggin' on you for it."</P><P>"Why? Why can't you just drop it?"</P><P>"Because you're cute when you're humiliated." Oh my fucking gosh. I cannot believe I just said that. The words just spilled out of my mouth, like I couldn't even control it. Like Lindsay Lohan's fucking word vomit in that dumbass movie with all those hott girls.</P><P>Damn it! There it goes again! I'm so fucked.</P><P>"Cute?" she inquired, tilting her head to the side.</P><P>I hesitated, fishing for a clever response. I had none. "You know what I meant."</P><P>"That I'm cute?"</P><P>"Now who's the one that won't shut up?"</P><P>Mr. Hapton saved me from further word purge by starting class. "Okay, settle down. Today, we'll be talking about enzymes and substrates, so everyone put on your thinking caps and listening ears and pay attention. There might just be a pop quiz on this tomorrow. Hint, hint."</P><P>Oh joy.</P><P>...</P><P>So, as we were sitting in Lilly's car on the way home, I realized that her putting together a rally for the GSA didn't explain where Oliver was during lunch.</P><P>"Oliver?" I ask, "Where were you at lunch?"</P><P>He seemed to not want to answer. "I was uhh...Well, I was...um..."</P><P>"Just spit it out, Clay Aiken."</P><P>"Fine! I was with my new boyfriend!"</P><P>Lilly and I gasped simultaneously. I'm guessing she didn't know either. "Who? Who is this boy?" Lilly exclaims.</P><P>"Robert Lake."</P><P>"The <I>football quarterback</I>?" I say in disbelief.</P><P>"Yes! But you can't tell anybody! He...He isn't out yet!"</P><P>Lilly is still speaking above the average decibal. "I'll say! Oliver, I can't believe you're dating the <I>football quarterback</I>! I thought he was dating Minnie Shrider, head cheerleader! That's how it's supposed to work, in case you didn't know! Although I don't know how anyone couldn't."</P><P>"He was, but they broke up a month ago."</P><P>"So how long has this been going on?" I had to know. This was the juiciest gossip I'd heard in forever.</P><P>"A month."</P><P>"What, so he broke up with Minnie because he'd found that he liked tackling those football oafs more than he should have?" Lilly looked more appalled then I'd thought she would. It's not like she's a homophobe. Though, wouldn't that be the irony to top all ironies?</P><P>"Come on, you know it's not like that."</P><P>"It's exactly like that. You remember how it was for me. I stopped going to the beach for a year until I could sort out what I was feeling."</P><P>"Really?" I interjected, "Lilly, you stopped going to the beach for a whole year, just so you wouldn't have to look at bikini-clad girls?"</P><P>"Look, it's different for everyone, the whole discovery phase. Sometimes, you just want to overanalyze everything ad nauseam, like Oliver and I. Or sometimes, you know from the time that you're five years old that you only wanna play doctor with Lauren, not Luke. Or, sadly, sometimes, you just deny it completely and hope the feelings go away." That's me. "I knew they were there. I just wanted to figure out what they were, what they meant, and why I was having them. The last thing I needed was to be distracted by some girl with 34C breasts strutting my way."</P><P>"Geez, Lilly, could you be any more graphic?" Oliver sounds repulsed.</P><P>"Sure, I could, but I don't think it's something you want to listen to."</P><P>"I'd really rather not."</P><P>"That's what I thought."</P><P>I wasn't paying attention. My mind was still on that very vivid image of a girl with 34C breasts strutting my way.</P><P><B>so there you go, another chapter, because i know you love to read it as much as i love to write it. i also love reading those lovely little reviews you guys send me, so don't be afraid to click that button and let me know your thoughts. you really don't know how much it makes my day! :D</B></P>
