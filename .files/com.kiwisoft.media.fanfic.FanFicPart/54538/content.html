<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Possibilities -->

<p>Sam woke to an absolutely pounding headache. She instantly
cursed consciousness as overrated and groaned, pulling her covers further over
her head. </p>
<p>"Wakey wakey sleepy head," Brooke's soft voice whispered from
a few feet away. Sam pulled the edge of her blanket down and she cracked open
one eye. Sitting beside the bed patiently was Brooke watching her with a glass
of OJ in one hand. Sam closed her eye when the light became too much.
</p>
<p>"Why am I so stupid?" she asked as she burrowed under her
covers again. She heard Brooke half-laugh, half-sigh. She heard the ruffle
signifying that Brooke had moved and then felt the bed shift as Brooke sat down
next to her. </p>
<p>"You're not stupid, you were upset. But next time, please find
a better way to deal with it," Brooke asked. "Alcohol isn't a solution, it's
another problem. Come on, I've got some asprin and juice for you. Sit up and
take it." Sam reluctantly did as she was told, the action making the room spin.
She hated hangovers. She stayed sitting up and leaned into Brooke. </p>
<p>"I really screwed up, huh?" she asked. Brooke rubbed her back. </p>
<p>"No, I did by driving you to that point, Sam. I never should
have kissed you and walked away," Brooke said guiltily. Sam sighed. (I knew she
didn't mean to kiss me) she thought dejectedly. </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, no harm, no foul. Won't mention it
again," Sam said as she leaned away from Brooke and back onto the bed. Brooke
looked at her in confusion. (How is she managing to twist everything I say?) </p>
<p>"Sam, that's not what I meant?" she started. Sam burrowed
further under the covers. </p>
<p>"Can we talk about this later, like when it doesn't feel like
a herd of elephants is galloping through my brain hunting for peanuts?" Brooke
giggled at the imagery. She layed down next to Sam. Sam shifted to face her. </p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she asked. Brooke kind of liked the
shocked look on Sam's face. </p>
<p>"Staying with you until you feel better, OK?" Sam frowned
slightly. </p>
<p>"You don't have to." Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"I want to," she assured the hungover brunette while brushing
some hair out of Sam's face. Sam smiled back. </p>
<p>"Oh, OK," Sam said as she closed her eyes. Brooke kissed the
end of Sam's nose and Sam tried to open her eyes but she was tired and they only
flickered open for a second giving Brooke a glance at the surprised brown orbs. </p>
<p>"Sleep, Sam, I'll be here when you wake up," Brooke whispered.
Sam let out a long sigh and fell asleep. Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam and
fell asleep a few minutes later. </p>

<p>Lily was walking through the park when Nicole found her. Lily
looked at the blonde suspiciously. </p>
<p>"Are you stalking me?" Lily asked. Nicole blushed. </p>
<p>"Uh, no," Nicole said although there was a slight lilt to her
voice that made it sound more like a question than an answer. Lily shook her
head, confused. </p>
<p>"I've talked to you more lately than I have our entire three
years of high school. What is up with you lately?" Lily asked. Nicole shrugged
as they started to walk again. </p>
<p>"I dunno, I like talking to you I guess," Lily looked at her
in shock. "What? I don't have to be Queen Bitch A Lot when I talk to you, it's a
nice change." </p>
<p>"Oh," (Well, that made a certain kind of Nicole sense) Lily
conceeded. "Aren't you afraid someone will see you talking to me?" Again Nicole
shrugged. </p>
<p>"Maybe it's time to upset my Mom's applecart," she said with a
wicked smile. "Besides, there's nothing I can do to dethrone Brooke, not that I
really want to and everyone, even Mary Cherry, is too afraid to go after me so,
I've got nothing to fear." </p>
<p>"Isn't it hard, having everyone either hate you or fear you, I
mean?" Lily asked. Nicole sighed. </p>
<p>"Lonely maybe. But I did it to myself so, what can you do?"
Lily smiled. </p>
<p>"Rock the boat?" Lily suggested. Nicole laughed. A genuine
laugh that Lily had never heard before and found that she liked. </p>
<p>"I'm not rocking it," Nicole said. "I'm poking holes in the
bottom of the sucker and watching it sink." Lily laughed. (God, this is SO not
Nicole, and yet it is) </p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan," Lily told her. Nicole nodded.
</p>
<p>"I'm working on it. So how's things on the Brooke and Sam
front?" Lily frowned. </p>
<p>"Brooke lost Sam last night," she said. At Nicole's confused
look, Lily elaborated and explained how Brooke had literally misplaced Sam and
couldn't find her, the kiss incident and by the time she was done explaining,
Nicole was wincing and shaking her head. </p>
<p>"Natural blondes, gotta love `em," Nicole muttered. "Did she
find her?" Lily shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno, but since I haven't heard from either of them I
guess she must have." </p>
<p>"Maybe they can talk it out and clean up the God awful mess in
front of them," Nicole hoped. "Just so that we don't have to." Lily nodded as
they sat down on a nearby bench. </p>
<p>"Weird though, isn't it? Brooke and Sam? Who'd have thought?"
Lily said with a half laugh. Nicole joined her for the laugh. </p>
<p>"Possibilities, Lily. They're endless," she said simply. </p>
<p>"I suppose," Lily sighed. "Would have been easier if Brooke
was straight though." </p>
<p>"And you could have had Sam when she got tired of waiting for
Brooke?" Nicole asked already knowing the answer. </p>
<p>"Yeah, and I would have waited however long it took, too,"
Lily responded while watching a bird pass over. She missed the hurt look on
Nicole's face. Lily turned to Nicole a serious expression on her face.
</p>
<p>"Really though, Nic, what's up with you lately? Not that I
mind but you've been preternaturally nice to me lately and excuse me because no
insult is intended but, I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop." Nicole
deflated a few more notches. </p>
<p>"No other shoe, Lily, honest," she said softly looking at her
feet. "Not even a Prada." </p>
<p>"Why me? You haven't been this way towards Carmen or Harrison,
I've noticed. Why me?" Nicole kept staring at her feet. </p>
<p>(Do I tell her or do I keep the boat steady? She likes Sam and
has made her distaste for me very plain. Argh, what to do, what to do) Nicole
mulled over her choices. Never really one for backing away from a challenge, she
found a middle ground. </p>
<p>"Have you ever heard the song `Superman (It's not easy)' by
Five for Fighting?" Nicole asked, throwing Lily off for a second. </p>
<p>"Probably, can't think of it off the top of my head right now,
why?" Lily asked getting confused. Nicole gave her a half-smile as she stood up. </p>
<p>"Tell you what, give the song a listen and really listen to it
and maybe you'll understand me a little better. It's a stretch but I find it
fits. And I'm gonna take a chance and steal a page from Brooke's book," she said
as she leaned over and brushed her lips over a very surprised Lily's. The kiss
was gentle, tentative. Nicole stood back up and looked into Lily's face.
</p>
<p>"Please forgive me," she whispered with tears in her eyes. She
turned and walked away leaving a shocked Lily on the park bench speechless. Lily
reached up and traced her fingers over her lips that were still tingling.
</p>
<p>(Uh, did Nicole Julian just kiss me?) she thought as her brain
kicked back in. (Yes, stupid, she did) her brain answered her. She bolted up off
the bench but Nicole was all ready gone. (OK, plan #2, where's the nearest
record store?) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam woke up again and her head felt better. She opened her
eyes and looked directly into Brooke's sleeping face. Sam hitched in a breath.
She always thought Brooke was beautiful but asleep the blonde was
heartbreakingly breathtaking. Angelic and innocent without a trace of stress or
worry on her face. Actually, right now Brooke looked rather content with her
arms wrapped around Sam and her face mere inches away. Sam traced the outline of
Brooke's lips with her eyes remembering how soft they were and how they tasted.
Tears stung her eyes as she recalled how convoluted things were. And how she
wasn't helping to make them any better. </p>
<p>"Don't cry, Sammy," Brooke whispered as her eyes focused on
Sam's. "Shhh?" she said as she pulled Sam closer. Sam sobbed into Brooke's
shoulder. </p>
<p>"I don't understand," Sam whispered as Brooke held her close. </p>
<p>"Are you ready to talk?" Brooke asked. Sam nodded against her.
Brooke took a deep breath and started at the beginning. </p>
<p>"I accidently overheard you and Lily talking that day in the
newspaper office. I know I should have walked away but I didn't and I'm sorry.
Well, no I'm not because otherwise I never would have known how you felt and
never would have been honest about how I felt." </p>
<p>"How do you feel?" Sam asked needing clarification. Brooke
thought for a second. </p>
<p>"I care very very deeply for you, I know that. But I don't
know if it's love, Sam," she said honestly. Sam tried not to look hurt but was
unsuccessful. Brooke brought her face back up to look her in the eyes. "But I
think it is, but it's different than what I felt with Josh," she explained. "So
I'm not sure." </p>
<p>"Oh," Sam said, understanding. "OK." Brooke smiled.
</p>
<p>"I know that I want you so bad it hurts," she said a blush
coming to her cheeks which Sam found endearing. "I dream about nothing else
which is a little frustrating in every sense of the word," she said with a
smile. Sam's eyes lit up. </p>
<p>"That night?" Sam asked refering to a few weeks ago. Brooke
nodded. </p>
<p>"I was dreaming about you," she admitted. Sam's mouth dropped
open and Brooke laughed. "Don't look so shocked, Sam." Sam blushed and arched an
eyebrow. </p>
<p>"So was I any good?" she asked cheekily. Brooke swatted her on
the shoulder. </p>
<p>"You heard the noises I was making, what do you think?" Brooke
said with a smirk. Sam blushed again. </p>
<p>"Oh geeze," she whispered strangely embarrassed. </p>
<p>"Anyway," Brooke interrupted, "back to the subject. I
overheard you and it got me to thinking about how I felt. Then I started to see
that I cared for you in a more than sisterly way." </p>
<p>"And we had that disasterous breakfast with Lily," Sam added
starting to follow the train of thought and put the pieces together. Brooke
nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, and she and I had it out over you in the bathroom. She
told me to grow up and reach out for what I wanted before it slipped away." </p>
<p>"That's why she was acting like a PMSing grizzly bear for so
long. She was waiting for you to make a move and it was driving her insane not
knowing what you were going to do," Sam sighed. (Poor Lily) </p>
<p>"That and probably knowing that I was going to go after you
and she'd lose you," Brooke added sadly. (Poor Lily) </p>
<p>"I'm still confused. How long have you been gay?" Sam asked.
"It's not just something you decide to do, like color your hair." </p>
<p>"I had a long chat with my subconscious," Brooke started </p>
<p>"The bitch? You mentioned that," Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"You remember that conversation?" Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"Steel trap, remember?" </p>
<p>"I still say cheese grate but anyway," Sam raspberried her,
"my subconscious says I've always had a thing for you so I guess I've always
been gay. I just suppressed it because I didn't understand it, I feared it and
then it didn't fit with the `popular' image I was saddled with." </p>
<p>"You've always had a `thing' for me?" Sam asked meekly in
surprise. </p>
<p>"I've apparently always `had my groove on for Sam McPherson
since before I knew what the groove was for'," Brooke explained as she ran her
fingers over the skin of Sam's neck just needing to touch her. Sam shivered
slightly in delight. </p>
<p>"This can't really be happening," Sam whispered. Brooke
frowned. </p>
<p>"Why do you insist on denying yourself what you want?" she
asked slightly annoyed. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"You don't get it," she said pulling away slightly. "I want
this, you so bad. But I'm afraid that it's all a dream that will slip away when
I reach out for it," she confessed, her voice cracking with emotion. "And I've
had that happen so many times that it nearly kills me each time. I'm afraid to
believe it, Brooke. Because it might all fade away." Brooke wiped away both
their tears and leaned in and captured Sam's lips in an impassioned and very
real kiss. </p>
<p>"Did that feel like a dream, Sam?" Sam shook her head in numb
shock. "I'm not going anywhere, Sam," Brooke promised. </p>
<p>"But what if you change your mind?" Brooke sighed at Sam's
question. "That'll kill me, Brooke, and if you're not sure I'd rather not start
this at all," Sam pleaded desperately for Brooke to understand. </p>
<p>"I don't know what else to say to you, Sam, except that I want
this. I want you and a chance with you and to see where it takes us. And I'm not
going to change my mind, that much I know." Sam mulled over the words for a few
minutes. </p>
<p>"Take the leap with me Sam, please?" Brooke asked after Sam
still had said nothing. Sam looked into Brooke's eyes and could only see the
honesty behind Brooke's words there. And love. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"OK, lead the way," she said as she snuggled closer. Brooke
welcomed her into her arms. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily slammed the door to her room and frantically searched for
her Walkman. After locating it she tried to open her new cd. (Who the Hell
invented CD wrap anyway?) she questioned as it stubbornly refused to open. (Oh,
I hope there's a special place in Hell for the person who invented CD wrap)
Finally succeeding in unwrapping the cd, Lily placed it in the Walkman and put
track three on. She listened intently to the words as she repeatedly listened to
the song. </p>

<p>OK, so Nicole was no hero by anyone's definition or stretch of
the imagination but somehow, Lily could see her point. Like Superman, Nicole was
forced to play a part and sometimes just wanted out of it, for someone to see
the person behind the persona. It couldn't be easy to be Nicole, with everyone
either hating or fearing her. Hell, even a part of Lily was still suspicious of
her even though Nic hadn't done anything but be nice lately. But because being
nice was so out of character, Lily was automatically on guard. She chastized
herself for that. </p>
<p>(So, what was up with that kiss?) she wondered as the song
cycled through again. (Could Nic have feelings for me?) she laughed outloud at
that thought. (Is anyone in town straight anymore? Of course, I've all ready
lost Sam and could do a lot worse than Nicole Julian) Again she laughed outloud.
(Did I just really think that? Worse than Satan herself? But lately Nic's been
nothing like that bitch persona she fronts at school and I actually like her. I
don't know if I LIKE like her but I did enjoy that kiss) she admitted.
</p>
<p>She listened to the lyrics again. Turning them to fit Nicole
like Nic had asked made Nic seem so vulnerable, human. Lily shook her head. (I
am getting SO confused) She stood up off her bed and headed to the door, Walkman
still firmly attached. (And if I want to stop being confused, I think I'd better
go talk to Nicole) </p>
