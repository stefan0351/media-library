<!-- Valentine Rules of Engagement \ Story -->

<P><i>Old Earth calendar 13th February</i>
<P>As soon as the doors to their quarters opened to reveal the preoccupied form
of his wife, Tom Paris started in on his rehearsed speech of disapproval.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh so you finally decided to come home then. I thought maybe you'd given up
all pretence of an outside life and just moved in to engineering.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What are you talking about Tom?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh well that's progress, at least you seem to remember my name.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;I'm not really in the mood for this.&quot; Ignoring her husband B'Elanna went
straight to their bedroom to check on Anna, the three month old baby was
sleeping soundly, oblivious to her parents brewing row.</P>
<P>&quot;You're not in the mood?&quot; Tom's voice rose in both volume and pitch. &quot;Well
that's not exactly new is it? You're never in the mood for anything, except work
or playing with the baby.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Keep your voice down!&quot; B'Elanna urged, emerging from the bedroom she closed
the door to allow her daughter some peace while Tom had another of his customary
rants. If only she could curl up in the cot next to her little girl and not have
to listen to his constant complaints, then she'd be happy.</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, so where have you been?&quot; Tom demanded, the lowered tone not hiding his
anger.</P>
<P>&quot;You know where I've been, Seven and I were modifying the sensor array.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You and Seven? I should have known you'd be with the Borg.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't call her that.&quot; B'Elanna was starting to get angry now, she'd been
surviving on four hours sleep a night for the past three months, and the last
thing she needed was Mr 'high and mighty' Paris questioning her movements or
insulting her friends.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm so sorry, I forgot she's your new best friend.&quot; His sarcastic comment
was accompanied by a sneer, the way Seven and B'Elanna appeared to have bonded
over the last six months was an almost reverse copy of his own disintegrating
relationship with his wife, and so to be scorned.</P>
<P>&quot;Just what is your problem flyboy?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;You. You're my problem.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh what now?&quot; B'Elanna pushed by him to the couch. &quot;Did I forget to curtsey
low enough when you entered? Or maybe I failed to have your dinner replicated
for when you got in from your hard day of sitting about watching while the ship
ran on autopilot?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lanna come on, lets not fight okay?&quot; Knowing that when B'Elanna started
attacking his piloting skills that he'd gone too far, Tom decided to try a
different approach. &quot;I'm just on edge because I miss you, we never seem to spend
anytime together.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And that's my fault?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;No, of course not.&quot; Sitting by B'Elanna on the couch Tom tried putting his
arm around her, but the irritated woman simply moved to the farthest end of the
seat out of his way. &quot;Come on Lanna, even you have to admit you spend a lot of
time down in engineering.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm the Chief Engineer, so of course I spend a lot of time down there.&quot; She
gave him a look that questioned not only his intelligence but also his sanity.
&quot;Besides I've halved my hours since the baby came, which is more than I can say
for you. You act like some primitive ape man who expects me to look after the
baby just because I'm a woman.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's not fair, I look after her while you're on duty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh wow yeah, I forgot those gruelling four hours a day you put in while
she's asleep.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've offered to get us a baby-sitter so we can go out one night.&quot; Tom's tone
took on a hurt quality, his usefulness as a father having been questioned.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm too tired to go out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You weren't too tired to spend all day with Seven playing around with the
sensors.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We were working!&quot; Getting up B'Elanna turned her back on Tom with the
pretext of replicating a drink, the real reason was that she could no-longer
bring herself to look at the man.</P>
<P>&quot;Well what about last night then?&quot; Tom followed B'Elanna to the replicator
blocking her exit. &quot;The two of you sat in here for hours playing with the kid
and going over reports. You weren't too tired for that were you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Her name is Anna, not the kid, and in case you've forgotten she happens to
by our child, and so yes I like to spend time with her.&quot; B'Elanna looked at him
with disgust. &quot;Maybe you should try it sometime.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well maybe if Seven wasn't here all the time I would.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Aren't you forgetting something?&quot; B'Elanna questioned.</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You were the one who asked me to come home early and look after Anna so you
could go play in the holodeck with Harry.&quot; A strong Klingon finger bashed into
his chest with increasing force. &quot;Seven was simply kind enough to change the
venue of our meeting to here so that YOU could go have fun.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what about all the other times? That Borg is always round here.&quot; Trying
to be inconspicuous Tom massaged the now very sore, and no doubt bruising, spot
on his chest. &quot;Even when she's not here you're out someplace together, taking
the kid, I mean Anna, to the holodeck or the hydroponics bay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Seven happens to be my friend, and I like spending time with her.&quot; B'Elanna
thought about mentioning she'd rather spend time with the ex-drone than Tom any
day, but decided for the sake of her dwindling energy reserves to try and put a
stop to the argument and get some sleep. &quot;If I could I'd spend more time with
you, but with the baby and our schedules it's difficult.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But don't you see, that's why we have to make more of an effort to be with
one another.&quot; Tom granted his wife a condescending smile, having presumed he'd
won the argument. &quot;Tomorrow's Valentines Day, how about I get us a baby-sitter
and we go to the party the Captain's hosting? It'll give us time to ourselves as
a couple.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Fine.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That's great.&quot; Leaning forward Tom placed a chaste kiss on B'Elanna's lips.
&quot;I'll see if they can keep the baby until the morning, give us time to really be
ourselves.&quot; His wink was met with a look of boredom.</P>
<P>&quot;Fine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, that's settled.&quot; Moving towards the doors Tom heard the distinctive
sounds of Anna waking up. &quot;I think the baby needs you, I'm meeting Harry for a
few hours in Sandrines, see you later.&quot; With that he was gone.</P>
<P>&quot;Arse hole!&quot;</P>

<p><br><i>Old Earth calendar 14th February</i></P>
<P>Icheb absentmindedly drummed his fingers against the astrometrics console,
his uncharacteristic behaviour earning him a raised ocular implant from his
mentor and friend.</P>
<P>&quot;Is there something bothering you?&quot; Seven enquired, having learnt that
particular gesture was often a sign of nervousness.</P>
<P>&quot;No.&quot; He looked down at his still tapping fingers and ceased their activity.
&quot;I was unaware of my actions, I shall desist in future.&quot; Seven just nodded and
continued with her work. The young boy also attempted to continue with his work
but the excitement he was no-longer able to express through his drumming fingers
found an outlet in some very un-Borglike rambling. &quot;Non-conscious muscular
movement is an interesting phenomenon, messages transported through the nervous
system to..&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you sure there is nothing wrong?&quot; Seven interrupted, it was so unusual
for the boy to say more than three consecutive words.</P>
<P>&quot;I believe I am experiencing excitement due to the upcoming Valentines
party.&quot; Icheb admitted.</P>
<P>&quot;I see.&quot; Uninterested Seven turned back to her work.</P>
<P>&quot;Will you be attending?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I had not planned on doing so, although the Captain has suggested that it
would be beneficial if I were to attend.&quot; A slight frown crossed her face,
&quot;However I fail to see the benefit of the occasion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is a celebration of romance.&quot; Icheb supplied, he had been given a quick
description of the event from Naomi Wildman, who had been unusually moody due to
being denied access to the party by her mother. &quot;The Captain probably assumes it
would be to your advantage to interact on a more informal basis with possible
future romantic partners.&quot;</P>
<P>The ocular implant jumped alarmingly high on Seven's brow. &quot;She expects me to
find a partner at this event?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not necessarily today.&quot; Icheb reassured. </P>
<P>&quot;Indeed.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;All of the senior staff and most of the Alpha and Beta shifts will be in
attendance, you would be conspicuous by your absence.&quot; In truth the boy was too
nervous to go by himself and the only person he felt really comfortable with was
Seven.</P>
<P>&quot;All of the senior staff?&quot; Seven double checked.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Ensign More agreed to baby-sit for Naomi Wildman and Anna Torres-Paris
so both of their parents could attend. Mr Kim has also relinquished the command
of the Gamma shift in order to attend the event.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I see.&quot; Waiting a moment Seven appeared to rethink her earlier decision, in
truth the moment she'd heard that B'Elanna would be in attendance she'd decided
to go. &quot;In that case you may be correct, my absence would be conspicuous,
therefore I believe it would be prudent for me to attend.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;If you are agreeable I will accompany you, as I believe we are meant to
arrive in pairs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Acceptable.&quot; Seven turned back to her console for a moment. &quot;Why are we
expected in twos?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am unsure.&quot; He stood motionless while accessing his Borg acquired memory,
but it would seem the Collective didn't judge knowledge about Valentines Day
worthy of assimilation. &quot;I could search the Federation database for information
on the celebration.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We do not have the time.&quot; The blonde wasn't really interested in even more
human customs, besides they were still on duty. &quot;Besides I'm sure the Captain
will inform us of any special regulations.&quot;</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Having dutifully arrived at the Valentines party with her husband, B'Elanna
wasted no time in ditching Tom and finding someone a bit more interesting to
talk to, in this case Chakotay and Mr Neelix. This left Tom free to chat with
Harry and start a running commentary on all the good looking women at the
gathering.</P>
<P>&quot;Look at that dress Nicoletti's wearing, you can tell she bought it with the
single minded intention of some lucky soul taking it off of her tonight.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What makes you think that Tom?&quot; Harry quickly looked around to make sure
no-one could overhear his friend.</P>
<P>&quot;It's obvious.&quot; Tom unconsciously licked his lips as he imagined the dresses
removal. &quot;I mean just look at the thing, it's only held up by that clasp at the
shoulder, one tiny movement and the whole things a discarded mound on the
floor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I guess.&quot; Harry just thought the dress looked nice, and the colour suited
Susan.</P>
<P>&quot;I'll bet you a months replicator rations she's wearing sexy black lingerie
underneath.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;No bet.&quot; The younger man was getting more and more embarrassed by his
friends comments. </P>
<P>&quot;Come on Harry don't be a spoil sport.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I said no, besides there's no way we'd be able to find out even if she
was.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sure there is.&quot; A lecherous gleam entered Tom's eyes as he began planning a
series of manoeuvres to part Susan Nicoletti from her clothing. His thoughts
were interrupted by an elbow to the ribs, &quot;Hey!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Captain.&quot; Harry whispered before looking up to smile at the approaching
woman. &quot;Lovely party Captain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm glad you're enjoying it Harry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, great party.&quot; Tom agreed.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled at the helmsman before inclining her head to indicate B'Elanna
on the other side of the room. &quot;It's good to see you persuaded B'Elanna to
attend, I know she's been rather snowed under, what with a new baby and work to
worry about.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well you know B'Elanna, trying to get her to slow down isn't easy.&quot; Tom
smiled over at his wife, she in turn pretended she hadn't seen him smirking at
her. &quot;I do as much as I can to help with the baby, but even so she's never
satisfied until she's double checked everything herself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She probably thinks you'll put the babies nappy on the wrong end.&quot; Harry
added, earning a laugh from Janeway and a frown from Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;She knows full well how responsible I am with my child.&quot; Tom said
stiffly.</P>
<P>Harry was about to say that was why she would worry, when the Captain
interrupted them both to call over a newly arrived Icheb and Seven.</P>
<P>&quot;It's good to see you could both make it.&quot; Kathryn bestowed a warm smile on
the two former Borg, although her attention was firmly fixed on the female of
the pair. They both merely nodded in agreement while surveying the large
room.</P>
<P>&quot;So Seven, did you get any Valentines cards?&quot; Harry asked hopefully, having
left one for her himself earlier that day.</P>
<P>&quot;What are they?&quot; The blonde inquired. &quot;Was I suppose to bring them this
evening?&quot;</P>
<P>Tom laughed at Seven's lack of knowledge while both the Captain and Harry
just smiled indulgently. &quot;No they're not something you bring, they're something
you're given.&quot; Harry tried to explain, but from the frowns forming on both the
ex-Borg's brows he knew his attempt was failing. &quot;It's a piece of card with a
greeting written inside, and Valentines ones usually have cute pictures on the
front, like hearts and flowers or something.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is the purpose of the card?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well it's a way of declaring your love to someone.&quot; Harry blushed. &quot;On
Valentines you get to tell the person you love how you feel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is it mandatory that you declare your love?&quot; Seven tried to clarify, it
seemed a strange ritual but then no stranger than some of the others she had
witnessed.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah Seven, it's a Valentine rule.&quot; Tom smirked.</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Seven looked rather pensive at this news.</P>
<P>&quot;So is there someone you should be declaring yourself to?&quot; Tom pushed, he
smelled a juicy bit of gossip and wasn't above tricking the young woman to get
it.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot; Kathryn and Harry just stood there, both knew they should intervene
and explain to Seven that the declaration wasn't infact compulsory, but each
secretly hoped the young Borg would proclaim her love for them. &quot;Although I had
not thought it appropriate to mention who.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?&quot; Tom dug further.</P>
<P>&quot;Because she is already married to you.&quot; Seven answered truthfully.</P>
<P>Tom just looked at her in open mouthed shock, unable to process the notion of
the blonde in love with his wife. Kathryn and Harry shared a look of unrequited
love before their faces took on an 'uh oh!' expression as they realised the
possible implications of what they had conspired to get Seven to admit.</P>
<P>&quot;You mean you're in love with B'Elanna?&quot; Tom had to hear the words spoken
before he could truly believe them.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes I am.&quot;</P>
<P>Face turning a dark crimson Tom turned from the group and stormed over to
where B'Elanna was laughing with Chakotay and Neelix. Seven followed his
progress with a look of utter confusion, while Janeway and Harry began inching
forward ready to mount damage control.</P>
<P>&quot;You bitch!&quot; Tom screamed at his wife, grabbing her arm he forced her to turn
and face him. &quot;I knew something was wrong, you haven't let me come near you in
months, but I never thought even you would go so low as to fuck the Borg.&quot; All
eyes in the room focused on the couple as B'Elanna wrenched her arm from Tom's
bruising grip.</P>
<P>&quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; Anger and confusion laced B'Elanna's
voice, &quot;Are you drunk or something?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't try and act all innocent, the Borg's already admitted it.&quot; Tom
seethed.</P>
<P>&quot;Admitted what?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That she's in love with you.&quot; Tom made another grab for B'Elanna's arm. &quot;So
come on then how long have you been fucking her? Was it before our wedding night
or after?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have no idea what you're talking about.&quot; Through the confusion and anger
B'Elanna experienced a moment of joy when Tom mentioned Seven saying she was in
love with her, but it didn't last long, it was probably just another drunken
fantasy on her husbands behalf, just like the idea of them having an affair.</P>
<P>Harry came over to try and calm his friend down, but just received a shove to
the ground for his troubles. &quot;God! I was so dense, you were practically doing
her in front of me and I never even noticed. Did it make you feel good? Parading
your little mechanical play toy infront of me, did you both have a good laugh at
my expense?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know what you thinks been going on but whatever it is you're
wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't lie to me.&quot; Tom's screams reached to the far end of the room, spittle
flying from his mouth as he gestured forcefully towards a dumbstruck Seven. &quot;You
and that bitch have made a fool of me for the last time. I want out of this sham
of a marriage, lets see if the ice queen over there can satisfy you.&quot; With that
he turned and stormed out of the now silent room.</P>
<P>All eyes in the room focused on B'Elanna, the young woman was just standing
there in shock, she couldn't understand what had just happened, one moment she'd
been happily listening to Neelix describe a scouting mission to some far off
Delta Quadrant pleasure spot, the next Tom was ending their marriage. Finally
looking up she locked glances with Seven, her supposed lover, who was looking
just as baffled as she was, albeit in a Borg way.</P>
<P>Seven made her way to the half Klingon. &quot;I am sorry B'Elanna.&quot; Looking over
her shoulder she followed the now deserted path left by Tom Paris. &quot;I do not
know what happened, I never said we were involved.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's not your fault.&quot; B'Elanna didn't really know who's fault it was, or if
it was anybody's, but she knew Seven wouldn't spread untruths about them. &quot;I
erm, excuse me Seven, Captain.&quot; Needing some time on her own B'Elanna left the
room.</P>
<P>&quot;Okay the shows over, lets all get back to the party.&quot; Janeaway instructed
the gawking audience. </P>
<P>Seven waited a few minutes then left for her alcove.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br><i>Old Earth calendar 15th February</i></P>
<P>For the third time that morning B'Elanna read through the data pad Harry had
regretfully dropped off for her only an hour ago. It was a brief document
stating a petition by Thomas Eugene Paris for the dissolution of his marriage to
B'Elanna Torres, and equal visitation rites to his daughter Anna P'nar
Torres-Paris. The reason for the divorce had been given as irreconcilable
differences, unknown to B'Elanna it had taken half a night of persuasion from
Harry to change Tom's original reason, which had been adultery. What Harry
didn't realise is that if he'd allowed Tom to site adultery then B'Elanna would
have refused the divorce, as she had never been unfaithful. As it was the term
irreconcilable differences seemed to sum up the last five or six months of their
marriage perfectly. So with a heavy heart and tears cascading down her cheeks
B'Elanna pressed the button on the pad that would agree to the terms and so end
her marriage.</P>
<P>Picking up her baby B'Elanna hugged the little girl, crying softly into her
hair and taking comfort from the feel of the baby soft skin. &quot;I'm so sorry
Annie, I'm so sorry.&quot; The loss of her husband was something B'Elanna had taken
with ease, she'd know the marriage was over for a long while, but the loss of
Anna's father was a blow, even though she knew he would still be around, and
would visit the child, it just wasn't the same. So for that she cried.</P>
<P>&lt;Chime&gt;</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked towards the door, she didn't really want to talk with anyone
but knew that if she refused whoever it was entry she would only end up with a
string of concerned friends on her door.</P>
<P>&quot;Come in.&quot;</P>
<P>Cautiously Seven of Nine entered the room, her eyes immediately picking up
the traces of recently shed tears. &quot;Are you damaged?&quot; In two long strides she
was by the mother and child examining them both. &quot;Is Anna unwell?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No she's fine, we're both fine.&quot; Freeing an arm B'Elanna tried to wipe the
tears from her cheek, her erratic swipes were soon pushed aside as Seven gently
stroked her face with a surprisingly warm hand, clearing all signs of tears.</P>
<P>&quot;If you are both well why were you crying?&quot; Seven's voice was soft, the sight
of B'Elanna in tears had disturbed and pained her.</P>
<P>&quot;Here.&quot; B'Elanna handed her the data pad.</P>
<P>After reading the contents Seven's look of concern doubled in intensity. &quot;I
am sorry Lieutenant, I was wrong, it is my fault.&quot; Starting to pace she turned
to regard mother and child. &quot;I could speak with Mr Paris, properly explain my
comments from yesterday.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no need Seven.&quot; Looking down at Anna B'Elanna admitted the truth.
&quot;It's for the best this way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot; That decided it was like a weight had been lifted from B'Elanna's
shoulders, but with it she began to again wonder what had transpired yesterday
to make Tom act in this way. &quot;Seven, what exactly did you say to Tom?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I said that I thought it inappropriate for me to mention with whom I was in
love as you were already married to him.&quot; Seven replayed the conversation in her
mind to best describe the events to the other woman. &quot;Then he asked me to
confirm that I was in love with you and so I did.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You... Why?&quot; The blood seemed to have vacated B'Elanna's brain, making
coherent thought very difficult.</P>
<P>&quot;Because it is a Valentine rule.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Huh?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lieutenant Paris stated that on Valentines Day you are expected to divulge
who you are in love with.&quot; Seven was beginning to realise that the rules were
perhaps a figment of Tom's imagination. &quot;I would not have said anything but I
thought it was mandatory.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you said me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh.&quot; B'Elanna blushed an interesting shade of red. &quot;Is that true?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh.&quot; B'Elanna just looked at the young blonde in confusion, too much had
happened already today for her to take it all in.</P>
<P>Feeling awkward Seven stepped back from the others. &quot;If you will excuse me
Lieutenant I am scheduled to begin my duty shift.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, sure Seven.&quot;</P>
<P>With that the lanky ex-Borg made her escape from the now totally overwhelmed
engineer.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br><i>Old Earth calendar 16th February</i></P>
<P>Neelix spotted B'Elanna with the baby patiently waiting in line by the
kitchen counter for her evening meal. The young mother and child seemed
oblivious to those around them, which was fortunate as most of the people
surrounding the two couldn't keep their eyes off them. News of the events at the
Valentine party had spread rapidly throughout the crew, and most if not all were
anxious for any sign of further gossip. </P>
<P>&quot;Good evening B'Elanna,&quot; he greeted warmly, &quot;and how's my little Anniekins
doing today?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She's being a good little girl today, aren't you Annie?&quot; B'Elanna cooed at
her daughter. &quot;She managed to sleep for nearly six hours straight last night.&quot;
She confided in Neelix. &quot;I think it's the first six full hours of sleep I've
gotten since time began.&quot;</P>
<P>The Talaxian laughed at B'Elanna's weary but proud sigh. &quot;I remember when my
sister was a baby, she kept the whole house up for a month with her night time
crying, in the end mother and father took it in turns to take us to a friends to
sleep over.&quot; His own smile of remembrance was slightly marred by the knowledge
he would never again see his sister, as she'd died some time ago. &quot;I still think
of her every time I hear a baby cry.&quot;</P>
<P>Seeing the sad look enter his eyes B'Elanna held out the baby for him to
hold, not something she allowed many people to do. &quot;Can you hold her for me a
minute, I think my arms going to sleep.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes of course.&quot; A smile the size of a dinner plate consumed Neelix's
face as he looked down at the tiny bundle. &quot;Why don't you sit down and I'll
fetch you something to eat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you.&quot; B'Elanna made to retake the baby. &quot;Do you want me to take
her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no I'm fine.&quot; Neelix skipped towards the kitchen talking nonsense to the
baby until he noticed B'Elanna hadn't moved. &quot;You go and sit, we'll be with you
in a minute.&quot;</P>
<P>Her eyes still following the pair B'Elanna sat at the closest table.</P>
<P>&quot;Here you go, Malarni casserole and boiled potato, one of your favourites.&quot;
Neelix deposited the plate and took his place across the table, keeping hold of
the baby.</P>
<P>&quot;Mmm it looks nice.&quot; B'Elanna took a welcome bite of the tasty dish, but her
eyes constantly returned to her sleeping daughter. &quot;Are you okay, or would you
like me to hold her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm fine, you eat.&quot; Neelix urged. &quot;Oh, unless you'd rather take charge of
her?&quot;</P>
<P>B'Elanna noticed his disappointed tone and realised she was being over
protective. &quot;No that's okay you hold her.&quot; With a smile she once again began
demolishing her food.</P>
<P>&quot;I can imagine it's hard to pass them over to someone else when they're so
little.&quot; The Talaxian began blowing raspberries at the little girl, much to her
delight.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, I didn't think I'd be so protective, I mean I've known and worked with
most of the people on this ship for nearly seven years, but there are only a few
I'd trust to hold my baby.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Well she is a lot more precious than a warp core.&quot; Neelix added
understandingly.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, and I'm sure when she gets a bit older I won't worry so much, but for
now her list of pickers up is restricted to me, you, Seven, Sam Wildman, Harry,
Tuvok, oh and Tom.&quot; B'Elanna thought for a second. &quot;Maybe Eliza More, I mean she
did baby-sit that once, but I was a wreck when it came to leaving Annie there,
fortunately Naomi was there too so it seemed all right. So I guess it should
really be Naomi's name I add, after all she's picked her up a few times when we
were both visiting Seven, and after the first time I didn't worry at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She's a responsible girl.&quot; Neelix concurred. &quot;I noticed neither the Captain
or Commander Chakotay made it onto your list.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, you noticed that.&quot; B'Elanna seemed a little embarrassed. &quot;It's not that
I don't trust them, I mean when she's a few months older I'd gladly let them
look after her for a while, but well, neither of them has much experience of
kids.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, I understand.&quot; Neelix debated whether to ask his next question but he
was concerned about his friend and wanted to make sure she was really okay. &quot;How
are things going with you and Tom? You don't have to say anything if you'd
rather not.&quot;</P>
<P>B'Elanna considered his question and whether or not she wanted to answer it,
of all the people on the ship Neelix was one of the few she'd trust with her
daughter, and she realised also one of the few she'd trust with her secrets.
&quot;You heard about the divorce?&quot; Neelix nodded. &quot;Well I can't say I like the
circumstances under which it happened, but I'm glad it's finally over. I just
hope the crew doesn't believe all that stuff Tom was raving about, not so much
for my sake, but Seven has enough prejudice to deal with just being a former
Borg, she doesn't need the crew believing she broke up a marriage too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Unfortunately there are some people on board who are more than ready to
blame either a former Borg or member of the Maquis for practically anything. For
them it would just be a case of the outsiders interfering in a Starfleet
officers marriage.&quot; His uncharacteristic pessimism displayed just how much this
troubled the normally cheerful Talaxian. It wasn't only the thought of other
peoples narrow minded views that bothered him, but the idea that it might form a
barrier between B'Elanna and Seven. &quot;Have you spoken to Seven since the
party?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, she came to see me the next day.&quot; Having finished her meal B'Elanna
reached over for Anna, somehow finding comfort in holding her child. &quot;I'd not
long received the divorce document and wasn't exactly at my best.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What happened?&quot; Neelix feared they had an argument.</P>
<P>&quot;She offered to talk with Tom, but I told her not to bother.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know Seven is extremely fond of you and the baby, it would be a shame if
this put a barrier between you.&quot;</P>
<P>Looking round B'Elanna leaned across the table to whisper to Neelix. &quot;She
said she was in love with me.&quot;</P>
<P>Neelix wasn't surprised the signs had been there for anyone to see. &quot;How do
you feel about her?&quot; Again he believed he knew the answer but it would require
B'Elanna admitting the truth to herself first.</P>
<P>Sitting back in her chair B'Elanna thought seriously about the question for a
moment before reaching a decision. Leaning back across the table she was about
to give her answer when..</P>
<P>&quot;Hi Lanna.&quot; Tom said rather loudly, making the two conspirators jump.</P>
<P>&quot;For Christ's sake Tom don't sneak up on people like that.&quot; B'Elanna
snapped.</P>
<P>&quot;Sorry.&quot; Giving Neelix a meaningful look he continued. &quot;Look can we talk, in
private?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought you like talking in public.&quot; She accused. &quot;If you have something
to say then say it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right.&quot; Tom held up his arms in a sign of surrender before taking the
seat Neelix had just decided to vacate. &quot;I spoke with Seven this morning, she
convinced me that nothing had been going on between you and that all the
feelings were strictly on her side only. I was wrong Lanna and I wanted to
apologise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You.. &quot; B'Elanna cut off the name she was going to call him in deference to
the child now sleeping in her arms. &quot;You dishonoured both me and Seven infront
of nearly the entire crew with your wild accusations.&quot; The raised voice was
beginning to attract the attention of other diners, not to mention disturbing
the child.</P>
<P>&quot;I know and I'm truly sorry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's not good enough!&quot; B'Elanna's temper was getting out of hand so she
took a calming breath to regain her focus. &quot;I want an apology infront of
everyone, the Captain, the rest of the senior staff, and not just for me, I want
you to apologise to Seven too, she did nothing wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She admitted being in love with you.&quot; He protested.</P>
<P>&quot;So? That's not a crime, she never would have said anything if you hadn't
tricked her into it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, I'll apologise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot; Tom looked round him at the nearly full mess-hall. &quot;I can't do it
here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll give you ten minutes to arrange for the senior staff to be here.&quot; With
that B'Elanna turned her back on her ex-husband.</P>
<P>Eight and a half minutes later a baffled senior staff and intrigued
population of the mess-hall all quietened down to listen to Lieutenant Tom
Paris.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm here now to make an official apology.&quot; He smiled down at a
non-responsive B'Elanna. &quot;Two nights ago at the Valentines party I made some
rash, and I now know incorrect accusations against my then wife B'Elanna Torres
and Seven of Nine. I wish to apologise to both of these women for my behaviour
and comments on that occasion, and I want to state for the record that I do not
believe either of them would carry out the sort of underhanded act of which I
condemned them.&quot; Tom again looked towards B'Elanna to gauge if he'd said enough,
and this time he received a tiny nod in acknowledgement. &quot;So basically that's
it, I'm sorry B'Elanna and you too Seven, and I hope you can both forgive me.&quot;
At the last part he couldn't resist giving the room one of his most boyish
smiles.</P>
<P>&quot;Fine.&quot; B'Elanna muttered as she prepared to leave.</P>
<P>&quot;Before everyone goes there is one more thing I'd like to add.&quot; Tom's raised
voice managed to recapture his audience. &quot;I made a terrible mistake two nights
ago, but it pales into insignificance next to the mistake I made the following
morning. That mistake was to ask my lovely wife for a divorce, it is a mistake I
would very much like to correct.&quot; Here Tom turned to focus on B'Elanna. &quot;I was a
fool Lanna, please take me back.&quot;</P>
<P>There were sighs from a few women in the audience but B'Elanna was oblivious
to them as her eyes sought out the ocean blue of Seven of Nine's. The tall
blonde looked to be in a state of shock, her hands trembling in agitation as she
waited for the reply to the last part of Tom's speech. &quot;I'm sorry Tom but I
don't think so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What? Why?&quot; He blurted having been so sure she would welcome him back.</P>
<P>Looking straight into Seven's eyes B'Elanna smiled warmly, &quot;Because I'm in
love with Seven.&quot;</P>
<P>Passing a shocked and stuttering Tom B'Elanna stopped infront of Seven and
held out her hand not occupied in holding the baby. &quot;Can we go somewhere and
talk?&quot;</P>
<P>Nodding Seven's placed her hand in B'Elanna's and followed her out of the
room.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Having entered her quarters B'Elanna went straight to the cot in the bedroom
and lay Anna down to sleep. Seven followed her and watched enchanted as the tiny
child curled up in slumber. &quot;She is beautiful.&quot; Seven commented, her eyes
feasting on the light brown hair and slight forehead ridges so like her mothers.
&quot;She looks like you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you.&quot; Still looking down at her daughter B'Elanna asked. &quot;Do you know
why I called her Anna?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen so I decided to name her
after the most beautiful and precious person I knew.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And her name is Anna?&quot; Seven asked, wondering exactly what this woman's
relationship was to B'Elanna.</P>
<P>&quot;Well actually her names Seven, but when she was a child it was Annika, I
just kind of shortened it so no-one would know.&quot; B'Elanna turned away at the
last part in an attempt to hide her blush.</P>
<P>&quot;You named her after me?&quot; The joy in Seven's voice pulled B'Elanna around to
look into the radiantly smiling face. With her nod of affirmation a lone tear
made its way down Seven's cheek. &quot;Thank you B'Elanna, I.. Thank you.&quot;</P>
<P>Feeling her hearts constrict with the sight B'Elanna moved forward to engulf
the taller woman in an embrace. The hug was warm and friendly a sign of family
not desire. After a few minutes they released their hold and with a shyness
neither had experienced in years they made their way out into the living
area.</P>
<P>&quot;Would you like a drink?&quot; B'Elanna suddenly thought to ask as the silence
became uncomfortable.</P>
<P>&quot;I do not require, I mean I am not thirsty at the moment.&quot; Seven corrected
herself. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She added on the end as her lessons on politeness
resurfaced.</P>
<P>They sat next to one another on the couch, their hands firmly placed on their
knees, and at least six inches of space between them. They sat like that for
almost five minutes without a sound, &quot;Kahless! This is ridiculous.&quot; B'Elanna
stormed and turned on the couch to face Seven, the action having the added
pleasure of placing her leg into contact with Seven's hip. &quot;We're sitting here
like two teenagers on their first blind date.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am unsure of how to behave.&quot; Seven admitted. &quot;I have never been in this
position before.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well me either really.&quot; Reaching over B'Elanna captured Seven's hands
between her own. &quot;What I said in the mess-hall, I just want you to know that I
meant it. I love you Seven.&quot;</P>
<P>A smile captured Seven's face. &quot;I love you too.&quot;</P>
<P>For a few moments the two just sat there staring at each other, both
overwhelmed by what they had finally been able to declare and receive, love.</P>
<P>&quot;B'Elanna.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can I kiss you?&quot; Seven's voice was tentative, not through fear of rejection
but the excitement of being given permission to finally feel B'Elanna's lips
against her own.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>Leaning towards one another their lips met, gently at first but with growing
passion as arms took their place holding onto each other, fingers caressing the
others skin. Words of love were exchanged as two friends became lovers, and
their household became a family.</P>
