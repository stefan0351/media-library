<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 10 - Accidents Do Happen-->

<P>As the two walked the 2 km distance to the apple patch B'Elanna couldn't help
but steal glances at Seven. The Borg had her hair down and B'Elanna wondered how
that had happened. Most of last night was but a hazy dream to B'Elanna. She had
dreamt that she met her long lost love, but Seven seemed to know a little to
much about her past. B'Elanna figured that she had talked in her sleep and Seven
had overheard. But who has paranoid delusions in their sleep B'Elanna wondered.
In order for someone to have a paranoid delusion, wouldn't they have to be
awake, she thought to herself. "Oh God no!" B'Elanna stopped in her tracks.</P>
<P>Seven as usual was walking ahead efficiently but heard B'Elanna stop, not to
mention the little curse. Seven stopped, turned around and asked "Is there a
problem Lt. Torres?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna had her right hand on her head lightly rubbing her ridges. "What
Seven?" Looking up she saw the Borg standing there hair blowing through the
wind, with a look of concern. "I asked if there was a problem." Seven spoke with
a softness that was slightly familiar to B'Elanna, but she couldn't remember
when she had heard it. Heart pounding, blood racing, B'Elanna was faced with the
possibility that the dream she had last night was not in fact a dream. In fact
it was more than just a possibility she thought as images raced through her mind
in an unending blur. The images grew clearer and came more slowly. But she began
to develop a headache and pressed her right hand to her head tightly and fell to
one knee. As B'Elanna was able to sort the images out a hand suddenly touched
her shoulder. "Are you okay?" The soft heavenly voice reverberated through her
ears as she tried to recognize the person in front of her. </P>
<P>"Claire?" B'Elanna managed to get out through the now piercing headache.
"Ahh!" The headache continued to grow in intensity. And B'Elanna now had both
hands pressing against her head. "Lt. Torres, I am Seven of Nine, what kind of
pain are you experiencing?" Seven had both hands on either shoulder hoping to
get B'Elanna to recognize her. B'Elanna's head tilted upward, the image of
Claire and Seven blended together and switched slowly back and forth. The
headache that so suddenly caused her pain, had slowly began to dissipate as
B'Elanna started to recognize Seven again. "Seven?" B'Elanna said unsure of who
she was looking at. "The Borg cracked a slight smile relieved that B'Elanna had
regained her senses. "Yes, that is correct Lt. Torres, now may you please tell
me what is wrong with you so I may treat you." Seven was genuinely concerned.
</P>
<P>"Oh, just a piercing headache Seven, although it's not piercing anymore
thankfully." B'Elanna said rubbing her eyes." When she opened them again she was
staring right into Seven's beautiful blue eyes. "I am uncertain as to how to
treat a headache Lieutenant. However if you have a dislocated shoulder I will be
glad to pop it back in place for you." Seven teased as she realized B'Elanna was
feeling better. B'Elanna couldn't help but laugh at the joke. Seven simply
smiled in that wonderful way of hers that few ever saw. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's head was now clear, but Seven's eyes were still locked with hers.
"Umm. Thanks for the cheering up Seven, I really needed it. In fact, my
headache's cleared right up." B'Elanna looked down to avoid the blue gaze. "You
are welcome Lieutenant." Seven said appreciatively while still holding onto
B'Elanna's shoulders.</P>
<P>B'Elanna brought her hands up to Seven's shoulders to steady herself and to
help herself stand back up. The soft silkiness of Seven's bio-suit surprised
B'Elanna as her hands unconsciously ran along Seven's shoulders. B'Elanna was
almost lost in the touch before she kicked herself back into reality. The two
stood their with each other's hands on each other's shoulders. B'Elanna once
again kicked back into fantasy as she once again locked eyes with the Beautiful
woman standing before her. For a moment both stood there silently lost in the
stare. B'Elanna's mouth grew dry as she took in the sweet smile of Seven's. She
couldn't help but smile back. The moment seemed perfect. </P>
<P>During the flash of images that ran through her mind during the headache,
B'Elanna was able to put together some of what happened last night. Although
extremely embarrassed by the situation, she realized that Seven wasn't. The kiss
she had shared with Seven continuously played through her mind, sometimes with
Seven as the recipient, sometimes with Claire. But she knew that no matter how
much she wished it was Claire, Seven was the true receiver of her passionate
kiss. </P>
<P>Blushing and finding it hard to breathe, B'Elanna found the courage to
apologize. "About last night Seven, I'm really sorry." B'Elanna found it harder
and harder to maintain eye contact. "What exactly are you apologizing for?"
Seven asked not understanding. </P>
<P>B'Elanna couldn't believe Seven was actually gonna make her say it. But then
again, maybe Seven really didn’t' know what she was apologizing for. "Well, you
know. The… thing that happened." B'Elanna hoped Seven caught on. </P>
<P>"Thing?" Seven crooked an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Yeah, the thing between us." B'Elanna pushed hoping she wouldn't have to go
into too much detail.</P>
<P>"Between us? Are you referring to when you kissed me or when I had my arms
draped around you as you put it this morning." Seven continued.</P>
<P>B'Elanna started to squirm. "Well I was thinking the former, but both I
guess." B'Elanna seemed a little relieved, although not by much. </P>
<P>"Strange, I did not know one apologized for kissing another person, nor did I
know one apologized for letting someone prevent them from freezing to death."
Seven sounded a little confused.</P>
<P>"Oh, well people usually don't kiss people who don't want to be kissed, so
that's why I apologized. As for the letting you save me from becoming an icicle.
Well, I guess that does sound a little stupid to be apologizing for right?"
B'Elanna dropped her hands from Seven's shoulders now aware of their position,
but as she did so her right hand briefly grazed Seven's breast. "Oh my God I
didn't mean to…" B'Elanna was now truly flustered.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at where B'Elanna's hand had briefly touched her breast. An
odd sensation had washed over her at the moment of contact. The same sensation
that she had felt when holding B'Elanna last night. Seven still held onto
B'Elanna's shoulders, not aware that she was tightening her grip. Staring at her
own breast, Seven finally let go of B'Elanna and touched the spot on her breast
that B'Elanna had so innocently made contact with. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's eyes grew wide at Seven touching her own breast. She couldn't
believe what was happening before her eyes. Mouth dry, no words coming, eyes
glued to the sight before her, B'Elanna was in a state of shock. </P>
<P>"Curious, what does one call this sensation?" Seven asked in her curious Borg
way as she slightly squeezed her breast. B'Elanna's knees were about to buckle,
and there was nothing to hold onto but the woman touching her breast in front of
her. "Ah, well, I, think you should ask the Doctor about that." Oh wait no, she
thought as the words left her mouth. "On the other hand don't say anything about
this to him, please?" B'Elanna pleaded, as she knew the Doctor was a one man
gossip machine. </P>
<P>"Very well, but can you tell me what I am experiencing?" Seven was now
massaging her breast, feelings of pleasure washing through her body. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was quickly looking around, making sure no one was watching. "I
think you should stop doing that before anyone sees." B'Elanna was genuinely
concerned that she would get caught watching Seven touch herself even though
they were basically on an empty planet, save for Ensign Parker. </P>
<P>"Is this not appropriate?" Seven asked. B'Elanna look exasperated. "Well, of
course not. People don't usually touch themselves in front of other people."
B'Elanna whispered to Seven. </P>
<P>"I am sorry, I did not know I was causing you discomfort." Seven removed her
hand from her breast, as it gently bounced back into place. "Is it normal for
people to touch others in front of other people as you did when you touched my
breast." </P>
<P>"That was an accident!" B'Elanna almost screamed. "I was just dropping my
hands and they accidentally grazed, well, you know?" B'Elanna said defensively.
</P>
<P>"I am sorry, I did not mean to accuse you of any inappropriate behavior."
Seven was apologizing far more than she ever had in her brief star fleet career.
</P>
<P>"That's okay, just as long as we forget this whole thing ever happened."
B'Elanna hoped she truly would, but knowing the Borg, that was damn near
impossible. </P>
<P>"As you wish Lieutenant." Seven was familiar with the whole pretending
something never happened thing. As she had caught many crew members performing
inappropriately while on duty. </P>
<P>With that finished, B'Elanna took the lead and continued the 2 km walk
towards the apple patch to look for their missing crew member. She hoped that
leading the way would avoid having to look at the nice slender body swaying back
and forth with blonde hair blowing through the wind. B'Elanna kept telling
herself that she wasn't attracted to Seven, but she knew she was lying. </P>
<P>Seven remained quiet the rest of the way, not wanting to disturb the
obviously flustered Lieutenant.</P>
