<!-- World Without Love \ Part 9 -->

<p>Seven of Nine was walking through Voyager's corridors heading towards Cargo bay 2, contemplating what she could have done wrong. Since B'Elanna had run away she was feeling like someone had ripped out her heart, but more so she was concerned that she had hurt B'Elanna with her actions. Did the half Klingon not share her feelings? Seven didn't even want to contemplate that, the thought of loving B'Elanna when the Klingon didn't return the feelings being too upsetting. Whatever it was Seven was determined to find B'Elanna and speak with her about it ..... but that would have to wait, first she had to think about her own feelings and perhaps a philosophical discussion with the captain was in order, philosophical meaning late at night.</p>

		<p>The ex-drone was startled when someone called out for her.</p>

		<p>"Seven may I speak to you for a moment?" It was Samantha Wildman, Naomi's mother and one of very few people Seven would actually call 'friend'. The Ensign was out of breath and a bit nervous, as it seemed.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Samantha?" Seven replied calmly.</p>

		<p>"Seven I know this is a big favour to ask for, but the captain assigned me to this mission to gather dilithium and food, and Neelix is put in command of another mission with the same purpose at the same time and I don't know what to do and you were the only one who came to my mind and ..... would you please take care of Naomi while I am on the mission?"</p>

		<p>The mother was clearly desperate not knowing who else to ask and therefore rambling. Seven was a little surprised at first, it was only rarely that Samantha was send on away missions and whenever that happened the captain made sure that Neelix was on the ship at that time so he could take care of the little girl. It seemed that that was not possible this time. Seven thought about what Sam asked of her and found that she could not decline, Naomi was her friend after all and so was Samantha, she was of course going to help.</p>

		<p>"Calm down Samantha, I will do it," she answered reassuringly, although she wasn't exactly aware of what this babysitting job what include and how long it would take. At least it would take her thoughts away from B'Elanna and the kiss. As she remembered the scene she felt a dull ache in her heart, but she immediately pulled away from the memory to concentrate on the present.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so very much Seven, you have no idea how much it will sooth my concerns of Naomi when I know she is in your care." Samantha looked relieved.</p>

		<p>'Weird', Seven thought, 'I'd have never thought someone would ever trust me, the cold Borg drone, enough to take care of their child, let alone be comfortable with such an arrangement.' Abandoning those thoughts she decided to ask the necessary questions.</p>

		<p>"When are you going, Samantha and how long will the mission last?" Seven asked to get to know how long she would be taking care of her little friend.</p>

		<p>Now Samantha began to uncomfortable again. "The mission starts in 3 hours and we will be gone at least 4 days, longer if we don't find the dilithium we are looking for. I know it is much to ask for, but I trust you with Naomi and the others I know ..... well they don't know Naomi as you do and......."</p>

		<p>Seven smiled slightly, "Samantha. Stop, I already said I would help. If I will have to look for Naomi day and night so to speak, can I sleep in your quarters? Cargo Bay 2 is not exactly the place for a child to sleep in."</p>

		<p>"Yes of course you can sleep in our quarters, but don't you need to regenerate?"</p>

		<p>"Not when I sleep and eat normally, then I only need to regenerate 2 hours a week," Seven explained, she seemed to think a little, "and now you need to go prepare your mission, I will take care of Naomi, I promise."</p>

		<p>The young Ensign looked a little unsure, then she nodded, "You're right. Thanks again Seven. Oh yeah I left you the list on the dining table in the quarters, but I guess with your eidetic memory you won't need it. And yeah ..... could you please take Naomi to Engineering to her appointment with Lieutenant Torres, you know Engineering is restricted and she is not allowed to go there alone. Seven are you alright?"</p>

		<p>While Samantha had been busy giving Seven her instructions, she albeit had noticed the hurt showing on Seven's face when she asked her to take Naomi to Engineering. Little did she know that the mentioning of the half-Klingon had brought that particular look on Seven's normally calm features.</p>

		<p>Seven looked a little confused, but quickly calm covered her face, once again. "No I am alright. And now go, Naomi and I will be fine." Samantha gave Seven a nod, "Okay, see you in four days," and hurried away to prepare the mission and say good-bye to her daughter.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>It was evening on Voyager. Seven was standing in front of the window of the Wildman family quarters. She had just put Naomi to bed, singing to the little half-Ktarian to get her to sleep. It had worked just fine. The little girl first listening intently to Seven's singing, but then gradually drifting away into sleep. And now Seven was standing in front of the window, watching the stars and contemplating the day.</p>

		<p>Working together with B'Elanna, then the lunch in mess hall, interrupted by her little friend, the talk with Kathryn, working away the afternoon in B'Elanna's quarters, ..... the kiss. B'Elanna's running away. It was just too much. Thankfully Sam had come along and now with taking care of Naomi she had something to occupy her thoughts with. Just ..... B'Elanna had a way of disrupting her thinking.</p>

		<p>Even now, watching the stars passing by all she could see was the half Klingon's face, panic written all over it. Yeah panic, but not disgust, no hate ..... perhaps, just perhaps she had feelings for Seven, and just didn't know how to handle them. 'Yeah, keep deluding yourself, face it you are so disgusting that she ran away from her own quarters.' It was unlike Seven to be sarcastic. 'It is also unlike you, to go and fall in love.' That last thought made her stop. She had never before really thought it quite so matter of factly, not even after her still unsure admission to her little friend. 'Face it, you are in love with her - how goes the song - truly, madly, deeply?'</p>

		<p>"I need to tell her," Seven breathed. "She probably thinks I am only attracted to her."</p>

		<p>This new thought brought back life into Seven's body, but she made herself stop, before she could hurry out and go to B'Elanna. 'Not tonight, you have to give her time and you need to sleep now, if you're not gonna regenerate.'</p>

		<p>Giving the stars outside of Voyager a last glance, Seven turned towards Samantha's bedroom, where she was going to sleep the next few days.</p>
