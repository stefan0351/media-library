<!-- What a Drag \ null -->

<p>"God, I can not believe this shit. It is just sooooo wrong,"
Sam grumbled as she stormed into her room and threw her jacket onto
the nearby desk. She let out a scream of frustration and fell face
first onto the bed. She kept screaming into the mattress, annoyed as
hell and then started banging her fists into the bed as well.</p>
<p>"As cute as watching you throw a 3 year olds tantrum is, Sam,
what the hell are you doing?" Brooke asked as she entered the room to
see Sam thrashing angrily on the bed.</p>
<p>(Heh, I'd like to see you thrashing on the bed due to
something else entirely.) Brooke smirked to herself. She then sighed.
(Yeah, cuz that would so happen. I seriously need to get over this
infatuation with Sam that I have going on)</p>
<p>Sam rolled over and glared at her stepsister.</p>
<p>"I just had the strangest, most disturbing night EVER!" Sam
complained. Brooke sat on the edge of the bed and frowned.</p>
<p>"Weren't you going to that club, uhm what was it called...
Detour?" she asked. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's an all lifestyles club that just opened and I was
going to watch the drag show and write an article about it," Sam
explained. She'd come out to her blended family not long after she
and Brooke had recovered from the events of Prom night, the whole
miserable and painful experience making her take a really long look
at herself and what she wanted out of life. Among the things that she
realized was that she was gay. After the accident, certain things
didn't seem as important or scary, like being gay. Nicole's drunken
driving spree had put a lot of things into perspective.</p>
<p>Of course, when she came out, Sam had left a few crucial
details out of the whole thing. Like her unrequited and maddeningly
deep crush on Brooke. Thankfully, the family had taken the news
surprisingly well and she and Brooke were closer instead of further
apart. Sam was beyond relieved; she'd been afraid that the lanky
blonde would be nervous around her or something. Oddly, the opposite
thing had happened and Brooke had actually started spending more time
with her instead.</p>
<p>"So, what? Did the club suck ass or something?" Brooke
wondered. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, the club was great. The show was fantastic and the
people were really friendly," Sam said, sitting up so that she was
next to Brooke, their thighs just barely touching. This was a game
that Sam liked to play; how close can I get to Brooke before she
pulls away. So far, Brooke didn't really pull away much. This game
was now Sam's favorite pastime.</p>
<p>"So why was it such a bad night?" Brooke asked. Sam groaned
and flopped back down. After she was quiet for a few minutes, Brooke
laid down next to her, propping herself up on one elbow and looking
down over Sam's prone figure.</p>
<p>(God, she is so hot! I wish I had the confidence to tell her
that I like her. But I'm scared that she'll think I'm just playing
with her or experimenting and I don't want her to hurt me) the blonde
thought dejectedly.</p>
<p>"Sam?" she called quietly. Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty right?" Sam asked silently. Brooke froze.</p>
<p>"Er...huh?" she managed. (Yeah, that was smooth McQueen)</p>
<p>"Look, I'll be honest with you," Sam said, looking up at the
blonde currently hovering above her. Swallowing the rising desire for
Brooke that was surfacing thanks to the images that their current
positions gave her, Sam sighed again.</p>
<p>"I didn't go to the club just to review it. I was kinda
hoping to meet someone," she confessed, embarrassed. Brooke nodded,
understanding.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I get that," she said, the feeling of rejection
stinging for a moment before she realized that she couldn't be
rejected if she didn't say anything about how she felt for Sam in the
first place.</p>
<p>"Anyway, there were a lot of cute girls there. Some even
asked me to dance," Sam continued with her story, unaware of the
thoughts of bodily harm to those girls that Brooke was currently
entertaining.</p>
<p>"Did you dance?" Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, a few times. But I'm new to this whole thing, Brooke.
I don't know the rules or what's expected. Am I allowed to like, wrap
an arm around someone as we dance or is that a no-no, you know?"</p>
<p>"Yeah ok," Brooke answered, not knowing the answer any more
than Sam did.</p>
<p>"So eventually, I ended up off the dance floor and in the
main room where the bar is, nursing a coke and feeling pretty damn
stupid," Sam complained.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy," Brooke breathed, thinking that was what had made
the night so sucky for her crush. She brushed some of Sam's dark hair
away from her eyes, relieved when Sam didn't pull away or look at her
strangely.</p>
<p>"That's not all, Brooke, the night got weirder," Sam informed
her blonde counterpart. Brooke nodded at her to continue.</p>
<p>"So I sat there and started talking to the bartender and a
few of the drag queens. They were all really nice and honestly, some
looked better in a dress that I do," she laughed. Brooke smiled,
loving the way Sam's mouth curved up when she laughed.</p>
<p>"I got to talking to this one queen, Abby, and we got joking
around about my single status and he told me how hot I was...I am hot...
well not hot maybe but I am pretty, right? At least cute?" Sam asked
insecurely. This time Brooke was able to form a coherent response.</p>
<p>"Sam, you know that you're attractive. Why the sudden
insecurity?" (Ok, you're so freaking hot I want to jump you right now
but no need to give you a big ego) Brooke thought to herself.</p>
<p>"Then why was the only offer I got all night from a GAY MAN!
A GAY MAN IN DRAG, for Christ's sake! He only likes guys and made
that so very clear and then was like 'you're hot and if I was into
girls I would totally be interested'. What is wrong with me?"</p>
<p>Brooke winced. (Yeah I can see why that would confuse her.
Having a gay man hit on you is a tad odd. And yet I feel relieved.
Shame on me)</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with you, Sammy. If none of those
girls were smart enough to see how beautiful and great you are then
it's their loss, you know?" Sam frowned.</p>
<p>"You think I'm beautiful?" she asked timidly. (I can't be
reading Brooke all wrong, can I? Lately I've been getting these
signals that she's interested...in ME. God I don't even want to dare
hope)</p>
<p>Seeing the door of opportunity suddenly open with the hopeful
and longing look in Sam's eyes, Brooke decided to take the risk. She
reached out with her free hand and lightly traced Sam's dark eyebrow
with her finger, the simple touch far more intimate than anything
they'd shared thus far. She then traveled down over Sam's cute nose
before cupping the silent girl's cheek with the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>"I think you're very beautiful," the blonde said very softly.
They stared at each other for several long minutes.</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke whispered. Sam blinked a few times but stayed
focused intently on the blonde cheerleader.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" she responded in the same soft tone.</p>
<p>"I...I uh..." Brooke stopped and licked her lips. "I really want
to kiss you right now." (There, I said it. Now as long as she doesn't
slap me or run off I might live)</p>
<p>Sam gasped and felt her heart leap to her throat. Brooke
sighed.</p>
<p>(She gasped. She doesn't want to kiss me. She's not
interested) she thought dejectedly.</p>
<p>"Never mind, I'm sorry," she apologized, her voice barely
audible. She looked down, unable to look at Sam anymore and tried not
to let the tears she felt burning her eyes fall.</p>
<p>"Yes," Sam said suddenly. Brooke frowned and looked back up
at Sam. Her hand still hadn't moved away from Sam's face.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I want you to kiss me. I want to kiss you," Sam said in
a rush. She didn't want this wonderful chance to pass by without
taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>"Please?" she added, hoping not to sound desperate. She
desperately wanted to kiss Brooke but her pride didn't want her to
make it obvious. Brooke smiled and traced Sam's lips with her thumb.</p>
<p>Without a word, Brooke leaned over and pressed her lips into
Sam's, savoring their softness and taste. Sam's hand came up to wrap
itself in silky blonde hair and pull Brooke closer to deepen the
kiss. Sam's head swam when she felt Brooke's tongue lick her lips
for permission to deepen the kiss even more. She whimpered when
Brooke's hot tongue slipped past her lips, tangling with her own. The
whimper changed to a low vibrating moan when she then felt Brooke
shift and drape her long body over Sam's own. The weight of Brooke's
body against her, the feel of their breasts pressed together even
through their layers of clothes, lit a fire inside Sam.</p>
<p>As they continued to kiss, hands started to roam and their
hips began to unconsciously grind against each other. They were
panting into each other's mouths, moans and gasps mingling together
filling the room as their kisses grew more frantic and wanting.</p>
<p>"Sam, oh God Sam I've wanted you for so long," Brooke panted
into Sam's ear. Sam let out a whine from the back of her throat. She
grasped Brooke's head in her hands and moved her so that their
foreheads were touching.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you say?" she asked, staring into Brooke's
arousal darkened hazel eyes. Brooke stared right back at her.</p>
<p>"I was scared," she admitted, biting her lip.</p>
<p>"Scared that I'd freak?" Sam wondered. Brooke nodded, still
keeping eye contact. "Yeah, me too." Brooke's face broke out into a
wide grin.</p>
<p>"So you feel the same?" she asked hopefully. A matching smile
illuminated Sam's features. Instead of speaking, Sam pulled the
cheerleader back down into a fiery kiss that said everything Brooke
needed to know.</p>
