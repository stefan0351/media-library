<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Eight -->

<p>Three weeks. It took three very long weeks for me to finally get out
of the hospital. First they wanted me to be able to stand up. Then I
had to be able to walk. And Finally I had to be able to get around on
my own. All the feeling came back eventually.</p>
<p>But still, it took three weeks. I was out of my world for three
weeks. Well, I wasn't completely out of the world for three weeks.
Helena and Dinah kept me pretty connected. They were by my side when
they really didn't have to be. I should probably be thankful for that
too, but I'm not.</p>
<p>I could have handled everything just fine on my own. I didn't need
them by my side constantly reminding me that I'm not one of them,
that no matter what I do I'll never be one of them. Helena says it
doesn't matter to her, but I know that it does. What other reason
would she have for hooking up with her younger partner?</p>
<p>They're the same. They think they have this special connection that
I'll never be able to share. I'm not even sure I'd want to share it
anyway. It'd be a big responsibility. I mean Dinah must have tons of
problems. She has to be careful with who she touches because she just
might fall into their minds and never get out. And Helena is stronger
than most people are. She's stronger than I am. I can just imagine
what would happen if she didn't check her strength when she was
dealing with us normal people.</p>
<p>I'll never stop needing their help though. I'll always need them by
my side when I'm dealing with some...well when I'm dealing with some
lizard lady who spits poison at me. I'll need them when I can't
handle the situation on my own or when the law falls short and won't
allow me to do my job. I need them. I don't want to need them, but I
need them.</p>
<p>At one time, I actually thought they'd let me be a part of their
group. I thought that maybe they needed me as much as I needed them
but I was wrong. I at least thought that maybe Helena and I could be
something together, besides partners. She made me think that I had
found someone who I could share my life with and not have to hide
away the part of me that deals with the scum of New Gotham.</p>
<p>I bet she's having a good laugh at me now. I bet she's sitting up on
her rooftops and laughing. Laughing about how Reese fell for her
entire act and Dinah's probably right there with her. Or at least
that's how I wish it was. Then maybe I could actually be angry with
them and blame them for everything that has ever gone wrong in my
life, but I can't. I know that Helena feels bad about what happened
between us and I know that Dinah...well I'm pretty sure that Dinah
would love to rub it in my face that she got the grand prize in a
contest I didn't even know I was a part of, but I know she won't. I'm
sure she realizes having to see them together is almost more than I
can handle.</p>
<p>So here I am. Waiting on the both of them again standing over some
dead body that was killed with some very nasty poison from a lady who
looks like a lizard. I will always need their help more than they
will ever need mine.</p>
<p>"Hey," Helena from behind me. I don't even bother to turn around.</p>
<p>"Hey. We've got another one."</p>
<p>Helena walks up next to me and looks down at the body then takes a
quick look around. I know she's searching for the lady who did this,
but she's not going to find her. I've already looked and I couldn't
find a damn thing. I notice Dinah's not with her and am curious. Did
they have a fight? Are they patrolling different parts of the city?
Is Dinah hurt?</p>
<p>"You ever wonder why she came back to the scene of that last murder?"
She asks bending down over the body.</p>
<p>I shrug even though I know she can't see me do it. "Yeah I wonder
about that all the time. She almost killed me that night. I tend to
wonder about the circumstances often."</p>
<p>She turns to me and her eyes capture mine for a long moment. I know
she wants to say something but she doesn't. She just nods and looks
back at the body.</p>
<p>"You ever come up with a theory of why she came back?" She asks her
head still bent down.</p>
<p>"The only thing different about that night was that you weren't here
and Dinah was."</p>
<p>That gets Helena's attention. She stands up and backs away from the
body. "Do you think the woman wants something from Dinah?"</p>
<p>There's fear in her voice and I'm almost sorry that I put it there.
Makes me kind of wish that I had an answer for her too. "I don't
know, but do you notice something about all the people she's been
killing. You see a trend?"</p>
<p>Helena's about to say no but it stops right on the tip of her tongue.
She realizes what I'm talking about. She realizes that every single
woman that has been killed has blonde hair, blue eyes, and is about
the same height as Dinah. I'm surprised Oracle hasn't informed them
of this very unique trend. I'm even more surprised that they haven't
realized it themselves. I guess they just choose to be blissfully
ignorant.</p>
<p>"I've got to go," She tells me backing away from the body and backing
away from me.</p>
<p>I look down at the concrete ground. "Helena if it helps, I don't
think she wants to bring harm to Dinah," I say but when I look back
up I know Helena hasn't heard a thing I've said because she's gone.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>I'm back at the department filling out all my paperwork for the night
and I have this ball of tension in my stomach. Ever since I've left
that crime scene earlier tonight I can't help but think of the look
Helena gave me once I told her my theory. No one may believe me now,
but I really don't want anything to happen to Dinah. I truly don't.
She's just a kid and she doesn't deserve any crazy person out there
having it in their sick mind to mess with her.</p>
<p>I don't want anyone to touch her and I'll do whatever I can to keep
her safe. The girl saved my life, it's really the least I can do.
Plus, well I think I care for her. I don't think I can help caring
about her. She has this thing. It's probably the same thing that made
Helena...well it's probably behind part of the reason Helena and I
aren't together anymore.</p>
<p>I know the girl can protect herself, but I don't want her to have to.</p>
<p>"You're working awfully late tonight detective," a voice calls out to
me through the darkness of the corner. "I'm glad to see that you're
up and walking again."</p>
<p>I remain seated at my desk. I don't want this woman to think that I'm
a threat to her now. The last time I did that I was in the hospital
for three weeks.</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>She steps out of the shadows slowly and languidly walks to the chair
across from my desk to take a seat. "I want you to trust me."</p>
<p>She must be crazy. Maybe she's getting high off of her own
poison. "Like I said, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"I came to you because I think you're the only one who will actually
listen to me and see sense."</p>
<p>Okay the way she's talking has kind of got me scared. "I'm listening."</p>
<p>She shakes her head. "No you're not. But you will be."</p>
<p>The woman's crazy. "Just tell me what you got to say?"</p>
<p>Reptilian lady crosses her legs and leans back in the chair. "I want
her and I want you to bring her to me."</p>
<p>She's talking about Dinah. I know she is but still. "Who?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head. "Please don't Detective. I don't want you
playing stupid with me. I know you to be an educated man."</p>
<p>I sigh. "Fine. Why do you want her?"</p>
<p>"She can do something for me. Something I haven't been able to get
from anyone else."</p>
<p>"Is that why you're killing all these people? You're just looking for
something?"</p>
<p>She nods her head once. "I thought that if I just got someone close
enough...well it doesn't matter because it doesn't work."</p>
<p>"What are you trying to do?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure that you're aware of how special our young Canary is?"</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>"Well I need her special skills to help me on a project of mine and
that's all you need to know."</p>
<p>"Listen," My voice is firm, "if you seriously expect me to help you
out then you've got to tell me what the hell you've got planned for
her."</p>
<p>"Well...how about I just tell you that if you help me I'll let her live
and if you don't then I'll not only kill her, but I'll also kill you
and the woman who protects her."</p>
<p>Now I don't think she could lay a hand on Helena...me on the other
hand, but I don't care about me. "If I help you out then Huntress is
going to kill me anyway."</p>
<p>The woman raises her brow. "Huntress? Is that her name?"</p>
<p>Okay I'm supposed to be getting information not giving it. "I don't
think that really matters."</p>
<p>She smiles mockingly at me. "No I guess it doesn't."</p>
<p>"So what do you want with her?"</p>
<p>"You are persistent, Detective, aren't you?"</p>
<p>I don't answer her. I only wait for a response to my question.</p>
<p>"I'll give you a few days to think about it," she stands and brushes
off the front of her green leather pants. "If you tell anyone about
our conversation then I'll make sure that they all die anyway."</p>
<p>I stand up slowly, still not wanting to make her feel threatened. "I
don't turn on my friends."</p>
<p>She stands up straight and cocks her hide to the side. "Your friends
Detective? Tell me, where are your friends now?"</p>
<p>I don't answer, mostly because I don't have an answer. I don't know
where they are.</p>
<p>"You don't know do you Detective? And that's because they don't want
you to know. You're not their friend, Detective, you're their pawn."</p>
<p>"Well at least they're on the right side."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. But do you know what the greater good is, Detective?"</p>
<p>I really wish she would stop calling me that.</p>
<p>"The greater good, Detective, is getting me that girl. What is one
life-- one solitary life-- compared to all the others I'll have to
kill until I get to one that is like her? Do you want one girl's
blood on your hands or do you want twenty...fifty...a hundred? I won't
stop, Detective, until I get what I want."</p>
<p>"So you're saying that once you get her then you're going to stop
killing?" I shake my head. "Call me crazy, but I don't believe that."</p>
<p>"I'm only looking for someone strong enough, Detective, and she's the
one. Once I have her I have no reason to continue my search."</p>
<p>"I still don't believe you."</p>
<p>She shrugs. "Believe what you will."</p>
<p>"Why do you need my help? You seem to have been getting along just
fine without any help." Now I'm just curious. What would she ever
want me to do? Stop Helena? That's not possible.</p>
<p>"Trust is a luxury I do not have."</p>
<p>I snort. "So you want me to betray their trust?"</p>
<p>"It's the greater good, Detective."</p>
<p>"You've got the wrong man."</p>
<p>She shrugs. "Possibly...but I don't think I do."</p>
<p>"Think what you want."</p>
<p>She reaches into the pocket of her green leather jacket and I can't
help but back away. I know what this woman is capable of. She just
grins at me. She knows I'm afraid of her and I think she enjoys it,
but then again most crazies do. She pulls out a card from the inside
pocket and hands it out to me. "Don't worry, Detective, it's
perfectly safe."</p>
<p>I slowly reach out and take it. There's nothing on there but a first
name and number. I'm sure Oracle could find more than enough
information on this crazy just by the number and name. I'll be sure
to get it to her as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"I know you're a very loyal man, Detective, but I feel that if a man
can turn in his own father then he'll have no problem handing over a
young girl who will only be missed by a very selective few. Call me."
</p>
<p>She walks away from me without even one look back. I'm standing at my
desk holding her card in my hand and I'm actually considering her
offer. Oracle and Huntress got along just fine before without Dinah,
from what I understand.</p>
<p>I know trusting the bad guy is never a good idea. I think this one's
different though. She didn't hurt Dinah and I when she had the chance
that night. She didn't do anything but defend herself.</p>
<p>"Hey Reese why am I not surprised to find you here?" Helena suddenly
appears before me. I quickly place the card in my pocket hoping that
she doesn't question me about it.</p>
<p>"I was just finishing up my paper work," I point to the paper
littering my desk. "Did you need something?"</p>
<p>She shrugs. "Not really. I just wanted to see how you were doing on
your first day back."</p>
<p>"Actually," Dinah calls from across the room. "We wanted to see how
your first day back was."</p>
<p>I'm surprised that they're together...here together especially after
Helena's earlier enlightenment this evening.</p>
<p>"Well as you can see," I spread my arms out, "I'm still alive."</p>
<p>Dinah walks up to Helena and takes place beside her. They actually do
look good together. They fit. There's no place for me though.</p>
<p>"And you're going to have to take it easy if you want to stay that
way," Dinah tells me. "So get your stuff and let's go."</p>
<p>"Go where?" I ask grabbing my jacket from the back of my chair.</p>
<p>"We're taking you home," Dinah reaches out and grabs my hand. "You've
got to take care of yourself."</p>
<p>I glance at Helena asking her with my eyes if this is some sort of
joke and Helena just shakes her head and smiles.</p>
<p>"You are aware that I can take myself home aren't you?" I ask Dinah
even though I don't resist her pulling.</p>
<p>"You're also a workaholic and need guidance when it comes to such
things as taking care of yourself." Dinah responds while she
continues to pull me away from my desk and unfinished work.</p>
<p>Helena follows us out only a few steps behind. She's smirking at us
or rather at me.</p>
<p>"Do you think I'm just going to let you drag me about like this?" I
ask pulling back a little.</p>
<p>Dinah stops completely then just looks at me for a moment. "Well...
yeah."</p>
<p>This girl is something else. "Fine. Take me home."</p>
<p>Dinah smiles and lets go of my hand. She looks behind me to Helena
and sticks out her tongue. "I told you he'd listen to me."</p>
<p>Helena rolls her eyes and takes a few quick steps then Dinah is
suddenly in her arms. They lose their selves into each other and I
feel like I should look away. I shouldn't be exposed to this. This is
theirs alone and not mine to share. I wonder if Oracle ever feels the
same way.</p>
