<p><b>Hey guys! It's me. I'm still working on "Collision Course Memories," and I have to warn you "It's a Curse" is on hold as of now. That is, if any of you guys are reading it, lol.

I must give you guys props if you do. </b></p>
<p><b>It's funny how I got this idea. I was at a swimming party with a bunch of my friends and we were taking sooo many pictures, lol. And I saw a gorgeous picture of Ryan Reynolds =D</b></p>
<p><b>Please tell me if you like it or not. Review! I'm still new to the Hannah/Lola thing. Like I don't know which name to use when Miley or Lilly isn't talking. And of course, constructive criticism is <u>very</u> helpful. I would love it if you guys leave a review!</b></p>

<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;"><b>C H A P T E R O N E: PHOTOSHOOTING<br>
</b></p>
<p>It's interesting to see how models work in photoshoots. Not to mention intriguing. Especially when Miley's doing it. Or should I say Hannah. Even when she's not wearing anything too revealing (well, in my case, bikinis aren't <i>that</i> revealing when she's wearing it), it's like magic or something. The way she pouts her lips, poses, maybe even slightly sticking her butt out…there's something about it. Or like when she dances to the music playing in the background and she's swaying her hips side to side. It's like I'm instantly parched and my body gets this…high-ish feeling. But that's only when I'm looking at her.</p>
<p>And I notice this how? I have no freakin' clue. I think it actually started before school started last year, around the end of summer. Oliver, our beloved doughnut, decided that it would be fun if we had a sleepover, since it was our last week of summer and our days were finally reaching to be upperclassmen. Of course, since Oliver, being the stupid perv he is, thought "it would be cool if Miley and Lilly were to make out…Just 'cuz." And this wasn't exactly the first time we were asked this. Somehow, me and Miley's close proximity makes us look like we're a lesbian couple. That we're too touchy-feely for just only being best friends. So in response, we slapped him and made him sleep in hell on earth: Jackson's room.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this was an insult to me and Miley, but I thought about it. And thought about it. And thought about it. And I noticed things. I noticed how our knees conveniently touch once in awhile, our hands accidentally brushing, our heads leaning on each other's shoulders, sometimes when we walk side-by-side, we usually hold hands, and when we hug, most of the time, I close my eyes and let our bodies just hold each other. Most of all I noticed the feelings that come with the touches. I have to say, they felt great. My heart jumps, my body tingles, and my brain goes into overdrive.</p>
<p>It didn't exactly hit me until Oliver kissed me in front of Rico's, that is. This happened a few days after he asked Miley and I to make out in front of him. It felt weird and rough. And also random. I mean, I can't compare him to Miley, 'cuz, well…I've never kissed her before. Which is a weird thought, because why would I want to kiss her? I have no stinkin' clue. Although I'd like to know why.</p>
<p>But then again, I don't want to 'cuz then Miley and others would think I'm a freak. And I also decided to say yes to Oliver and I thought that the feelings with Miley were just a phase, nothing else. Just a work of the naïve mind.</p>
<p>When I told Miley that I was going out with Oliver, or more like when she found us making out in her living room, she looked pretty devastated. But that must've been my mind; I could've been overreacting. Maybe she was like that because we decided to keep it a secret and not tell Miley until the time felt right.</p>
<p>But the time never felt right. There was always this guilt or something that was eating up my guts. The more I hung out with the both of them at the same time, the more smaller I felt. I didn't like it one bit, but I didn't want Oliver to feel bad and the same goes to Miley. And when Miley and I had our girls' night out, Oliver always texted me and maybe sometimes even call me. I could tell she felt like the third wheel and I didn't blame her. I'd feel the same way, too. So whenever Oliver called or texted me, or when we have our girls' night out/in, I always turn off my phone.</p>
<p>He got mad, though, when I did something like that. It got really annoying whenever he whined about, too. Then we got into fights, which Miley tried to prevent us from. It didn't work. Eventually, we broke up. I never knew how much it actually hurt. And in actuality, we just broke up days ago. One year of being a couple together, thirteen years of being best friends, finally broke. Good thing Miley's there for me. I don't think I could ever repay her for what she's done for me.</p>
<p>Like right now, since she felt sorry for me, she wanted to ditch school and bring me with her. And that brings us here in Hannah's photoshoot for…Wait, what was this for again?</p>
<p>"Excuse me, what photoshoot is this for?"</p>
<p>"Uh, duh, Entertainment Weekly?" the woman scoffs and rolls her eyes. "Look at the sign above you," she yells back as she walks away.</p>
<p>Oh. "Oh, well thanks very much for your help," I scoff back. Gosh, that sounded dumb. It's not my fault though, I was preoccupied.</p>
<p>I glance back at Hannah then to my watch, and then back to Hannah. She's been at it for at least two and a half hours, and she's still not showing any signs of fatigue. We started shooting around eleven in the morning and Mr. S said that photoshoots could go for however the photographer wants it to go. And here I am watching her 'work it,' as what Ricardo the photographer said. I swear she could never slow down.</p>
<p>"Ok, guys," he begins to say in his Hispanic accent, "time for break tres. We will be up again in fifteen, 'kay? Great!" he squealed and went inside the translucent tent. Oh, did I forget to mention that we're currently shooting outside, on the beach? Huntington Beach, to be exact. It's really nice here, except it's not that fun when you're wearing long tight pants, boots, a super thick plaid jacket, and a thick wig.</p>
<p>"Y'know, Miles, you coulda told me that we were gonna go to a beach!" I seethe to her ear as I pull her towards me. I mean, just so she can get away from the bombarding fans, that's all. Not that I want to smell her scent or anything, psshh.</p>
<p>"Sorry! I just wanted to surprise you, that's all," she shrugs as she puts on her purple and yellow silk robe.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm definitely having fun in the sun, <i>Hannah</i>." Beads of sweat start to show in my forehead as I remain standing behind Hannah's mirror. She sits down and gives me a cold drink. I take it gratefully and chug down nearly two thirds of the bottle.</p>
<p>"Hey, save some for the popstar!" she teased. I give it back and sit down on the folding chair set next to Hannah's specialized chair. "So, what do you think?" she asks, still looking at the mirror.</p>
<p>I look up to where she's looking and glance at her eyes. She has the most beautiful gray-blue eyes. They're so dynamic and so full of emotion. "What do I think of what?"</p>
<p>"The photoshoot, duh." She leans in closer to the mirror and stretches her face.</p>
<p>"It's going great. You're lookin' pretty hot, Hannah." Oh yea, I said that. In fact, I've said that so many times, even when I was dating Oliver. Ha, talk about desperate. And I don't think she's ever noticed.</p>
<p>"Aw, thanks, Lola. You sure know how to make people smile," and she smiles a big grin and I grin back. Her laugh and smiles are so contagious, I don't even know how to stay mad at her for a long time.</p>
<p>Next to us, we hear yelling and screaming. Ugh, sometimes, I wished they'd just shut up and leave us alone in peace and quiet. But I shouldn't say that because I used to be like that when I didn't know Miley was Hannah. Now that was a turn of events.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess I should go and do autographs," she sighs and picks up her Hannah pen. Boy, the price that comes with popularity. When she walked over to the railing that was lined up with police officers and bodyguards, the fans screamed "I love you!" a lot more louder, if it were even any more possible. Oy, this is just the only time I want to go home.</p>
<p>"Hannah, darling! Time for shooting again!" Ricardo squeaks loudly from the set. It's funny how he says 'again.' The way he says it sounds like we're gaining something.</p>
<p>Hannah walks and waves to her fans and took off her robe…ever…so…slowly. And now my throat is parched again and my body heats up more than it should be. Then she flips her hair oh-so-casually. It's like she's doing it on purpose or something! But not for me though. I'm guessing it's for the boys who have their mouths agape…and a disgusting bump below their waistline.</p>
<p>As she walks—or maybe it's called strutting in her definition—her way over to Ricardo and his staff, she talks to them in an intense conversation. I wonder what that's all about. She's using her hands and everything. And usually whenever she does that, it's very important.</p>
<p>I glance over around the whole set. The platform's back was facing the little townhouses and apartments aligned across from the beach we're using. Flashing lights, tents, huge mobile fans (for when the wind wasn't in the breeze), and canvas stands put beside the long and tall lights; it was hectic. A power generator was put out near Ricardo's staff's tent and cables connected to it lead to the set where Hannah is now.</p>
<p>Speaking of Hannah, she's pointing at me. She's yelling at me to come over. Oh god, what now, Miley?</p>
<p>I walk over reluctantly and meet n' greet Ricardo and his right hand partner, Lucy. From up-close, Ricardo looks pretty cute, a bit lanky, but muscular in his own way. His long black hair is tied up loosely near the back of his neck. Lucy had glasses that looked just like my own, and had a petite figure. She's a blonde and her hair is pulled back to a tight bun. I'm guessing she's more of the agent type person.</p>
<p>"So, Lola, I hear you're Hannah's bestie?" Ricardo asks. His eyes survey my body from my head to my toes, but mostly around my stomach area and thighs. Miley held my hand in a tight grasp. I don't know where this is going, but I have a weird feeling about it. Ricardo holds his Nikon camera in one hand and the other hand on his hip. He pops his knee out and holds his place by leaning on his right leg. "She will do," he says approvingly and Hannah over here standing next to me starts to jump up and down.</p>
<p>"Eeep!" Hey, that's my eep! "Yay! Oh my gosh, this'll be so much fun!"</p>
<p>My heads starts to bob up and down trying to understand what she's saying. "Hannah, stop." I put my hands on her shoulders. "What will I do?"</p>
<p>"C'mon, ladies, we do not have all day! Quickly! Someone give the pink haired girl a bathing suit! Chop chop!"</p>
<p>What? "Hannah, I'm gonna do what?" My voice squeaks. I mean, I wear swimsuits like all the time, but for modeling? I've never done that before. And personally, I don't like where this is going.</p>
<p>"Oh, c'mon Lola, it'll be fun! Remember you said one day that you'd want to model?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't, Hannah. You're the one who said that," I whisper the last part, "when you were Miley!" God, even though she means it for good intentions, she can be so infuriating. "And I'm not even ready yet!"</p>
<p>"Well, I meant that we should model together one day. This is the perfect chance!" And there she goes using her puppy dog eyes and pout. "Pwetty pwease, Wowa?"</p>
<p>I roll my eyes and scoff. "Fine, but don't think that you're done with this." As soon as I said that, she drags me to her other tent that is covered. I never noticed the many racks of clothing there were. She then leads me to a small changing room in the corner of the tent.</p>
<p>"Ok, your clothes are in there," she says and opens the curtain. I see nothing but two pairs of string bikinis hung opposite from me and a mirror to the left. "I chose one for you and my make-up artist chose the other one." She pushes me inside and I hesitate.</p>
<p>"Mil—"but she beats me to it.</p>
<p>"Now choose one quickly, or Ricky'll get really mad." She winks at me and the curtain rings as they close. "Hurry! I'll be waiting!"</p>
<p>Dear god. I am so screwed. I'm usually the one that's self-conscious of my body, no matter how many people say I look hot. I mean, that's great they think I'm hot, but my body can be just so…blah sometimes. And string bikinis? Is this even allowed? We're only eighteen! I'd happily wear this elsewhere, but not for a national top-selling magazine. But I have to make Miley happy. I mean, if she's happy, then I'm happy. It's the least I could do since she's done everything for me.</p>
<p>And…maybe…I could show off my body I worked off with beach soccer…just for the pictures, I mean. Not for her, pffftt.</p>
<p>I held the one hung on the right. It's the same as Hannah's white pair only except instead of the HM logo on the right, it said my own Lola Luftnagle logo with the calligraphy L on the left cup. I take the other one and put it in front of me. Another string bikini except it was red and plaid and had the same L calligraphy logo patched on the left side. Both look really cute and I really don't know which one to pick.</p>
<p>I peek my head out and look for Hannah. Darn she's not here. Ugh, the choices I have to make. If I choose the plaid one, it'll look like my own style. But then it'll just look like I'm desperate for attention because of its bright red color. If I choose the white one, which I noticed had bright faux, clear jewels aligned on the sides; it'll look like Hannah and Lola have really good taste, and that we're matching buddies. But then it'll look like we're a bunch of snobby people who thinks that we'll start a trend again by matching outfits. Dang, I should've done 'eenie-meenie-minne-moe' from the start.</p>
<p>Ok, I just have to find out which one Miley chose for me, then that'll make her happy. I glance at both swim wear that's hung on the wall. Ugh, this is useless.</p>
<p>"Lola, honey! Shoots starts in three!" I hear Ricardo say. Sighing, I pick the white one and just go with it. I hope Miley picked this one.</p>
<p>As I walk out of the tent with a purple towel, which I conveniently found lying on the table, I tighten the grasp. Never in my life did I blush so hard. Especially when I saw Miley gaping at me. Oh no, is my wig on? I touch my head. Oh, ok. It's on. Then why is she staring at me like that?</p>
<p>Actually, I'd rather stop thinking about that now and not get too far.</p>
<p>"Ok, honey, if you want ta do a photoshoot, you're gonna have ta lose that flimsy towel and show off your hot bod." Lucy lowers her glasses and eyes me from top to bottom, probably second guessing about the choice Ricardo made.</p>
<p>I sigh and close my eyes. "Okay…" I do so and blush yet again. I don't know why I'm blushing all of a sudden, but I really need to stop now. It's embarrassing.</p>
<p>"Wow, Lil—I mean, Lola," I hear her say. I perk up. "Daaang, you've got one hell of hot bod," she winks again.</p>
<p>I grin and bite my lip. "Thanks," I approach Hannah and Ricardo gapes with his fellow workers. And again, I blush.</p>
<p>"She's a hottie!" Ricardo says jubilantly. "And a cutie! Oh, so adorable! Come, come. Go stand on the platform."</p>
<p>Carefully walking up the stairs with bare feet, I hold her hand not wanting to trip and embarrass myself in front of people I don't even know. Here's that feeling again. It's coming from my right hand that's being dragged by her, and it's leading up to my body. I shudder as she wraps an arm loosely around my waist and brings me closer to her.</p>
<p>Well, what am I supposed to do now? All I'm thinking about is how close I am to her. And especially that I'm so thankful that I shaved last night. Whew.</p>
<p>"Put your arm around me," she whispers, still smiling to Ricardo. Stupidly, I look behind her. Where do I put my arm? God, we already have sunlight, why do we artificial lighting? "Around my waist, Lola," she spells out for me.</p>
<p>Oh, that makes sense. I do so and Ricardo and his co-workers exclaim. "Oh, dis is so, so, so, <i>so</i> adorable! Oh! Cue the music!" Techno music played from the background and I smile bigger. This could be really fun. "Wait! Lucifer, check the girl's make-up." Lucifer runs up the small set of stairs and takes out a glitter blush brush out from his make-up belt. Tickling my body, he quickly brushes it over my face, arms, shoulders, literally any visible part showing, and takes out a lip shiner and applies it on my lips. Yum, pink lemonade. "Ok. Now…Let us make some <i>magic</i>," he growls.</p>
<p>There's something in my gut that's making me sweat. Maybe it's Miley, but that wouldn't be fair if I blame her. I'll just blame the artificial lighting. But when Miley starts to dance like the dancer she is when she's on stage, I don't know what it is, but there's something in the atmosphere that makes me want to actually pose in front of the camera. I follow her lead and start dancing horribly. We laugh, I smile, I pout, I pose. It's all so new to me, and I think I'm kinda starting to like it. And it kinda feels like we're flirting with each other. Which is very nice, of course.</p>
<p>My body must be hot to touch right now. I am <i>burning</i>. And this time, I am not blaming the lighting or the bright flashing lights that are blinding me. As I glance around from the corner of my eye, I see the spectators from before gaping at us, taking their own pictures from the disposable ones. Hey, are they even allowed to do that?</p>
<p>"Hey, Ricky!" Hannah yells which scared the crap out of me. "Can we try something different?" Something different?</p>
<p>"Something different? Do you not like the location of this place?" He looks exasperated. That's not good. "And what do you think would be a better idea than <i>my</i> fabulous idea?"</p>
<p>She jumped down to the front and boy, did I notice that. I mean, anyone could notice Hannah Montana's stuff jiggling…</p>
<p>I clear my throat and walk down the stairs, not exactly wanting to make a scene like what Hannah did.</p>
<p>"Listen, Ricardo," she tries to calm him down as he fans himself, glaring at Hannah. "We're at a beach! Maybe we should do something that's beach-related, dont'cha think so?"</p>
<p>"Aren't the bikinis enough? What more could we do?"</p>
<p>"Well, maybe instead of just standing on the platform, maybe we could play in the water, pretend that we're tanning on the lounge chairs, something summer-on-the-beach-like, y'know?"</p>
<p>Playing in the water, isn't that dangerous with our wigs, Miley? What in the world is she thinking? I stand next to her and nudge her. As usual she shrugs it of and ignores me. God, I hate it when she does that, it's so annoying.</p>
<p>Ricardo's angered face changes in an instance. "You know, that could be wonderful! Oh, Hannah, sweetie! I love you so, so, so, <i>so</i> much! Everyone, get ready, we will be doing different scenes! Hurry, while the sun is still out and shining!" Instantly the crew and staff, everyone, grabs as much as stuff if they could and ran around the beachfront.</p>
<p>"Well, Hannah," I say, covering my bare stomach, "what are you up to?" Her face becomes devious and she gives me that sheepish half-smile that drives me nuts.</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll see. It'll be really fun, trust me," she nods and that gives me uncertainty. "Hey, you wore that bikini! It's the one I chose! Girl, you have great taste!"</p>
<p>"You just noticed now?" I laugh. "Thanks, great minds think alike," I point to my head.</p>
<p>"Well, your hot bod—"she stopped and it looks like she caught herself before she says something bad. "I mean, I-I was busy with uh," she clears her throat and I look at her with a confused look. She looks off behind me. I turn around and see the Hannah tent being closed and moved very quickly. Nothing else interesting really. Then I feel hands on my arms that quickly turn me around.</p>
<p>"Uh-um, stay here, and let me get the robes for a sec." She zooms right past me and I watch her run towards Lucifer and Lucy. Well that was really weird. And now here I am, standing with a light pink wig, half naked for a photoshoot. On the beach. Wow, I never knew all that would be in one sentence that applies to me.</p>
<p>"Here ya go," she hands me the robe I found from the table inside the tent. "So, I was thinking, maybe we could splash around in the water and stuff. I think they'll like it. It'll look pretty cute." Not to mention hot, I'd say. Seeing Miley, or Hannah, in a bikini <i>and</i> wet, that's a lot. Score! It'll be like harmless flirting, too! It's a win-win situation. Perfect.</p>
<p>"My dear ladies, come over here. We will do tanning in the sun first. Come on, we are wasting precious sunlight!" Ricardo leads us to a pair of colorful lounge chairs. In between them is a little table stand with a stack Entertainment Weekly magazines, probably just for an advertisement. "Ok, you," he says to me. "You cute-a lit-tle girl," he smiles at me. Nice save, I smile back. "You sit here and show off your wonderful tanned legs." Rolling my eyes, I take off my robe and sit almost too seductively for my taste and take a magazine from the stack. Mmm, Ryan Reynolds is lookin' <i>fine</i>. But, clearly, not as fine as Hannah. "Wonderful! Oh, just so wonderful! You are a natural! Ah, you are Ricardo's new favorite, you," he squeals.</p>
<p>I force out a laugh. "Thanks. I'll keep that in mind." Then he instructs Hannah the same thing. A few minutes later, we sit across from each other reading Entertainment Weekly. A person gives us each a pair of cute sunglasses. I glance to Hannah to see if she's wearing hers. Dang she looks really cute right now. And that smile totally finishes it off.</p>
<p>"C'mon ladies, show me the <i>sexy</i>. Come, give it to Ricardo." Click by click by click, Ricardo took never ending pictures. I think by now, my stomach's tanner than my back. "Lola, honey, sit next to Hannah. Both of you guys read the same magazine." I sit next to Hannah and she scoots over. The seat's too uncomfortable, but she wraps an arm around my shoulders and I cuddle in closer to her. That's right, <i>cuddle</i>. I hold one end of the magazine and she holds the other end. Together, we point and laugh at Ryan's summer pictures from last year. I try to refrain myself from laying my head on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, ladies! That's it! Beautiful!" From what seemed like forever, Ricardo finally needed a drink from talking too much. Not to mention moaning, too. Ew. "Next we will move to the water and do it there. C'mon people, chop chop!"</p>
<p>Oh great, the water. If she's not freaking out about the wig thing, then I shouldn't either. But I can't help it though. "Miley," I whisper quietly as I put on my robe. Its sudden coolness calms me down for a bit. "What if our wigs got wet?"</p>
<p>She waves it off. "No, it won't! We'll just splash around and stuff. Just chillin' in the water. We won't go that deep." I raise an eyebrow. Sometimes she just takes things a bit too far. "Seriously, chill. You're such a worry wart." She hip bumps me and I nudge her arm as I smile.</p>
<p>"Thanks for letting me do this with you. This is the best after break-up experience <i>ever</i>, Miles." I give in a half hug and she gives it back in return. I dunno what it is, but her hugs are just the best I've ever had. I've never felt so safe in my entire life.</p>
<p>"Ok, ladies, we want you guys to change outfits." We turn our heads around and Lucy is holding a clipboard. I glance at her small wrist watch which pointed to four thirty. Man, it seems way longer than that. "We have your outfits inside your tent, Hannah, and both of you will re-do your make-up." As she rambles on about it and walk towards the tent covered tent, Miley tries the sneak her hand to mine. I smile softly and reach for hers and grab it. From the corner of my eye, I see her blush and smile smugly. Does she…?</p>
<p>Nah. Must've been a long day for her. Although it would be a miracle if she did. I should stop thinking like this. It eventually leads to heartbreak.</p>
<p>When we arrive to the tent, we see post-its stick on the swimsuits. Mine is a pink (of course, who doesn't love pink) tankini while Hannah's is a gold monokini that could most definitely show off her slightly toned stomach. Unmistakably, they've made a great choice. We go to the changing rooms and change less than ten minutes, which for me, is a world record. After, we sit on the chairs in front of the portable mirror/make-up desk. Lucifer and his partner help us with the make-up.</p>
<p>"Lola, darling, your eyes are beyond amazing! As bright as the heavenly blue sky! And your skin is flawless! Remarkably tanned and smooth; you, my darling, are an angel from above!" I blush and mutter a thanks. I glance to my left and she gives me a thumbs up.</p>
<p>After putting on foundation and a bunch of other stuff I hardly even use, we head out for the water. It's freezing, but with the blazing sun, it makes it perfect. In the beginning, we just walked around the edge, not fully sure what we were going to do. But, of course, Ricardo always has an idea up in mind.</p>
<p>"Ladies, ladies please. We must do something! I-I do not feel the dynamic between you guys! It is too awkward!" Well, thanks a lot. God, sorry for feeling awkward standing in front of hundreds of people staring at me.</p>
<p>"Hey, I can give her a piggyback ride!" I quickly whip my head to Hannah. I gouge my eyes out. What?</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. That could be good. Yes! That will be fantastic!"</p>
<p>I splash my way towards her and make a huge fuss. Give her a piggyback ride; where the hell did that come from? I mean, not that I don't like it, but really? I shouldn't be worrying about this. It's just for friendly terms, nothing much. Just for a photoshoot. That's all.</p>
<p>"Miley, where the hell did you get that idea? You can't even carry your own suitcase!"</p>
<p>She rolls her eyes. "Lola, I've worked out. You can trust me, I won't drop you." For some reason, I trust her. God, this is so weird.</p>
<p>"Well, I should be carrying you. Of course, I've been playing sports a lot more than you do."</p>
<p>"Well," she copies me, "I'm taller and stronger." She sticks her tongue at me. I stick mine out to hers.</p>
<p>"Ok, Lola, hop on Hannah's back. We will make this quick and harmless. My feet are getting frostbite from this disgusting salt wa-ter."</p>
<p>I'm starting to second guess this as I put my hands on Miley's shoulders. If I do this, god-forbid, I will blame myself for agreeing with her. I jump on her back and yelp unexpectedly.</p>
<p>"Dang, Lola, you're heavier than you look," she groaned. She's tipping back and forth and I clutch her even tighter. "Lola, please loosen up, I can't breathe."</p>
<p>"I can't help it," I snap back. I slap her arm as a punishment for her first remark about me. "And that was rude." I start to adjust myself by putting most of my weight on my thighs so that she could carry me right. I lean my head onto her shoulder and blush when my hands brush by her chest. "H-Hannah, I think this is gonna be a bad idea."</p>
<p>"No, it won't, it'll be fine. This is just the only time I can show you how strong I've gotten," she groaned. I bet her face looks tomato red now.</p>
<p>"I feel horrible now," I whine. I try so hard not to blush in front of the people looking at us. This is definitely <i>not</i> awkward.</p>
<p>"Well, you won't feel horrible when I do this," she starts to say. Then unexpectedly, she jerks forward and my neck stiffens.</p>
<p>"Hannah!" I squeal. She runs through the shallow water and I squirm as I desperately try to cling on to her. My body automatically tightens the grasp around her small body. I feel like I'm suffocating her, but I think she deserves it.</p>
<p>She stops and falls to her knees. "Ok, I guess that was a bad idea," she breathes. I hop of her and all of a sudden, I have the urge to laugh. My throat can't hold it in anymore and I burst out honking. Well, that's very attractive. So to cover up my flaw, I splash her with water, not hitting her face.</p>
<p>"Told'ja you weren't strong enough," I scrunch up my face to her for disapproval. "Hannah, Hannah, Hannah. Looks like we're goin' back to the gy—Hey!"</p>
<p>"Ha ha!" She mocks and I mock her back. Suddenly we're in this splashing cat fight, which I think I'm winning; Hannah's still sitting on her knees. We laugh like a bunch of five year olds and it looks like we're struggling to breathe.</p>
<p>"Wonderful, ladies! Wonderful!" A voice comes out of nowhere. "Ok, that was very, very good! I loved it!" I turn my head to face to see approving nods. "Ok, now the photoshoot is officially over. Everyone can go home now. But only after everyone cleans up!"</p>
<p>Oh crap. I forgot that people were even here. With a camera, no doubt! I stand up straight and head over to Lucy who has our towels and robes. I can't believe I forgot that there were people watching us! I feel so violated now. It's like when Miley and I were goofing off, it felt like we had something. I felt something back there, I'm not going to deny that. And I'm still feeling something right now. The fiery feeling just can't leave my body.</p>
<p>"Hey, you ok?" Well, speak of the devil. "Sorry, didn't mean to surprise you there, but the awkward tension was killin' me and I'm bettin' Ricardo and his group loved it. Hey, you ok? Did you have fun?" she wraps an arm around me.</p>
<p>"Yea, yea, of course." I swallow back my tears and try not to look at her. God, this is so painful. My heart beat is beating so fast now, I'm dying to breathe right. It's like suddenly I want to lay my head on her shoulder. Curse my body. "Sorry, I'm just a bit tired and all."</p>
<p>Her shoulder stiffens as I do lay my head on her shoulder. Probably 'cuz of the weight of my big head. "Perfectly understandable. I felt the same way after my first photoshoot."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh," I yawn. "'Scuse me."</p>
<p>"Hannah, Lola, I want to take a picture with you! Come here to Ricardo!" I shift my head up and she lets go. Ricardo gives his camera to Lucy and motions us to come over to him. I sigh and we walk faster. As we reach Ricardo and his wild scent of vanilla, Lucy took the picture. I think my mouth hurts from smiling too much.</p>
<p>"Thanks Ricky. I hope we get to do this soon again," Hannah says to him. I get my belongings and change. I don't know why, but my body feels just as dead as my brain. I blame the photoshoot. I'll never blame Miley once. Ever. If I did, then I'll just blame myself.</p>
<p>"Alrighty, Miss Lola. Are you ready to go home?" Mr. S scares me from behind. Oh yea, I am pooped. Instead of saying something, I just nod my head and walk over to the limo.</p>
<p>"Bye guys! I love you all! I'll see you next time!" Hannah says to the fans crowding up the car. Once she shuts the door, I open my wig and let it down.</p>
<p>Miley does the same and lays her head on my lap. My legs feel limp now. Thank goodness I'm sitting. "Oy, I am pooped. You sure you had fun, Lils?"</p>
<p>Yawning once again, I nod and lean my head back to the head rest. I can't let her see my face all blushing now, even if she might not be able to see it since it's nearly dark. "Thanks for bringing me with you." Seconds later, I glance down to see why Miley didn't answer. Aw, she's sleeping. So adorable. Ugh, I'm beginning to sound like Ricardo.</p>
<p>Softly, I push her bangs away and my eyelids start to feel heavy. I plop my elbow on the arm rest.</p>
<p>Finally, I can breathe right.</p>
