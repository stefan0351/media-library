<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Thirteen -->

<p>Sam eased her body down into the steaming hot water, letting out a low hiss as it scalded her slightly. She loved that feeling when her skin felt like it was pulling tight and got hot all over. She lowered herself down until the water came up over her shoulders and only her head was dry. Her hair was piled on top of her head to keep it out of the tub as she soaked. She kind of wished Brooke would join her but the blonde hadn?t seemed interested. </p>
<p>&lt;Too bad, I would have loved to have shared this with her&gt; Sam smiled. &lt;And seen that body in a bathing suit up close&gt; She sighed. &lt;Shame on me. I shouldn?t think that way but I can?t help it. Being with her, just the two of us and getting to spend so much time with her is only making my feelings for her stronger. She is so sweet and beautiful. Why am I settling for Nic? Oh yeah, because I can never have Brooke&gt;</p>
<p>"Damn it," Sam swore quietly.</p>
<p>"What?s wrong, Sammy?" Brooke asked as she approached the tub wrapped in a robe. Sam stared at her for a second before recovering.</p>
<p>"Nothing," she bluffed. Brooke nodded and removed her robe revealing a tight red bikini underneath. Sam felt her breath catch at the beauty that was Brooke McQueen.</p>
<p>"Mind if I join you? You looked so relaxed and comfortable that I just couldn?t resist," Brooke said with a wink. Sam was incapable of speaking so she just shook her head as she continued to stare at Brooke. She watched as Brooke lowered herself into the water opposite her.</p>
<p>"God, you?re beautiful," tumbled out of Sam?s mouth before she could stop it. Brooke jumped slightly at the whispered compliment and then blushed.</p>
<p>"Sam?" she started as a small smile crossed her lips. Knowing that Sam thought she was attractive made her very happy.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry, Brooke. I shouldn?t have said that," Sam panicked. She was petrified that Brooke would be offended or think she was coming on to her. Brooke tilted her head.</p>
<p>"Why? Was it a lie?" Brooke asked quietly. Sam picked up her head to look Brooke in the eye and found the blonde watching her intently. She squirmed slightly under the gaze.</p>
<p>"No, it?s the truth," she admitted softly. "I just don?t want you to think the wrong thing."</p>
<p>"Do you think I?m beautiful?" Brooke asked carefully. She didn?t want to spook Sam but she saw an opportunity and wanted to take advantage of it. If she could get Sam to admit that maybe there was something more than friendship between them, she would tell Sam how she felt.</p>
<p>"Yes," Sam whispered.</p>
<p>"Then how can I think the wrong thing?" Brooke said gently while moving closer. Sam had bowed her head again and Brooke wanted to look into those expressive brown eyes as she talked to her. Brooke cupped Sam?s chin in her water hot hand and lifted her face up.</p>
<p>"If that?s how you feel, Sam, then I?m not going to get upset or offended," she explained. "I?m flattered actually. And happy that you feel that way." </p>
<p>"Really?" Sam asked surprised. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Really. And truthfully, Sam, I think you?re beautiful too," she confessed shyly. Taking the chance while she had it, Brooke ran her thumb over Sam?s lush bottom lip and smiled as the corners of Sam?s mouth quirked up.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I?"</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sam?" Brooke said as she leaned closer. Their lips were almost touching, the air still and calm as they leaned towards each other in anticipation.</p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</p>
<p>The front door seemed to wobble with the force of the knocking coming from the other side.</p>
<p>"Ignore it," Sam whispered as her eyes locked with Brooke?s. Brooke nodded silently and leaned back in. She wanted so badly to taste Sam?s lips and could tell that Sam was feeling the same way. Her heart was hammering so loudly in her chest she was surprised Sam couldn?t hear it.</p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</p>
<p>"I know you two are in there! Answer the freaking door!" Nicole?s irate voice cut through the spell surrounding the two like a bucket of cold ice water onto their bodies and they jumped apart.</p>
<p>"Jesus H. Christ," Sam breathed as she tried to will her heartbeat back to normal.</p>
<p>"What the HELL is she doing here?" Brooke fumed. Sam shrugged as the blonde got up, wrapped her robe around her and went to answer the door.</p>
<p>"What the fuck, Nicole?" she said as she ripped open the door to face her former best friend and the rest of the group.</p>
<p>"Surprise," Nicole said smugly as she looked at Brooke. She then saw the lack of attire on the taller girl and frowned. "Where?s Sam?"</p>
<p>"Right here," Sam said as she walked up behind Brooke, tying her robe as she approached. Nicole looked from a dripping wet Brooke to an equally wet Sam and her frown became a hot scowl.</p>
<p>"Isn?t that cute?" she sneered. The rest of the group pushed past the three in the door into the cabin to get out of the cold. They started to inspect the cabin as the three played out their drama in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Why are you here, Nicole?" Brooke asked impatiently. She was so close to getting what she wanted and like always, Nicole had gotten in her way. She was beyond angry.</p>
<p>"I?m surprising my girlfriend," Nicole said, stressing the last word to jab Brooke with it like a barb. She walked over and enveloped Sam in a hug, which Sam returned awkwardly. "Hey," Nicole purred.</p>
<p>"Uh, hi," Sam stammered. She looked over at Brooke, her eyes clearly confused.</p>
<p>"I thought you?d like your birthday present even more if you could share it with me and your friends," Nicole cooed into Sam?s ear explaining herself. Sam forced a smile onto her face. All she really wanted was to get back to the hot tub and Brooke but that wasn?t happening anytime soon. From the crushed and hurt look on Brooke?s face, she doubted it was ever going to happen now anyway.</p>
<p>"Wow, Brooke. This place is really nice," Carmen said as she walked over. Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah whatever. Grab your stuff since I assume you?re staying here. Make yourselves comfortable," she sighed before leaving for her room.</p>
<p>"What?s wrong with Brooke?" Harrison asked. Sam watched the upset blonde leave and wanted to go after her but the tight hold Nicole had on her prevented her from doing so.</p>
<p>"Probably upset that we?re going to be here interrupting her beauty sleep," Nicole said snidely. "She?ll recover. Let?s get settled in."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"All I?m saying, Sam, is that it didn?t look that good when we get here and the two of you are all cozy in the hot tub," Nicole argued later in the room she was sharing with Sam. Sam sighed and flopped down on the bed.</p>
<p>"Whatever, Nicole. Nothing was going on. We skied all day and were simply sharing the tub to soak away the chill. Get over it," Sam retorted.</p>
<p>"You?re my girlfriend, not hers," Nicole pointed out.</p>
<p>"God, Nic, move on all ready. Jealous green is not a good color on you," Sam snapped. Nicole frowned and realized that she was doing more harm than good letting her unruly emotions get in her way. If she continued letting them dictate how she handled Sam, she would lose the brunette to Brooke and it?d be her own fault. She switched tactics.</p>
<p>"Aren?t you at all happy to see me, Sammy?" she said slinking over to the bed and crawling over to Sam. She draped herself over Sam. "I?m happy to see you," she said as she nipped at Sam?s neck and ear.</p>
<p>"Nic, please," Sam sighed. "I?m not in the mood." Nic froze.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I said I wasn?t in the mood. Besides, our friends are in the adjoining rooms. I don?t wanna give them an auditory treat, OK?" Nicole rolled off of her and huffed.</p>
<p>"What has gotten into you lately?" she snapped.</p>
<p>"Me? What about you? Showing up here unannounced. And don?t give me that bullshit about surprising me for my birthday. I know when you?re up to something, Satan," Sam pointed out reverting to Nicole?s nickname out of frustration. Nicole turned on her side to ignore Sam.</p>
<p>"I have no idea what you?re talking about. Good night SPAM," she growled. Neither girl said another word to the other as they drifted off to sleep mad.</p>
