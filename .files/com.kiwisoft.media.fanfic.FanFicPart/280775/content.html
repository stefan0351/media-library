<!-- Human Layers \ Part Five -->

<p>"Will, what am I gonna do?" Buffy asked her friend as they walked
through the quad.</p>

<p>"What do you wanna do?"</p>
<p>The slayer felt it. At least she thought she did. Everything inside her had
been screaming, 'Just Admit It!' When Cordelia had hugged her, showing her
support with the 'Ted' thing in front of everybody, that's when it started. He'd
been a robot, thank God. And a twisted one at that. Parcheesi? Anyway, doubts
became certainties, and she felt giddy. Her. Giddy. It was an odd sensation.
Plus, Buffy thought Cordelia had to be pretty sure too, if she risked that
amount of contact in public. But was she ready?</p>
<p>"I think I'm going to. Tell her."</p>
<i>
<p>'You only live once, right? Well, in my case twice.'</p>
</i>
<p>"Wow..."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Yeah." She thought to herself. "What do you
think?"</p>

<p>"I think 'wow.'" Willow said. "I'll be honest. I'm not used to
being a Cordelia supporter. Hating her with a fiery passion? That I can do. But
I'd have to be a fool, a big fool, if I didn't see that she cares about you. I
don't know her like you do, but she's surprised me. It's still hard to accept a
little, but when the aftermath ensues, I'll be behind you a hundred and ten
percent."</p>
<p>Buffy frowned. "Oh yeah. The aftermath. Does Xander know?"</p>
<p>"No. I'm proud of myself. I pretended I had laryngitis for a week so he
wouldn't make me talk, and then he went back to his usual routine. Ogling girls
that aren't me."</p>
<p>"You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and
smell the hottie."</p>
<p>"I know...but..." Willow trailed off. "So are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am. I'm gonna do it." She was boosting her confidence level
with every step.</p>
<p>"Wow..."</p>
<p>"Speaking of 'wow' potential, there's Oz over there. What are we
thinking, any sparkage?"</p>
<p>Buffy was looking at a guy sitting on the bench, strumming his guitar. He
played with Dingoes Ate My Baby, and Willow had met him during Career Week.</p>
<p>The redhead smiled. "He's nice. I-I like his hands."</p>
<p>"Mm. A fixation on insignificant detail is a definite crush sign. For
me, it's Cordelia's mole."</p>
<p>"Oh! That's a good one!" She got shy again quick. "I don't
know, though. I mean, he is a senior."</p>

<p>"Hey, you're talking to a girl who's about to go 'alternative lifestyle'
and tell the most popular girl in school that she loves her. So I will hear no
excuses. Make a move. Do the talking thing."</p>
<p>"W-what if the talking thing becomes the awkward-silence thing?"</p>
<p>"Well, you won't know until you try."</p>
<p>As Willow walked over, Buffy prepared herself. There would be no turning
back.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>Harmony, Karen, and some other girl whose name she didn't remember, were
cornering Cordelia in the bathroom. She had just spent a weekend in Vegas
watching her parents gamble, and it was really embarrassing. They even had the
nerve to call it 'family time.' A confrontation was low on her list of things
that she wanted to deal with right now.</p>
<p>She knew she had pushed it with the hug, but Buffy had needed it, and she was
caring less and less about other people. But now the questions were coming, and
since a decision hadn't been reached yet, she'd have to think of a lie until
they could talk it over.</p>
<p>"Okay, we're concerned about you, and as your friends we thought it was
necessary to have a...a..." Harmony couldn't think of the word.</p>

<p>"An intervention?" Cordelia supplied.</p>
<p>"See? I told you I knew what it was called!" The blonde snapped at
the other two. "Yeah, so we couldn't help noticing your long guy-less
streak. At first we thought it was just a 'Begging Strike,' but you didn't ask
any of us to join. Then as if that wasn't horrible enough, Jack saw you with
Buffy and Willow in LA, and then he told Josh, who told Tiffany, and then
Tiffany told Amber, then Amber told Karen, and then Karen told me. I didn't
wanna believe it."</p>
<p>"Sounds like you've got a real reliable system there. Might as well have
heard it through the grapevine; at least then you'd have fruit."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Never mind." Why did she want to be popular again?</p>

<p>"We're worried, sweetie. Cause then we saw you...hug her." They all
grimaced. "Spending that much time with losers is obviously unhealthy for
you."</p>
<p>"They're not losers. Well, maybe Xander..."</p>
<p>"They've brainwashed you into defending them? How tragic! Come on,
there's plenty of guys out there! Tell us how we can help. Ooh! We can go to the
health spa across town after school and put this all behind us. My dad knows a
guy, who knows a guy that's having an affair with a girl who works there, so we
got free passes."</p>
<p>"Look, Harmony, it's not as bad as you think..."</p>
<p>"You're in denial, honey." The girl she didn't know, said.</p>
<p>"You poor thing." Harmony added, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No, really. You know I went away with my parents, right?" They
nodded. "Well, I got tired of watching them foam at mouth playing their
slot machines, so I went back up to my room, and I saw this yummy-looking
bellhop." She wanted to gag. "We talked, but we both knew what it was
leading to the whole time."</p>
<p>"You mean...you did it with him?" Harmony asked, in awe.</p>
<p>Cordelia nodded. "He was Mexican, and he quiero me. If it got any
steamier...well, you know. And south of the border? Whew." She fanned
herself.</p>

<p>"Mexican? That's *so* exotic!" As the sheep giggled and a string of
'Oh My God's began, Cordelia had to remember to tell Buffy it was untrue,
because this was going to spread like wildfire. "You have to tell us *all*
the details!"</p>
<p>What Cordelia wasn't aware of, was that Buffy had been listening outside the
door. The slayer already knew, and every word had felt like a blow a million
times worse than any demon had given her. They tore her up inside, and she
wasn't sure if she meant that figuratively or not. She needed air; she hoped
Cordelia wouldn't mind if she didn't stick around for the specifics.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>The next day, Buffy sat in the library in the moping, defeated stage. The
anger and irrationality stage wasn't far away. Leaving school right after she
had heard Cordelia yesterday, she went home and spent all of her unplanned free
time locked in her room, for the initial stage. Where there was heavy sobbing
and crying. After it was over, the shock set in, and every last doubt was
erased. She really did love Cordelia. It wouldn't hurt this much if she didn't.</p>
<p>As much as she was trying not to think it, maybe Willow had been right. Maybe
Cordelia was manipulating her the entire time. She *hated* being manipulated.
Her phone had rung several times the day before, but she didn't answer it on the
chance that it could've been her. She vaguely recalled her mother trying to pry
information out of her, but she hadn't budged. Probably because at the time, she
just hadn't registered her presence.</p>
<p>All those poets might've been right. Love might be a grand, wonderful thing,
but it also sucked when it was turned against you. All you need is love? No,
what Buffy needed was a backup plan and some ice cream.</p>
<p>Giles was coming down the stairs. "Buffy? I didn't hear you come in. How
are you this morning?" His voice wasn't reaching her ears. He walked up to
the table. "Buffy, are you all right?"</p>

<p>"What? Fine. I'm fine." She responded, snapping back into reality.</p>
<p>"Yes..." He didn't think she was, but didn't press it. "Well,
I believe birthday wishes are in order." He smiled.</p>
<p>It was her birthday? Funny how that didn't make her feel better.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Giles." She forced a smile for him.</p>

<p>Willow hurried through the library doors then, attempting to look calm and
casual, but not pulling it off. When she saw her friend's face, she knew she
didn't have to be the one to break it to her, so she relaxed considerably.</p>
<p>"You heard, didn't you?" The redhead asked, sitting down.</p>
<p>"Straight from the horse's mouth." The slayer sighed.</p>
<p>Giles, sensing that this was none of his business, went to catalog.</p>
<p>"You're at name-calling already?"</p>
<p>"It's an expression, Will." She thought for a second. "No,
maybe I am at name calling. You warned me, and I didn't listen. I guess I was
setting myself up for this."</p>

<p>"Maybe there's another explanation." Willow's eyes widened.
"Oh, but did you hear what she...?" Buffy looked at her. Screw other
explanations. "I'm shutting up." Then she remembered something.
"But hey! Sorry, I know I said I was gonna shut up, but this isn't about
that, and I won't bring it up again ever, unless you wanna throw darts at her
head, cause uh, I had her yearbook picture blown up and I take it out and put it
on my door sometimes when I'm really mad at her and...Happy Birthday."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled genuinely this time. Darts?</p>
<p>Now it was Xander's turn to enter, and he came to stand behind Willow's
chair.</p>
<p>"It's the woman of the hour! For she's a jolly good slayer, for she's a
jolly good slayer..." Picking up on the fact that his lame jokes were going
over worse than usual, he stopped. "How about that Cordelia, huh? Gotta
wonder how much room she's got left on that bedpost."</p>

<p>She suddenly felt the need to leave. "Ya know, I have a class that's
starting. Or half over." She got up. "I should probably attend. I'll
catch you guys later."</p>
<p>When she was gone, Xander frowned. "Well, that's not a perky birthday
puppy." Willow slapped his chest. "What was that for?"</p>
<p>"Arm spasm."</p>
<p>"O...kay."</p>
<p>"So much for our surprise party." The hacker said, disappointed.

"I bought little hats and everything."</p>
<p>"Buffy's surprise party will go ahead as we planned. Except I won't be
wearing the little hat." The watcher informed them.</p>
<p>"Giles, I don't think she -"</p>
<p>"Buffy's turning seventeen just this once and she deserves a party. It's
obvious that something is bothering her, but we'll just have to cheer her
up."</p>
<p>"You're a great man of our time." Xander said as he was slapped a
second time. He was suspicious now. "Another one?"</p>
<p>"It comes and goes." The hacker shrugged.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>"Buffy, are you okay?" Angel asked after she had killed the vampire
she'd been fighting.</p>
<p>The group, along with Oz who was Willow's date, and Cordelia, had all come to
the Bronze for her party. They'd been waiting for Miss Calendar to bring her,
when she crashed through the window and went into slay-mode. The redhead wanted
to throw Cordelia out, as she had invited the brunette before she decided to
have sex with someone and break her friend's heart, but she figured she'd let
Buffy do that.</p>
<p>"Yes. W-what happened?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>Buffy gestured behind her. "Uh, there were these vamps outs..." She
glanced around at all the decorations and presents. "W-what's going
on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, um...a surprise party." He said, blowing on a party favor he'd
been holding.</p>
<p>"Happy Birthday." Cordelia said, smiling.</p>
<p>Seeing her, Buffy turned immediately to Angel, flashed him a big smile, and
rubbed a hand along his chest. "You guys did all this for me? That is so
sweet."</p>
<p>"You sure you're okay?" The vampire asked again.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm fine." She looked at Cordelia and was pleased when she
saw that the cheerleader didn't like what she was watching. What a shame.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Willow asked Oz.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Hey, did everybody see that guy just turn to dust?" The
guitarist wondered.</p>
<p>"Uh, well, uh...sort of?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Vampires are real...a lot of them live in Sunnydale...Willow'll
fill you in." Xander sighed and walked off.</p>
<p>"I know it's hard to accept at first..."</p>
<p>"Actually, it explains a *lot*." Oz said.</p>

<p>Cordelia came over to Buffy once the girl had managed to tear herself from
Angel. The slayer knew she couldn't avoid this without making a scene, so she
simply waited.</p>
<p>"Okay, why won't you talk to me? And what was with the show?"</p>
<p>Buffy laughed. "Please tell me you're joking. Like you don't know."</p>
<p>"No, Buffy, I don't know."</p>
<p>She almost believed her. "Why are you even -?"</p>
<p>Miss Calendar came in then, carrying a large, odd-shaped box. "Hey, can
somebody give me a hand here?" Angel and Giles took it from her, setting it
on a table, and Buffy used it as an excuse to walk away from Cordelia.
"Those creeps left this behind."</p>

<p>"What is it?" Buffy questioned.</p>
<p>"I have no idea." Her watcher said, puzzled. "Can-can it be
opened?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. This looks like a release right here."</p>
<p>She got the box open, only to find a severed arm inside. Before she had time
to properly voice her disgust however, it rose up and began choking her. Angel
quickly grabbed onto the arm, and after a few seconds, he was able to wrench it
free from her neck and get it back in the box.</p>
<p>"Well, clearly the Hellmouth's answer to 'What do you get the slayer who
has everything?'" Xander, though frightened, tried to quip.</p>

<p>"Good heavens. Buffy, are you all right?" Giles said, concerned.</p>
<p>Though she didn't want to, Cordelia stood in the background, showing silent
concern. She didn't feel all that welcome.</p>
<p>Buffy coughed. "Man, that thing had major grip."</p>
<p>"W-what was that?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"It looked like an arm." Oz stated the obvious.</p>

<p>"It can't be. She wouldn't." Angel shook his head in disbelief.</p>
<p>"What, vamps version of 'Snakes in a Can', or do you care to
share?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"It-it's a legend...way before my time...of a demon brought forth to rid
the Earth of the plague of humanity...separate the righteous from the
wicked...and to burn the righteous down. They call him the Judge."</p>
<p>"The Judge? This is he?" Giles questioned.</p>
<p>"Not all of him."</p>
<p>Buffy raised her hand. "Um, still needing backstory here?"</p>

<p>"Um...he, he-he couldn't be killed, yes? Um, a-an army was sent against
him. Most of them died...but, uh, finally they were able to dismember him, but,
uh...not kill him." The Englishman explained.</p>
<p>"The pieces were scattered...buried in every corner of the Earth."
Angel continued.</p>
<p>"So all these parts are being brought here." Miss Calendar
realized.</p>
<p>"By Drusilla. The vamps outside were Spike's men." Buffy told
everyone.</p>
<p>"She's just crazy enough to do it." Angel knew his childe well.</p>

<p>"Do what, reassemble the Judge?" Willow was confused.</p>
<p>"And bring forth Armageddon."</p>
<p>A plan was formulated. By Miss Calendar of all people. Angel was going to get
on a cargo ship, and try to take the box as far away from Sunnydale as possible,
tonight. She volunteered to drive him to the docks, and Buffy said she would go
along. She wanted to say goodbye, because no one knew when he'd be back, but
this was also a great opportunity for her to get back at Cordelia. She couldn't
pass it up.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>Buffy followed Angel into his apartment later that night, her arms wrapped
around herself. She was shivering from the rain they had just run through.
Everything had been going off without a hitch; they'd gone to the docks and
Angel was going to get onto the boat, but they were ambushed by more of Spike's
men, and the box was stolen. While that was happening, she had ended up in the
water somehow, and Angel dove in after her.</p>
<p>Miss Calendar had dropped them off at the library, and then went home,
frustrated with something. Everyone was researching, hoping to find a way to
stop the Judge, but all the books called him un-killable. Cordelia was up in the
stacks when they had gotten there, and stayed out of sight the entire time.
Angel eventually remembered that one of his contacts had recently informed him
that there were a lot of vampires that liked to hang around the old factory the
Anointed One had used.</p>
<p>She decided that she and Angel would scope out the factory and the Judge. She
had briefly considered going over to Cordelia before leaving, but she was firmly
in the anger stage and that impulse faded fast. It was nice being able to avoid
her emotions. They got to the factory, and discovered that Druscilla was having
a birthday party of her own. Also, the Judge was assembled. Nearly having the
humanity burned out of them, they barely managed to escape and run here, through
the storm.</p>
<p>"You're shaking like a leaf." Angel noticed.</p>

<p>"Cold." She told him, her teeth chattering.</p>
<p>"Let me get you something."</p>
<p>As she watched him get her clothes from his armoire, the only thing she could
think was,</p>
<i>
<p>'Angel would never sleep with a bellhop.'</p>
</i>
<p>There was something wrong with that thought, though.</p>
<p>"Put these on. Get under the covers, just to warm up." He said to
her, and she went to his bed and sat. When he didn't turn away, she stared at
him until he got the message. "Sorry." Taking off her top shirt, she
winced. "What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, um...it's okay. I just have...a cut or something." She assured
him.</p>
<p>Was it her imagination or was it warming up in here?</p>
<p>"Can I...?" He started, but then trailed off, hesitant. "Let
me see."</p>
<p>Buffy held her shirt to her chest. "Okay."</p>
<p>Angel turned, facing her, and sat down on the bed. He touched her back
softly, inspecting the cut. Uh oh. This was dangerous territory. Her body was
conflicting with her brain, but if she did allow something to happen, would she
really be in the wrong? Cordelia slept with someone, why couldn't she? That was
her rationale. They'd be even, right? No harm, no foul, and it wasn't like Angel
wasn't attractive. She did care for him, so...</p>
<p>But she didn't love him, and she'd be using him to get back at Cordelia. She
couldn't do that to him, could she?</p>

<p>"It's already closed. You're fine." Buffy leaned back into him, and
brought their faces together as he put his arms around her. "I..."</p>
<p>He felt good. Very good.</p>
<p>"You what?" She asked him softly.</p>
<p>It was so tempting. To make her hurt like she was hurting. Would Cordelia
even be affected? Angel would be caught in the middle, and...</p>
<p>"I love you. I try not to, but I can't stop." He said it with such
meaning, such emotion, and she was hit with it.</p>

<p>They began kissing feverishly. This was the irrationality stage; she was
supposed to be irrational. But...damn, did he say he loved her? Why did he have
to say that? This wasn't her. She was better than Cordelia. She wasn't the kind
of person who could just...she pulled back abruptly, thus ending the
irrationality stage. Just in time, too. Before she made a mistake, and did
something she probably would've regretted.</p>
<p>"I can't. It wouldn't...I'm sorry. I don't wanna hurt you."</p>
<p>Angel stood up, putting distance between them as he tried to calm himself
down. In more ways than one.</p>
<p>"Because you don't."</p>
<p>"There's somebody else."</p>
<p>"Cordelia." He said, and Buffy slipped on the dry sweater he'd
given her.</p>
<p>"How'd -?"</p>
<p>"Willow told me at the party. Before you got there. She was upset, and
talked...*really* fast, but I think I got the general idea."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled. "Then why'd you let me kiss you?"</p>
<p>"For a second, I wanted to believe something I knew wasn't true."
Angel smiled sadly. "If you love her, then don't give up on her until
you've heard what she has to say."</p>
<p>And here began the facing the music, good or bad, stage.</p>
<p>"I know it's not the same, and I know this'll sound like a line...but
could we possibly be friends?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't mind." He said, almost gratefully. Though the
likelihood of finding someone like Buffy again, someone to love, was low. But he
masked his sadness. Buffy deserved to be happy, and as the Slayer, she needed it
more than he did. He'd always support that. "You should stay here until the
storm blows over. And then -"</p>

<p>"And then I'll go talk to her." She finished for him.
"So...wanna play Go Fish?"</p>
