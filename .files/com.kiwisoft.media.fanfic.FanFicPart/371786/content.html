<P><B>aqui esta su capitulo doce! (here is your chapter 12)! :) now this chapter will probably seem a whole lot faster than my others, so i apologize for that. a lot of you might hate me or flame me or whatever. but ya know what? it's my story and i can do what i want! so there! :P mwahahahahaha!...</B></P><P><B>tehe :)</B></P><P>I have never felt so...light. That night, Daddy and I just sat on my bed discussing everything that we'd both been too weak and afraid to discuss. I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I didn't have to carry that constant guilt and secret around anymore. My dad, (along with my psychiatrist every Saturday morning for the past 6 weeks), had helped me to see that what happened to Jackson, it wasn't my fault. It wasn't anyone's fault. Even Dad, even though he could've just opened his eyes and ears, I couldn't blame him forever. I couldn't hold that against him forever. No amount of anger or resentment was going to bring Jackson or Momma back, and Dr. Clarik had helped me to see that.</P><P>Lilly and I, we still weren't anything but friends and almost step-sisters. Don't get me wrong, she was there for me through all six weeks of therapy and medication. Oh, yeah, did I mention that? I'm on happy pills. Daddy says it's only temporary, just until he knows I won't go off again. Although, how would he know if my moods now are fake? Falsely induced? I'll always seem fine on them. Anyway, Lilly's been really great; moral support and what have you. I gotta say, the thought of being connected to her, whether it's through our parents' marriage, our friendship trio, or romantic ties, it's not seeming bad at all anymore. In fact, I may actually be falling for her...cruel and teasing antics to try to get me to do my homework. Take tonight, for example.</P><P>"Hey, Miley, have you done Mr. Carelli's homework yet?" Lilly asked me from across the room where she was working at the desk.</P><P>I lifted my body to a seated position on the bed and stared at her. "Hey, Lilly, has hell frozen over yet?"</P><P>And there it was, that devilish smirk as she slowly rose from the chair and slinked her way over to me. "You are an evil little girl."</P><P>She nodded seductively, crawling towards me on the bed. Upon reaching where I was, that sexy blonde straddled me and gently pushed my hair behind my shoulder, then began to kiss my neck. Damn her. I couldn't help myself (I never can when she does this to me). My head lolled back and a moan of pleasure escaped my lips. And just like she always does, she pulled back.</P><P>"So, Miley, are you gonna do Mr. Carelli's homework?" I gazed back at her, my desire for her hazing over my eyes and consuming my thoughts. She smiled, knowing I'd once again been defeated. "I take that as a yes. So, I'm just going to go back over to the desk now and finish my Pre-cal homework. You get started on that Government worksheet. He gave us the whole weekend to do it and it's due tomorrow." She climbed back off the bed, now finished with being sexy and seductive, and clambered her way back over to the desk.</P><P>"Yeah, yeah. You are cruel."</P><P>She swiveled the chair and looked at me with shocked eyes. Fake shocked eyes. "Who? Me? Why, Miley, I can't believe you would say such a thing! If you wouldn't procrastinate, we wouldn't be having this issue."</P><P>"Well, if you wouldn't tell me you were going to the beach, I wouldn't feel compelled to follow you to watch you jump around playing beach volleyball."</P><P>A small mischevous small escaped before she could catch it. "Yes, well, it's not my fault that you can't control your sexual thoughts and desires."</P><P>"They wouldn't be so hard to control if you'd stop doing things like what you just did to me. Or if you finally gave in..."</P><P>The smile was gone, all traces of our joking mood wiped away. "Miley, you know I can't. Stop bringing it up."</P><P>"Can't, or won't? What you can't do is tease me like this every time you want me to do something, then push me away again and refuse to have anything sexual or romantic to do with me. It's not fair and you know it."</P><P>Lilly sighed, knowing I was right, and spun the chair back around to face her work. There was no rebuttal, no defensive response, no denial. She knew what she was doing was wrong, and she couldn't deny it when I called her on it. If she can call me on my shit, I can call her on hers. <I>That's </I>what's fair.</P><P>"Maybe...," her voice trailed off and she shook her head, not finishing the thought.</P><P>I was outraged. "No, you know I hate that! You can't do that! Finish what you were going to say."</P><P>"No, it's stupid. I don't want to tell you."</P><P>"If you didn't want to tell me you wouldn't have started to say it out loud in the first place. Spill."</P><P>A long pause of hesitation and a minute later, she answered. "Maybe we could try."</P><P>I thought I knew what she meant, but I wanted to double check. "Maybe we could try...what?"</P><P>"Maybe we could try it out, the relationship thing. Perhaps we could give it a shot."</P><P>"Are...Are you serious!" I was way too excited to have her let me down. This better not be another trick.</P><P>"Yeah. I mean, Miley," she swirled the chair back around to face me, "I've liked you for, like, what, two years?"</P><P>My jaw dropped. "Two years? Are you shitting me? Lilly, I've only known you for about three months!"</P><P>"But I've known you for a lot longer. I noticed you the day I moved here, two years ago. The mysterious rebel chick always dressing in black and breaking the rules and pissing off whoever she pleased. You intrigued me. From the first time I saw you, I thought, 'Something happened to her. Her attitude screams I don't care, but her eyes plead Help me. And I wanted to. I wanted to be the one to save you." No. Fucking. Way. I didn't say anything, just stared at her with an apalled expression. She continued anyway, thinking that I wanted to hear more. "And now I know; now I know what's been eating away at you for all these years. You've been carrying this tremendous burden on you for half your life." She crossed the room again and plopped down so close beside me our legs were touching. "I'm so glad I could be one of the people who helped you get rid of that."</P><P>Lilly lifted her right hand to tuck my hair behind my ear. I covered her hand with my own, and turned my head to kiss her palm. My lips lingered on her skin before I turned my head back to where her palm rested on my cheek. "So...we're gonna try it?"</P><P>Her smile was response enough for me, but she said, "Yeah, we're gonna try it."</P><P>I squealed, (yeah, I actually squealed), and jumped off the bed, too excited to stay stationary. Then, I stopped. "Wait, if we're gonna do this, I wanna do it right."</P><P>She looked at me quizzically until I walked around the bed to her side and dropped down to one knee before her. I took her hand in both of mine, smiling up at her. "Lilly, will you be my girlfriend?"</P><P>A grin spread across her face, awakening all these sensations inside me I'd never felt before. "Yes." Then, her smile spread wider, if that was possible. "Yes, of course!"</P><P>I hopped up and grabbed her face in my hands, kissing her with all my heart. All the passion and caring and...and...love I felt for her, I put in that kiss. I think she felt it, too, and I think the feeling was mutual. She pulled away, giggling. "Miley, I've never in my life seen you this happy."</P><P>"Yeah, it's those happy pills they put me on."</P><P>"No," she smiled, "I don't think it's the drugs."</P><P>I thought about it, then smiled back. "You're right. It's not." I paused. "It's you."</P><P>...</P><P>"Ready?"</P><P>"Yeah."</P><P>"Truth or Double Truth?"</P><P>Lilly mulled over her choices, then announced, "Double truth."</P><P>It was Monday night, and Lilly and I had decided that to get to know each other better, we'd play a game called Truth or Double Truth. If you picked truth, you just had to answer one straight up question, like "What's your favourite animal?" But, if you picked double truth, you had to answer a question like this: "What is your favourite animal, <I>and why?" </I>We were at the beach, watching the waves and admiring the moonlit sky. We'd both kicked off our flip-flops and dug our feet in the sand like we used to when we were kids.</P><P>So far, all the questions had been surface questions: favourite colour, food, music, book. I wanted to dig deeper, though. These were not the questions that would form a relationship. So, I picked a hard one. "Who is Melissa London to you?"</P><P>She looked over at me, startled by the sudden change in question difficulty. "What do you mean?"</P><P>"You told me all these things you know about her when you were dying my hair. I wanna know how you know all those things."</P><P>The blonde girl on my right turned her attention back to the waves. "Where's the double truth in that?"</P><P>"Okay, fine. Who is Melissa London to you, and why haven't you told me?"</P><P>There was a hesitant pause before she answered. "Melissa and I used to date. She's really cool, actually. You'd know that if you ever gave her the time of day. Her home life, though. It's not as picture perfect as it looks. Sure, her dad's flithy rich with his trophy wife and two kids, one of each. It all looks perfect, but it's not. Her dad...he used to beat them: Melissa, her mom, her brother. He was an alcoholic, too, and he cheated on Melissa's mom constantly. He'd come home totally smashed, some slut's perfume all over him. Whenever her mom would ask him about where he was or who he was sleeping with, he'd take a swing at her. Of course, Melissa and Mark, her brother, they weren't just gonna stand there and watch their dad beat on their mom. So, then they'd try to defend her and get themselves hurt in the process."</P><P>She stopped again, and I thought the story was over, until she continued and I realized that it wasn't. "One night, I was at home watching <I>16 and Pregnant </I>with my mom, listening to her lecture me about teen pregnancy, when our doorbell rang. I went to answer it and there stood Melissa, black eye and busted lip, kind of hunched over holding onto her stomache. Of course, I ushered her in, sat her on the couch, and asked my mom to go get me a warm, wet rag and glass of water. She told me everything, all the background info. Then she told me how her father had come home that night more hammered than she'd ever seen him. Her mother, in a fit of bravery, had decided she wasn't gonna take it anymore and told him to get out. Well, as you can probably guess, that didn't go so well."</P><P>"Oh, my god."</P><P>"Yeah. Anyway, we called the police for her, and they came to my house, asked us all kinds of questions, and sent a cop car and an ambulance over to Melissa's house to go handle the situation there. Her father's in prison serving for domestic violence. And I haven't told you, because she asked me, well begged me really, not to tell anyone. This was her family's business and no one else's. When she told me she loved me, I realized that I didn't share the same sentiment, so we broke it off."</P><P>"Hence the stink eye she gave me that day."</P><P>Her tone turned to confused and she turned to stare at me. "What?"</P><P>Shit. Now I'd have to tell her how I was watching her. "Well, I was bored one day so I walked around and I just happened to come across the hall that your class was in...Okay, maybe I went there intentionally. I started watching you, let me tell ya, you are one mesmerizing chick, and Melissa totally stared at me like I was the devil incarnate. Jealousy was oozing from her body."</P><P>Lilly chuckled, picking up a rock that lay beside her and skipping it across the water with the flick of her wrist. I, of course, was amazed. "Hey, how'd you do that?"</P><P>Her smile lit up my world. "A magician never reveals her secrets. Alright, your turn. Truth or double truth?"</P><P>"Hmm...truth, just to be different."</P><P>"Okay...why were you staring at me that day?"</P><P>I gently brushed my bangs out of her face before answering. "Because even before I knew it, I was falling for you."</P><P>That magical smile of hers warmed my heart and soul. "Miley Stewart, you can't possibly be implying that love is entering the mix, after a mere two days of dating and three months of comradery."</P><P>I thought about it. "I think I am."</P><P>"Then, good. I'm glad I wasn't the one who had to say it first."</P><P>"Say what?"</P><P>"That I love you."</P><P>Amusement flooded my features. "Ha. You said it first."</P><P>She looked like she was about to refuse that when she stopped and realized that it was true. "Drat."</P><P>"Hey, Lilly, guess what?"</P><P>"What?" she asked, all pouty.</P><P>"I love you, too."</P><P>We both smiled like giddy fools and leaned in for a kiss, our lips meeting halfway, much like we had done since she'd entered my life.</P><P>...</P><P>After that night, the months flew by. It's amazing how love and speed and slow time at once. I actually started going to classes and doing my homework and participating. Teachers, of course, were shocked at first. But after a while, they got used to it; well, sort of. Everytime I raise my hand or turn in an assignment, the teacher's face lights up with excitement. Turns out, now I'll actually get to graduate in a couple months, alongside Lilly and Oliver. Oh, by the way, Oliver's football hottie Robbiepoo refused to come out, so he dropped the sucker. Now he's got his eye on a cute, out and proud hunk in student council, whose name, incidentally, is Harvey. Yes, folks, an out and proud political officer in our school named Harvey. Sound familiar?</P><P>Anyway, today is Dad and Heather's wedding day. Yes, you remembered correctly, that also means it's Valentine's Day. I've got a special surprise in store for Lilly, but it's later, at the reception. Oh, and in case you're wondering, the answer is yes. I did come out to my dad. In one of those therapy sessions Dr. Clarik said that we should get everything out in the open, that it would help us to be a better, unbroken family. So I told him. I told him about just me at first, then I added Lilly to the mix. I explained to him how she made me feel like no one has ever made me feel. I told him how she'd awakened all these new sensations inside of me that no guy ever could. And I told him how much I love her. I thought he might explode or shatter all the progress we'd made together, because I know how homophobic he is, I remember how he treated Lilly that day, how he referred to gay people. But he was calm. He tried to understand and listen to everything I had to say. Plus, he convinced Heather to do the same. We may not be the picture perfect family, but we were trying. We were trying.</P><P>The ceremony went by fast. All the lovey-dovey stuff that, what seemed like ages ago, would've made me puke, it actually kind of moved me. From where Lilly was standing as maid-of-honor and I was standing as a bridesmaid, I took her hand and squeezed it tight. She turned her face to smile at me quickly before returning her gaze to where her mother and my father stood, sealing the deal on their relationship. They recited their vows and said their I Do's and exchanged their rings and their ceremonial man-and-wife kiss. Then it was off to the reception, where the real fun would begin.</P><P>...</P><P>Lilly and I were on the dance floor, swirling and twirling each other around to some sappy slow song. I think it was by Celine Dion. Anyway, Lilly looked at me with those beautiful, bright eyes and loving smile and I melted. "Have I told you lately that I love you?"</P><P>"I hate everything about you, why do I love you?"</P><P>I swatted her arm and stared shocked at her. "Hey, that wasn't a nice one!"</P><P>"I know, but I'm running out of love songs just off the top of my head. It still counts, it still says I love you."</P><P>That's been our new game, Lilly and I. One of us will randomly tell the other a lyric from a love song that has the words "I love you" in it, our way of saying it to each other.</P><P>"Okay, fine. I've got one," she declared.</P><P>"Go ahead."</P><P>"If we were a movie, you'd be the right girl, and I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with in the end."</P><P>Confusion consumed me. "Is that even a real song?"</P><P>"Nah, I wrote it the other night." That was another thing I'd discovered about Lilly over the months. She wrote music. She refused to sing it, though. She's not much of a singer.</P><P>"I like it. It didn't have the words I love you, though, so it doesn't work for our game. But I'll let it slide since it was so good and you're so cute and I love you so much."</P><P>"Oh, you're so generous."</P><P>"I know. It's the whole new me." The new me that's been off of Prozac now for 4 months, thank you very much. Right after Lilly and I said we loved each other, my dad noticed that I was practically vomiting sunshine and agreed to take me off.</P><P>A new song played, but it was a song I recognized. "Hey," I told Lilly, unwrapping her arms from around me, "I gotta go real quick. I'll be right back, 'kay?"</P><P>She looked hurt. "Wait, where are you going?"</P><P>"Just stay there, please. I'll be back. Wait for me."</P><P>"O-...Okay. Yeah. I'll be right here."</P><P>"Good, don't move a muscle."</P><P>I scampered off and walked around the side of the dance floor, catching gazes with Daddy and brushing my nose with my finger, the signal. He nodded, his acknowledgement. He and Heather might not fully accept Lilly and I yet, but they were willing to let me do just one thing for her at our wedding. As much as they're against gay people, they're romantics.</P><P>I climbed up the steps of the outdoor stage they'd had built for their reception on the beach and stood to the side, hidden, waiting. I watched Lilly look around helplessly, feeling alone and deserted. If I wasn't about to do what I was about to do, I definitely would've died inside seeing her like that. But then the song ended, and I knew her whole mood was about to change. I crossed the stage and stood at the mic, while the regular singer went and took a break, sitting on the stage steps.</P><P>"Hey, y'all," I said into the mic, earning everyone's attention. Lilly's head whipped around to look at the stage, and she gawked at me, like she thought I'd gone back to my rebel ways and I was about to ruin the whole evening. "I just wanna dedicate this song to a very special person tonight. I'm sure you all know that my daddy just married that wonderful woman in his arms. They've both so graciously allowed me to sing this one song, and it goes like this."</P><P><I>Beauty queen of only eighteen</I></P><P><I>She had some trouble with herself</I></P><P><I>He was always there to help her</I></P><P><I>She always belonged to someone else</I></P><P>Lilly and I always considered this our song. The day that Lilly helped dye my hair was the day, I now realized, all this friend and more than friend stuff was set into motion. And this song had started to play on the radio. Then, on my eighteenth birthday in November, Lilly set up a little candlelit dinner for me at our house and she put this song as the first track on a mixed CD she'd made me of all the songs that reminded her of me. We played it in the background all night long. And now, I was singing it to her, on our four month anniversary.</P><P><I>I don't mind spending every day</I></P><P><I>Out on your corner in the pouring rain</I></P><P><I>Look for the girl with the broken smile</I></P><P><I>Ask her if she wants to stay a while</I></P><P><I>And she will be loved</I></P><P><I>She will be loved</I></P><P>Her face, the whole time I was singing to her, was like a kid who just got told every wish they made for the rest of their life would be granted. She literally looked like I'd just made her existence.</P><P>The song was soon over, and the crowd clapped for me as I stepped down off the stage and headed towards my girlfriend. She engulfed me in the tightest embrace I've ever known. "Thank you," she whispered into my ear.</P><P>"Anything for you, Lilly," I replied, my head resting on her shoulder. "You helped me when no one else could. You saved me when I didn't want to be saved. You pulled me out of the quick sand my life had become, Lilly. Thank you."</P><P>She pulled back and smiled at me. "I love you."</P><P>"I love you, too."</P><P>We started dancing again and she continued smiling. "You were pretty good up there, ya know. You could make a career out of that."</P><P>I laughed. "What, singing? No, that was a one time deal. Just for you."</P><P>"No, I'm serious. I could write the songs and you could sing them. We'd be famous."</P><P>"You know, I don't really wanna deal with all the paparazzi and stuff. Fame sounds hard. Never being able to even walk out your door to go buy a carton of milk from the grocery store without having twenty cameras shoved in your face? It doesn't sound like much fun to me."</P><P>"Okay, then you could get a disguise. Yeah, pull a Clark Kent and do something like throw a wig on. You could use a stage name, too. Come on, you gotta admit, it sounds awesome."</P><P>"Well," I conceded, "I've always wondered what I look like as a blonde."</P><P><B>ta-da! end of story! what do you think? yeah, it was sudden and thrown in your face. i'm sorry! please don't gather an angry mob with torches and pitchforks! it just felt like time. besides, you guys were probably fed up with my slow updates anyway! so, review, tell me what you honestly thought, please! just no flames. constructive criticism, yes. harsh criticism that does nothing to help my skills as a writer, no.</B></P><P><B>epilogue? sequel? i can't guarantee either of these but you can request them at your leisure. but you gotta review to do that! ha! :P</B></P>
