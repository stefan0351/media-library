<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 10 -->

<p>Nicole began to pace again, shaking her head, throwing her arms in the air.</p>
		<p>"It all makes sense now. Everything! You've been acting like a jealous freak ever since he got here and I thought it was because you wanted him. But I was only half right".</p>
		<p>She paused and stopped.</p>
		<p>"You're jealous of him, because you want her".</p>
		<p>Brooke inwardly sighed. First Josh, now Nicole. It seemed she wasn't hiding her feelings as well as she thought she was.</p>
		<p><i>Is it written on my forehead?! </i></p>
		<p>Her immediate thought was to deny everything. All she had to do was laugh at Nicole's accusation and question whether too much hair dye was seeping into her brain.  </p>
		<p>Brooke was quite the actress when the situation required it.</p>
		<p>Nicole was her best friend but it didn't mean that Brooke trusted her. Not by any stretch of the imagination. She made no secret of the fact that she was willing to do anything to stay at the top, and if it meant screwing Brooke over, she'd do that too.</p>
		<p>With a smile.</p>
		<p>"Brooke? For the love of god, tell me it isn't true!" Nicole interrupted, her voice rising.</p>
		<p>Brooke made no effort to respond. </p>
		<p>Nicole continued. "If you're intention is to give me a heart attack, then you are doing a fucking good job of it!" </p>
		<p>Brooke looked up and glared. No matter what the problem was, Nicole always managed to twist it around so it became all about her.</p>
		<p><i>Fuck this.</i></p>
		<p>"Nic, do you honestly think I want Sam?" Brooke finally asked.</p>
		<p>Nicole hesistated, a little confused at Brooke's calm demeanor.</p>
		<p>"Yeah." She paused. "I'm right, aren't I?"</p>
		<p>"No. You're not", Brooke replied.</p>
		<p>Nicole watched her for a moment, trying to detect any signs that Brooke was lying to her. Satisfied, she grinned, sitting down as relief flooding through her body. </p>
		<p>"Damn, Brooke. You scared the shit out of me!"</p>
		<p>Brooke continued. "In fact, I am head over heels in love with her".</p>
		<p>It took all but a millisecond before Nicole exploded. She stood up, arms flailing, her voice rising in volume. </p>
		<p>"WHAT?! Love?! Did you say love?! You love Spam?! What the hell is wrong with you?! For fucks sake! It was the Xena tapes wasn't it?! It made you gay! I can't believe this!".</p>
		<p>Nicole showed no signs of stopping.</p>
		<p>"Was Josh that bad?! To put you off men for life?! I'll kill him! I'll find him and kick his puny quarterback ass!" </p>
		<p>Nicole continued to rant, and Brooke wondered if the people of Australia could hear her. It also entered her head that Nicole would have had no problems curing Third World debt if she were fined ten cents for every swear word spoken in the past five minutes.</p>
		<p>After what seemed like forever, Nicole stopped and glanced at Brooke who simply stared back.</p>
		<p>It was Brooke who finally broke the silence.</p>
		<p>"Nic, if you even consider saying "But you're a cheerleader", I will break your head".</p>
		<p>Nicole leaned back against the wall, confused. "I don't understand you".</p>
		<p>"What's not to understand? It's pretty simple really. I'm in love with Sam". </p>
		<p>Nicole cringed. </p>
		<p>"Please try and refrain from saying that around me and that is not what I meant." </p>
		<p>She paused. "Why did you admit it? You know I could have a field day with this".</p>
		<p>Brooke shrugged. "You asked, I answered. I'm not going to deny it anymore".</p>
		<p>"And you trust me with this information?" Nicole asked, surprised.</p>
		<p>"To be honest, no I don't. But I'm hoping you prove me wrong anyway". Brooke replied.</p>
		<p>Nicole stared at her, ignoring the slight twinge of hurt at Brooke's admission. </p>
		<p>"You are willing to risk everything, because you l..lo...", Nicole choked on the words, "l-love Spam?"</p>
		<p>Brooke laughed bitterly.</p>
		<p>"I don't have everything Nic! The one thing I want, the ONLY thing I want, I don't have! And I'll trade my so called "everything" to be with her. I'd do it without a second thought".</p>
		<p>Nicole stared at Brooke in amazement, trying hard not to be moved by the emotion in Brooke's voice. She pushed it aside though, intent on capitalizing on this opportunity.</p>
		<p>"So, if you really don't care, then I guess you won't mind me speading the word about your new found, joyful emotions then?" Nicole asked, crossing her arms.</p>
		<p>Brooke looked down and shook her head. She truly hoped that it wouldn't come to this. She stood up and walked over to Nicole, her face hard, her voice like ice.</p>
		<p>"Go ahead Nic. Do the best damage you can. You want my place? Take it. I'm betting you won't last more than a month".</p>
		<p>Nicole glared. "Is that so?"</p>
		<p>"They fear you. They might even respect you but the thing is, they don't like you. You treat people like dirt and it'll only be so long before they won't take it anymore. History shows that the natives get restless when they don't like their leader".</p>
		<p>Brooke stopped, softening her voice.</p>
		<p>"You are my best friend Nic and I love you, despite your huge flaws as friendship material. I took a risk by telling you this and believe me when I say that losing your friendship is the last thing I want to happen. I want you in my life."</p>
		<p>She paused.</p>
		<p>"The fact is, I'm in love with Sam and that's not going to change any time soon. If ever.  Chances are nothing will come of it but that's not the point here. I want to know that I can trust you. With anything".</p>
		<p>She looked away, her voice breaking a little.</p>
		<p>"I may not have Sam in my life the way I want her to be, but from now on, I'm going to make every attempt to be her friend. The best friend I can be. I need her in my life, any way that I can get it."</p>
		<p>She turned back to Nicole.</p>
		<p>"Don't make me choose between the two of you because I'm telling you now".</p>
		<p>She stepped closer.</p>
		<p>"You will lose EVERY. SINGLE. TIME".</p>
		<p>And with that, Brooke walked out.</p>
