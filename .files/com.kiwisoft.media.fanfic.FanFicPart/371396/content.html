<p>Author's note: Finally throwing another chapter out there for ya. Every review is appreciated and stacked on my mental trophy shelf :)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Who reads this crap, anyway?</p>
<p><hr size=1 noshade>Viola blinked in surprise at Duke's unexpected proposal.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked, not sure if she understood what Duke had just told her. The soccer captain looked down at his clenched fists resting on his knees.</p>
<p>"I said to stop dating Olivia." he stated again, not looking his roommate in the eyes. Viola was confused by this.</p>
<p>"Why?" she asked. In her mind, the whole 'going out with the hottest girl in school' shouldn't be an issue so big that Duke would have to approach her about it. Duke sighed before answering.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm just looking out for Olivia. Last night with all those girls approaching you, and then you coming out of her room this morning... You're obviously a player who uses women. I just don't want to see Olivia get hurt." Duke finished with a pleading look in Viola/Sebastian's direction. Viola couldn't help but think, <i>Aww, he's such a gentleman. How cute!</i></p>
<p>"So what? You want me to break up with her so you can date her or something?" Viola asked suspiciously. Duke appeared flustered by the suggestion and looked away in embarrassment again.</p>
<p>"Well... Maybe." he said as if defending the idea that the world really was flat.</p>
<p>"Dude, she had that option for like, three years." Viola said with a roll of her eyes. She should have seen the obvious ulterior motive. Duke might as well have said 'Stay away from Olivia so that I may rescue her endangered purity and rob it for myself!'</p>
<p>"Are you going to take the deal or not?" Duke exclaimed in frustration. Viola paused to think for a second. Her whole goal here was to join the soccer team to beat Cornwall. If Duke was willing to help her achieve that, then she was sure Olivia would understand. It wasn't as if they were actually dating anyway.</p>
<p>"Alright, you got yourself a deal!" Viola agreed, a smile brightening her features. Duke smiled back in relief and held his fist out.</p>
<p>"You the man."</p>
<p>"Yes I am." Viola responded as she bumped fists with her new soccer tutor. Seemed like everything would turn out good for her and her plan. So why the heck was she feeling so guilty?</p>
<p>Olivia was just placing her extra books into her locker when she spotted Viola/Sebastian running towards, looking for all she was worth ecstatic beyond belief. She skidded breathlessly to halt next to Olivia's locker.</p>
<p>"Liv, I got great news for you!" Viola exclaimed in excitement. Her happiness was contagious and Olivia found herself grinning back.</p>
<p>"Whats got you bouncing off the walls, Sebastian?" Olivia asked, careful to call Viola by her 'alias' while in public.</p>
<p>"Well, after class Duke and I got to talking. And he said he would help me with my soccer. If I get good enough I can be a first-stringer by the Cornwall game! It isn't it great!" Viola exclaimed, keeping her voice in character the entire time despite her demeanor leaking sunshine upon anything she touched. And right now it was Olivia she was touching since she suddenly enveloped the blond girl in a tight embrace.</p>
<p>Olivia gasped in surprise when Viola suddenly grabbed her and pulled her into a hug. It seemed she would never get used to the other girl's tendency to show affection when in a good mood. Just as she was hesitantly raising her own arms to hug her pretend-boyfriend back (When would another opportunity to feel Viola up a bit arise again? She had to take advantage of the situation!), Viola suddenly separated herself from Olivia (bummer) but kept a firm grasp on her shoulders while looking her in the eye.</p>
<p>"Oh! I almost forgot!" Viola exclaimed, suddenly looking nervous. Olivia raised an eyebrow at Viola's suddenly fidgeting body.</p>
<p>"Whats wrong?" she asked in concern as well as suspicion. She had a feeling it involved her in a way she wouldn't like.</p>
<p>"Well, you see, he had this... uh, deal thing going on... something about if I wanted his help then I shouldn't... how do I put this?... I shouldn't go out with you anymore..." Viola's sentence became progressively less excited with every word and she ended up trailing away once she was relatively finished. Olivia felt something cracking inside of her a little bit.</p>
<p>"Oh." she stated after a brief pause. Then she smiled at the anxious Viola, masking the fact that she was somewhat hurt by this. "That's okay. Really." the blond assured, somehow able to speak without her voice hitching in her throat which was quickly closing up.</p>
<p>"Really?" asked Viola as she removed her hands from Olivia's shoulders and slumped a bit in her stance. "'Cause I know what you did for me last night was a lot for you and I don't want to feel like I ruined your reputation or anything. That'd make me feel like a total scumbag." Olivia shook her head and she waved away Viola's objections quickly.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about. I would do anything for you, Vi- Sebestian." Olivia said honestly, pink tinging her cheeks once again at the admission. Viola blinked in surprise but shook it off in a second and went back to her happy persona in a moment by flashing her blond friend a thumbs up.</p>
<p>"That's my girl! I owe ya one, Liv... Well, make that I owe you a few... okay, a lot." Viola continued correcting herself as she took steps away from Olivia. She was about to turn around to go when something struck her. Olivia jumped back in surprise when Viola without warning whirled around and placed her faces inches from Olivia's own.</p>
<p>"Liv! We have to do a public break-up so everyone will know about it and Duke will believe me when I said I broke up with you!" Viola whispered urgently to Olivia, who was too busy staring at her lips.</p>
<p>"Uh.. Wha..?" Olivia said in embarrassment. Asking someone to repeat themselves is very unladylike, after all.</p>
<p>"Breakup with me." Viola repeated, oblivious to Olivia's plight. Olivia looked around the school hallway filled with students passing by aimlessly.</p>
<p>"Now?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Sure. Now would be g-" Viola was cut off when a hand made brutal acquaintance with her cheek with a loud <i>slap</i> that made many startled heads turn in their direction. As Viola's head whipped to the side in seemingly slow motion, the only thoughts running through her head at the moment were: <i>Whoa. Never knew Olivia had such a brutal attack up her sleeve!</i></p>
<p>A stunned Viola touched her aching cheek which now had a hot hand print on it, and looked at Olivia who had tears streaming down her cheeks and her shoulders shaking with rage. In Viola's opinion, it was very convincing.</p>
<p>"Sebastian Hastings, how dare you break up with me? You use me for your own ends and then dump me like a sack of potatoes! I should've known you weren't boyfriend material! Why can't you see what you're losing here? How dense can you be!" Olivia declared angrily as she whirled around, her long hair slapping Viola across the face before she strode off gracefully with her head held high. Viola stared after her, somewhat dumbstruck by the performance.</p>
<p>"Wow, she is a very good actress!" Viola murmured to herself amongst the loud whispers of "Yes! Now Sebastian is single!" now emanating from the small crowd that had formed. She rubbed her now numb cheek as the thought occurred to her that it almost seemed like her blond friend <i>wasn't</i> acting.</p>
<p>As Olivia walked away from the scene of the breakup she felt somewhat releived that she could get all of that information off her chest. She had finally been able to express many of her feelings of frustration to Viola under a false pretense, but hey! Viola might maybe, <i>just maybe</i>, take a hint and realize that she wasn't faking her current emotional state.</p>
