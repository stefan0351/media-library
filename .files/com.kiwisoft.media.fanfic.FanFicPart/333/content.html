<!-- High School Hell \ A Slow Leak -->

<p>Life in the Palace slowly returned to normal, or whatever passed for normal there these days at least. They started looking and acting like a typical American family, if you could get past the fact that the two soon-to-be-stepsisters were deeply in love. And gradually, both Sam and Brooke's nightmares ended. Sure, every once in a while there was a subtle reminder of what had happened that warm spring night, but for the most part, things were looking better. </p>
<p>Sam and Brooke had settled into a routine that worked for them and Mike, keeping things on the down low when he was around and making sure that they had time to themselves when he wasn't around. They were happy and content and outside of those that they had told, no one else knew. They didn't mind being `out' to their friends but it was no one else's business, in their opinion. So they lived in their own little bubble, careful for their family's sake as well as their own not to be too obvious and for the most part, they were successful. Until that pesky little leak started. </p>
<p>It's like a leaky faucet, first it starts as an annoying drip that you try to ignore but then, as time passes and more water builds up, the drip increases to steady drizzle until it's a steady stream and can't be ignored anymore. And then you're screwed. You have to deal with it. But there isn't exactly a 24-hour repairman for this sort of thing. And no one knew exactly where the leak started from for sure, but bets were placed in the Mary Cherry/ Sugar Daddy direction. </p>
<p>School was becoming an increasingly tense place for both girls with the whispers and glances behind their backs. It's hard to ignore it when people glare at you or stare at you like sideshow freaks. It was especially hard for Brooke, she was used to attention but it was usually the positive and worshipping kind, not the `ew' kind. And then there were the bits and pieces of conversations one or both would pick up on: </p>
<p>1) "Did you hear about McQueen and McPherson, dude? I hear they're doing each other!" </p>
<p>"No way! There's a sandwich I wouldn't mind being the meat in!" </p>
<p>"Oh yeah!" </p>
<p>2) "Sam and Brooke? The same two girls who've hated each other since grade school? You've got to be kidding me!" </p>
<p>"Nope, I heard it from my best friend's sister's boyfriend's cousin who saw them last week kissing out at Make-Out point!" </p>
<p>"Oh My God! Then it must be true!" </p>
<p>3) "That is just disgusting, I feel sorry for their parents."</p>
<p>And so on and so forth. If the snatches of conversations and hairy eyeballs the girls were getting weren't bad enough, it got worse one Wednesday morning when they got to school. Written across Sam's locker in big black letters was Dyke; while on Brooke's locker was McQueer. Brooke dropped her bag and just stared at her locker in shock. Sam looked over and inspected Brooke's locker. </p>
<p>"Absolutely no points for originality," she said dryly. Brooke glared at her. </p>
<p>"It's not funny, Sam," she sighed. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"No, Princess, it's not. But what can you do, hunt down every ignorant and intolerant asshole on school property? That wouldn't leave anyone for class except maybe our friends. Besides, it's only paint," she said calmly. Suddenly she reached around and dug through her bag until she found a big black Sharpie marker. With a triumphant grin, she proceeded to change the `r' in `queer' to an `n' so basically Brooke's locker just said her name. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"What about yours?" she asked. Sam looked back at her locker and shrugged again. </p>
<p>"Who cares? Let them call me what they want. I love you and no amount of namecalling is going to change that. Sticks and stones," she taunted. Brooke kissed her lightly on the lips as several people walked by. (Why hide it now when everyone obviously knows?) </p>
<p>"Get a room, you two, that's disgusting," Becky Wright, a junior, snapped as she walked by. Sam glared. </p>
<p>"What's the matter, Beck? Jealous?" Sam asked, her voice full of scorn. Becky turned purple with rage and stomped away. Brooke turned to see Sam smiling, satified with herself. </p>
<p>"It might not be a good idea to piss people off like that, Sam," she pointed out softly. "They're obviously not taking this well." Sam thought about this a minute and nodded. </p>
<p>"I know but, Jesus, Brooke, this is California. Half the state is in the closet for God's sake, they just won't admit it," she joked. "But I'll take it easy and try not to let my temper get the best of me, promise." </p>
<p>"So, what's on the agenda for today?" Brooke asked, getting her books out of her graffitti'd locker and wanting to just start the day over again. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Let's see, French class, Trig, the usual thinly disguided torture sessions that they try and pass off as educational. After school I thought we'd hang out or something although Mom wants to go shopping for wedding stuff when she gets home from work," Sam answered with a roll of her eyes. She was so not looking forward to the wedding. It wasn't that she didn't want her mother to marry Mike, it was just that the last formal event she'd attended had ended horribly with her in a wheelchair and lots and lots of pain. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"Come on, Sammy, shopping for the wedding will be fun," she chirped. Sam stuck out her tongue. </p>
<p>"Oh goody," she groaned sarcastically. </p>

<p>"This day just keeps getting better and better," Sam mumbled as she leaned against her car and waited for the tow truck. She was absolutely livid and trying not to show it. Brooke rubbed her back in slow circles trying to keep her calm, knowing exactly how upset she was. They'd gone out to her car to go home for lunch, Senior priviledges and all, and found not only had someone spray painted the word `BUTCH' across the side of the car, but slashed all four tires as well. </p>
<p>"How much you wanna bet it was Becky and her cronies?" Sam snapped. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I don't think Becky has enough brain cells to think of doing something like this," she said calmly. Sam snorted. </p>
<p>"Probably not," she agreed. "God, Mom is going to kill me," she complained. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"Why? It's not your fault." Sam just looked at her sadly.</p>
<p>"No, but this is going to be expensive to fix and with the wedding coming up she's not going to want to waste the money," Sam answered with a tinge of annoyance. Brooke nodded in understanding. As much as Sam loved Brooke and Jane loved Mike, they both disliked using the McQueen money. They'd been self-sufficient for so long that the thought of spending someone else's money was distasteful to them. </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, Sammy," Brooke said gently. "If all else fails, you can earn the money around the house." Sam shot her a look but then smiled devilishly. </p>
<p>"Are you in the market for a personal slave, Ms McQueen?" she teased while batting her eyes and attempting to look tempting. Brooke laughed out loud at the display. While Sam did look tempting, she also resembled a Cocker Spaniel. Sam frowned at the laughter and stuck out her bottom lip in a pout. </p>
<p>"Please don't do that, Sam. If you do, we'll be arrested for committing a lewd act in public AND on school property," Brooke warned. Sam's eyebrows attempted to leap up off her forehead. </p>
<p>"No one's gonna be home until after five, right?" Sam asked. Brooke nodded. "Thank God." </p>
