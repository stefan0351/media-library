<p>Jake pressuring Miley into telling Lily the truth had finally paid off and so the two girls were meeting at Rico's to have a real conversation.</p>
<p>Miley was the first to arrive, as her house was the closest to the beach. Three minutes later Lily came bounding across the sand and went straight up to her friend.</p>
<p>"Hi." Miley smiled.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>"So…"</p>
<p>Lily looked straight into Miley's eyes, "I love you…"</p>
<p>Miley immediately broke into a wide smile. "I love you soooo much too."</p>
<p>"I said it first." Lily joked.</p>
<p>"But…" Lily poked her tongue out at her friend and noticed Miley was staring at her lips. A moment later Miley brought her lips together with Lily's in a gentle and caring kiss. Their first kiss.</p>
<p>When they pulled apart they both were blushing a strong red colour. "I love you Lily." Miley took the other girls hand in her own and held it.</p>
<p>"So do you want to have a relationship?" Lily was the first to ask the big question.</p>
<p>"I do. Do you?" Lily nodded, not taking her eyes off her new girlfriend. She pulled Miley closer to her and moved her lips onto her girlfriends. After a moment, Miley brushed her tongue against Lily's lips asking for an invitation. She was allowed and so the two girls started to discover each other a little more.</p>
<p>After a few minutes they pulled apart, puffing heavily. It was the most loving and passionate kiss either of them had ever shared.</p>
<p>Silence ensued, each deep in thought.</p>
<p>"Lily?"</p>
<p>"Yes?" She looked up at her friend.</p>
<p>"Are you..what I mean is…?"</p>
<p>"A lesbian?" Miley nodded. "Yes, I think I am. What about you?"</p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure I'm bisexual." Lily understood and she loved that about her.</p>
<p>They were quiet again. The sun was slowly but surely setting and each knew they should be getting back home. They came together for one last kiss before going their own separate ways.</p>
<p><b>END.</b></p>
