<!-- The Grrls Club \ Chapter Three: What Is A Pash? -->

<p><u>Delaney Quarters</u></p>
		<p>Ten extremely drunken members of the inaugural grrls club sat around empty bottles and cushions that were scattered everywhere. </p>
		<p>Tarzi grabbed an empty bottle and span it in a circle.</p>
		<p>"Whatja doing Tarzi?" slurred Cha'Hal </p>
		<p>"Spin the bottle is a VERY different game!" giggled Michelle.</p>
		<p>"Yeah but what a game" winked B'Elanna</p>
		<p>"That must be a very good game given the size of your smile B'Elanna Torres" smiled Seven.</p>
		<p>Seven thought is such a game gave B'Elanna a smile like that then she'd love to play that game.</p>
		<p>"No I am not starting a game of spin the bottle. It's a variation of truth and dare" Explained Tarzi</p>
		<p>"You see I spin the bottle and who ever it lands on and this case it was Susan, she now gets the chance to ask every one the same truth question when her turn arises"</p>
		<p>"Yippee I get to ask the same question to all of you. THIS is going to be fun!" hiccupped Susan</p>
		<p>"Then I spin the bottle again" Tarzi gave the bottle a spin " this time who ever it lands on gets the rest of us to complete the same dare"</p>
		<p>This time the bottle stopped at Kathryn.</p>
		<p>"Well Susan you get the truth but can you all handle the mother of all dares" giggled Kathryn</p>
		<p>"Oh! We are in sooooo much trouble," said B'Elanna in mock horror.</p>
		<p>"Ok honey since it was your suggestion to play this game why don't you ask first. So who is it going to be babe" crooned Michelle</p>
		<p>Cha'Hal looked over everyone twice. " Hmmm who to choose let me see mmmmmm. I am going to choose megsie baby! Okkkkkayyy Megan truth or dare!!!"</p>
		<p>"Oh shit Cha'Hal, I choose .....TRUTH!" Shouts of boring rang through the room.</p>
		<p>"Well so!!!! Cant help it if I am BORING, Bring it on Cha'Hal" burped Megan</p>
		<p>"Your anything BUT boring Megs. Go get her Cha'Hal sic" Jennifer pointed to her sister and matched her burp.</p>
		<p>"Ok Megsie baby, truth, how come you were covered in big purple spots about a month ago"</p>
		<p>Jennifer started to laugh very loudly, because she was privy to the information that was about to be shared.</p>
		<p>"Out with it" shouted everyone in the room.</p>
		<p>"Ok ok well it was like this, I wanted a couple of days off sooooooo I got this hypospray that was filled with this ink that Carey said would look like I had Ayrean flu Spots. Instead of getting little orange dots I got huge purple spots" Megan took a side glance at Kathryn thinking that she would now be busted but all she saw was Kathryn laughing just as hard as everybody else.</p>
		<p>"It wasn't that funny!!" whined Megan</p>
		<p>"Yes it was" answered Jennifer "Especially the big spot on your bum!" All the grrls were now rolling around the floor.</p>
		<p>"Ha ha, It's my turn NOW" Megan looks menacingly around the room. "Who's laughing the most. KATHRYN! Truth or dare!" Kathryn did not want to be labeled boring </p>
		<p>"Dare Megan"</p>
		<p>"Yeah way to go Kathryn" Hollered B'Elanna</p>
		<p>"Ok Let me think. Hey B'Elanna can you make that console show a picture of Engineering. You know like a spy camera of what they are doing there now sort of thing?"</p>
		<p>"Sure that's really easy Megan" answered B'Elanna. Megan grinned a very devilish grin.</p>
		<p>"I know that grin Kathryn and someone IS IN TROUBLE" hiccupped Jennifer.</p>
		<p>"Ok B'Elanna do it" B'Elanna tapped a few commands into the computer console, then up popped engineering.</p>
		<p>"Glad to see the gamma shift working" laughed Susan</p>
		<p>"Now Kathryn your dare is to transport Lt. Carey's clothes of off him and Kathryn I mean ALL of them!"</p>
		<p>The room burst into giggles and hoots.</p>
		<p>"You call that a dare this is easy peezy" giggled Kathryn. Everyone watched as Kathryn tapped into the computer system and within a couple of seconds the grrls club was looking at a very naked and confused Lt. Carey. The rest of Engineering took a second before they were all laughing.</p>
		<p>Howls of laughter went up in the room.</p>
		<p>"That's nothing. Wait till Commander Chakotay wakes up with Lt. Carey's clothes on his bed!"</p>
		<p>"Oh shit that's so priceless Kathryn" hollered Tarzi</p>
		<p>Kathryn waited till the laughing had died down to a few giggles and snorts here and there.</p>
		<p>Kathryn looked around the room "ok every one is in this dare. I am using my winnings"</p>
		<p>A sly mischievous smile crept over Kathryn's face.</p>
		<p>"I do not like the look on your face Kathryn Janeway, I believe the term is SHIT we are in so much trouble" grinned Samantha.</p>
		<p>"Now who is in the BIG chair this fine evening" Kathryn queried the grrls as if they were in a 20th century classroom. </p>
		<p>"Ensign Harry Kim is in command of the ship during this Gamma shift" said Seven</p>
		<p>"Right you are Michelle, Ensign Kim is in residency of the chair. No doubt practicing his command. So it is about time he gets the royal salute!"</p>
		<p>"The royal salute?" Question Tarzi</p>
		<p>" I haven't heard of that one" said Cha'Hal </p>
		<p>"That must be a first for you Cha'Hal" laughed Michelle</p>
		<p>"Shuddup Michelle"</p>
		<p>"Ok so what is it Kathryn" asked B'Elanna</p>
		<p>" Well I can't let these illegal transporter codes go to waste now can I" smiled Kathryn</p>
		<p>" Come on Kathryn, What do WE have to do?" asked Cha'Hal</p>
		<p>"Well you all have to line up over there, face the other way and then you have to bare your BUMS!"</p>
		<p>"As in you want us all to throw a brown eye" Laughed Cha'Hal</p>
		<p>"Yep you got it grrl, nine little gorgeous bums"</p>
		<p>"But how is that going to give Kim the royal salute?" queried Susan</p>
		<p>"Well as you lot a flashing your bums, I am transporting you all to the bridge right in front of Ensign Kim and Seven here is taking the Holocamera picture for prosperity"</p>
		<p>"What a Hoot Kathryn!" giggled Megan</p>
		<p>Kathryn proceeded to line four grrls up either side of Seven, but facing the other way. They were all getting to show their bums.</p>
		<p>"Ok on three, one... two... three!" yelled Kathryn.</p>
		<p>The transporter beam took hold of the nine grrls. 20 seconds later they were in the Delaney quarters pulling up their Pj bottoms. They all rushed over to the holocamera that Seven was holding. As soon as they all saw Harry's face the howls of laughter grew very loud.</p>
		<p>"Oh god look at his face, It's priceless" howled B'Elanna "Where did you learn that one Kathryn?"</p>
		<p>"I was on the Science Vessel Palmyra, doing my first trip to the big chair. The look on MY face was just as priceless" more howls of laughter followed Kathryn's Confession.</p>
		<p>"Now Seven since you didn't show your bottom, I think in all fairness you should complete a dare!"</p>
		<p>Kathryn hoped she has been reading Seven and B'Elanna correctly all evening.</p>
		<p>" Yeh! We think that's a great idea" Cha'Hal and Michelle agreed with Kathryn as did all the other grrls there.</p>
		<p>" I will comply Kathryn, What is the dare?" answered Seven</p>
		<p>"Mmm I think you should go over to B'Elanna and give her a kiss" giggled Kathryn</p>
		<p>B'Elanna's eyes were as big as sauces. A small grin then spread over her lips. `You Beauty' she thought.</p>
		<p>"Oh and on the lips Seven" added Kathryn quickly.</p>
		<p>Seven smiled sweetly. She walked over to B'Elanna and invaded her space, not that she minded.</p>
		<p>Seven bent her head slightly lower and then she brushed her lips ever so softly across B'Elanna's `mm soft and sweet' thought both of the grrls. The kiss was over in a second.</p>
		<p>" Nah! That wasn't a kiss Seven" laughed Cha'Hal " I am sure what Kathryn meant was a huge pash!"</p>
		<p>"Kathryn did say a kiss on the lips. Was that not such a kiss?" queried Seven</p>
		<p>"Yes she did and it was, but I think it was meant to big and passionate" answered Cha'Hal. The rest of the grrls nodded in agreement except B'Elanna. She was still standing there with a huge puppy love grin on her face. `WOW she kissed me' was going over and over in her head.</p>
		<p>Samantha suddenly smiled a huge wicked smile. She looked over at Kathryn and winked then she went across to Seven and whispered in her ear.</p>
		<p>Seven's eyes lit up like a Terran Xmas tree.</p>
		<p>"It is my turn to ask the question?" asked Seven</p>
		<p>The group nodded in agreement. Seven turned and face B'Elanna and stated "B'Elanna I dare you to kiss me passionately"</p>
		<p>You could have heard a pin drop in the room, that is until Samantha and Kathryn started to giggle.</p>
		<p>"Oy! B'Elanna" Michelle snapped her fingers in front of the stunned engineer. " You going to stand there all night or are you going to accept the dare! I do believe Seven IS waiting"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna snapped out of her trance. "I've never not completed a dare Michelle"</p>
		<p>As B'Elanna moved Closer to Seven she thought ` I can do this, God she is so beautiful Shit keep it together grrl I Can do this'</p>
		<p>B'Elanna stood toe to toe with Seven. She whispered so only she could hear " You sure you want to do this?"</p>
		<p>She searched Seven's face for an answer. She saw blue eyes that were sparkling with desire and a big smile across her face. B'Elanna knew it was ok to continue.</p>
		<p>As B'Elanna moved her lips slowly closer to Seven's she wrapped her hands around her waist.</p>
		<p>Their eyes closed as their lips met B'Elanna pulled Seven in closer. The lips pressed together.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna gently started to prise Sevens lips open; she met with no resistance only a soft moan.</p>
		<p>She gently moved her tongue in and around Seven's mouth and lips. A louder moan escaped Seven's lips. Their kiss deepened. Seven's tongue began its own dance around B'Elanna's mouth and lips. Seven moved her hands to the back of B'Elanna's head. The kiss heated up considerably.</p>
		<p>"Hell this is getting so HOT!" giggled Jennifer.</p>
		<p>"Woo HOO way to go B'Elanna. I think MY toes are curling up!" hooted Tarzi</p>
		<p>As the cat calls got louder, B'Elanna and Seven stared to break off their kiss.</p>
		<p>"WOW!" Stated Seven</p>
		<p>The room laughed at the most human response they had ever heard from Seven.</p>
		<p>"Wow indeed Seven" agreed B'Elanna as she stole a quick kiss from Seven.</p>
		<p>Michelle and Cha'Hal high fived each other and giggled softly " looks like we have two more grrls added to the flock"</p>
		<p>"Right you're ALL in trouble cause if I am correct, which I am, It's my turn" growled B'Elanna</p>
		<p>"And I choose ....Samantha! Truth or Dare?"</p>
		<p>" Hmm the dares look good I'll choose the Dare!"</p>
		<p>`Great' thought B'Elanna ` time to get Kathryn an early Xmas gift' she had notice over the year her friend checking out Samantha once or twice when she thought know one was looking.</p>
		<p>"Samantha you have to passionately kiss" she paused for effect then yelled "KATHRYN"</p>
		<p>Samantha froze she thought  ` how'd she know. Was she that obvious'</p>
		<p>"Way to go B'Elanna" was said but by who was lost through the giggles that followed.</p>
		<p>Whilst the hollering and hooting was going on Kathryn had moved closer to Samantha. She whispered "You don't have to do this if you don't want to"</p>
		<p>"I do," whispered Samantha. "More than anything Kathryn" She thought she'd just thought it but the smile across Kathryn's face confirmed that once again Samantha had said her thoughts out loud.</p>
		<p>Kathryn took the initiative. She pulled Samantha in closer and leaned in for the kiss.</p>
		<p>"Hey looks like Kathryn is keen, VERY KEEN" giggled Jennifer</p>
		<p>"Shhhshhhh" replied Michelle</p>
		<p>Samantha's hands were entwined in Kathryn's red hair. Kathryn's were softly caressing Sam's back and bottom. Their tongues were gently fighting each other's. As the kiss deepened soft moans were coming from their mouths but from who was indistinguishable. The room was definitely hotting up!</p>
		<p>" Shit I thought that Seven and B'Elanna's kiss was hot but this THIS takes the cake!" laughed Cha'Hal</p>
		<p>Kathryn hearing the start of cat calling gently released Samantha's lips with a little nips and kisses as she pulled away. Samantha added her own small parting kiss. Both looked at each other and saw love and desire.</p>
		<p>Samantha panicked, she quickly untangled her hands from Kathryn's hair and fled out the door, mumbling something about being late and she should get back to Naomi.</p>
		<p>"SHIT!" said Kathryn to no one in particular and went after Samantha. The room was in stunned silence except for the little snores emitting from the corner of the room where both Susan and Megan were curled up asleep.</p>
		<p>"Well that was one way to end the night!" said Jennifer</p>
