<p>Read this online today and thought I'd make it a Liley.</p>
<p>I <b>DID NOT</b> write this story. I might add a few scenes and changed a few lines here and there in the future but, still, this is story is not mine; book called <u>Romance or Something Like It</u> by Gerri Hill. Enjoy!</p>
<p>"I hate these things," Miley told her best friend.</p>
<p>"What's not to like? Valentine's Day. Dancing and women. You can't beat it," Joannie told her.</p>
<p>"I'm pretending to be your date. It's not like I'll be doing a lot of dancing," Miley complained as they walked along the dark sidewalk to the bar.</p>
<p>"True. But jealously is the best way, we both agreed."</p>
<p>"No. You agreed. I was just too stupid and went along with it."</p>
<p>"Mikayla is beautiful," Joannie sighed. "Wait until you see her. And when she sees me with you... tall, dark and beautiful, she'll know that she made a big mistake by saying we should see other people."</p>
<p>"That is so adolescent," Miley sighed. "You can't make someone like you, Joannie."</p>
<p>"What's not to like? I'm such a catch." She announced proudly.</p>
<p>"Sure you are. That's why you're still single," Miley pointed out.</p>
<p>"You're a great catch and <i>you're </i>still single," Joannie retorted.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "When I meet the right woman, then I'll be caught, but not until. Besides, I've been called difficult."</p>
<p>"Well, there's that," Joannie said as they approached the entrance of the bar and gathered with the other women waiting to get inside. "You're too picky. My God, look at you. You could have anyone you wanted, but no one's ever good enough. What are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"I'm looking for love at first sight," Miley said seriously.</p>
<p>"That doesn't exist. Only in fairy tales; out here in the real world, you've got to lie and cheat just to find a date."</p>
<p>Miley laughed. "I don't think so. I want to meet someone, look into her eyes, and fall hopelessly in love. And know, right then . . . right there, that she's the one."</p>
<p>"Oh, please." Joannie scoffed. "You're dreaming. And then you get to know her and find you have absolutely nothing in common and you can't find a thing to talk about, especially after the fun in bed disappears. Then what's left?"</p>
<p>"Then we weren't really in love to begin with," She shrugged.</p>
<p>"You're going to be alone for a very long time, Miley. You've got to start small and then work up. And that's what I'm doing with Mikayla. We had a great time together. We laughed, we both love music, the movies."</p>
<p>"Then why are you pretending to date me?"</p>
<p>"Because she said she wasn't ready to commit to anything. Hell, it's not like I'm looking to get married and have kids; I just want to date for a while. But, she says we should see others, too. I hate when they say that. And if she sees me with you, well, then she'll know what she's missing out on."</p>
<p>"You have a warped view, Joannie. It's lying. Why can't you be honest with her and tell her you really like her and you want to continue seeing her?"</p>
<p>"Like I said, you have to lie and cheat." Both girls reached for their money when they reached the door, but Joannie put her hand on Miley's arm. "My treat, sweetheart," she said with a grin.</p>
<p>"Listen, if you try and kiss me, I'll deck you right here," Miley threatened in a low voice.</p>
<p>"You're all talk. I know you've had the hots for me for years," Joannie teased.</p>
<p>"Right," Miley murmured. Again, she couldn't believe she'd let Joannie talk her into this. She hated Valentine's Day anyway. And pretending to be Joannie's date to make someone else jealous . . . Jesus, had she been that drunk when she'd agreed?</p>
<p>"Come on, hurry," Joannie said, pulling on Miley's arm. "We want to get a table close to the dance floor."</p>
<p>"You know, you'll owe me big time for this," Miley said, not for the first time.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. I've practically promised you my first born." Rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>"I certainly don't want your children. A couple of hundred dinners cooked for me is payment enough," she said.</p>
<p>"I do that for a living. What's the fun in that?" she questioned.</p>
<p>"The fun is you can be a chef at my house and not at the damn restaurant and I won't have to get all dressed up to eat some decent food."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you still don't know how to cook. My God, it's not like I haven't shown you every trick in the book." Joannie pointed across the dance floor. "There's a table. Sprint across the floor and grab it."</p>
<p>"I will not. We can at least be civilized about this." Miley said dignified.</p>
<p>"Jesus. Do you have to act like an accountant all the time?"</p>
<p>"I am an accountant." She deadpanned.</p>
<p>"You certainly don't look like an accountant. Why do you have to be one?"</p>
<p>Miley rolled her eyes. "I've been an accountant all my life. With both parents and a brother to follow, it's not like I had a choice."</p>
<p>"You could have said no. Damn, even a lawyer would have been better than an accountant."</p>
<p>"Why do you dislike my profession so?"</p>
<p>"Because it sounds so boring." She dragged on the last word. "No wonder you're single." Joannie sprinted the last few feet, sliding to a halt at the edge, and grabbing the table before a group of four descended. She smiled sweetly at them then grabbed Miley's hand. "Sit down, sweetheart. I got us a table."</p>
<p>"I could end up hating you after this, you know." Miley warned.</p>
<p>"We've been friends too long. Don't threaten me." She said knowingly.</p>
<p>Miley pulled the chair closer to the table and folded her arms on top of it, tapping her fingers lightly to the music. Country music. Could it get any worse?</p>
<p>"I'll buy the first round. What do you want?" Joannie asked.</p>
<p>"You'll buy <i>all </i>the rounds," Miley said straight-faced. "And I'll have a... Sidecar, I think."</p>
<p>"Brandy? Couldn't be a cheap date and drink beer, huh?" she deadpanned.</p>
<p>"Nope." The taller girl said with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Okay. Don't go wandering off while I'm gone." Joannie warned.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I'll be right here waiting, <i>sweetheart</i>," Miley purred.</p>
<p>"Will you slow down?" Lilly gasped as she struggled to keep up with Mikayla's long strides. "It's barely nine."</p>
<p>"It's Valentine's Day. It'll be packed."</p>
<p>"It'll be depressing," Lilly groaned. "Single women watching the couples make out, wishing we had someone, too. Then we'll just grab anybody, regardless, just not to be alone on fucking Valentine's Day. It's depressing. They ought to do away with the whole damn day."</p>
<p>"Well, you're in a fine mood," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"I hate this day. Everyone at the office getting flowers, oohing and ahhing over them like it's some big deal."</p>
<p>Mikayla stopped suddenly and Lilly nearly ran into her. "No wonder you're single, if you have this attitude."</p>
<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Lilly asked arching her eyebrow, one hand on her hip.</p>
<p>"Romance, Hun. It's all about romance." The dark haired woman said knowingly.</p>
<p>"Bullshit." Lilly said earning a displeased look from the other girl. "People send flowers because it's expected. And why only on Valentine's Day? So that others will know that somebody loves somebody else? You shouldn't have to have an occasion. If you love somebody, you shouldn't need a day to prove it." Her voice was full of bitter.</p>
<p>"You are so cynical. I don't know why I asked you to come along." Mikayla said faking regret.</p>
<p>"I don't know why you <i>insisted </i>I come along," Lilly said. "I was perfectly happy staying home. I had plenty of work to do."</p>
<p>"You always stay home. Ever since you broke things off with Sarah, you've been staying home. You've got to get a life sometimes." Mikayla reminded putting a hand on Lilly's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't bring her up," Lilly warned. "Not tonight."</p>
<p>Taking her hand away, "Fine, but my God, it's been two years. Surely you're over that by now."</p>
<p>"Of course I'm over it," Lilly stated. "I kicked her out, remember?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"I did. I distinctly remember packing her things after I hadn't seen her in two weeks. That's kicking her out."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. The fact that she sent her brothers to pick up her stuff and move it to her <i>other</i> girlfriend's apartment means nothing."</p>
<p>"I <i>hate</i> you. Can't you forget that minor detail?"</p>
<p>Mikayla laughed and playfully punched Lilly's arm.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. She was just such a bitch. I can't believe you lasted as long as you did."</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk about her," Lilly said. "And you're paying, right? I mean, this was totally your idea."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm paying," Mikayla groaned as they moved to the end of the line, waiting to get inside the bar. "I'm a lowly secretary and you're an attorney, but I'm paying."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Lilly said sweetly. "I refuse to contribute to this holiday."</p>
<p>There are the first two chapters. Miley and Lilly don't meet until the third, but I just wanted to post these first two to see if anyone would want me to continue. If yes, please review and let me know. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>And just so you know in case i forgot to change a name: Dana is Joannie, Jamie is Miley, Tess is Mikayla, and Kate is Lilly. Just to clarify. Thank you!</p>
