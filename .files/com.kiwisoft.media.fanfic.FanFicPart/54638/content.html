<!-- Change Of Mind \ Part 2 -->

<p>After a long discomforted minute, Mia looked at Ally and said, "Maybe I
should go home now."</p>

<p>Looking back with a regretful face Ally replied, "Yeah, maybe it's best
that way."</p>

<p>Mia went for her coat and put it on as she stood before the door. "It was a
nice dinner. Maybe... We could do it again?" she said as she hugged Ally.</p>

<p>"Mmm... We should really do it again..." Ally answered, she hesitated
before she added, "But only as friends."</p>

<p>Mia got a disappointed look as she realized that Ally didn't want anything
serious with her. She nodded and repeated, "Okey... as friends. Call me."</p>

<p>"I will." Ally replied, she smiled relieved that Mia didn't hate her for
implying something else than friendship.</p>

<p>In the gangway down to the outer door Mia sighed, disappointed but she
tried to cheer herself up by admitting that she at least had been on a
date. The first date for a long time.</p>

<p>When Ally had closed the door behind Mia, Renee steps up next to her
looking interested on her roommate. Ally noticed her curiosity and prepared
herself on an interrogation.</p>

<p>"So. Who was she?" Renee asked smiling.</p>

<p>"A friend." Ally smiled back.</p>

<p>"A friend that you had dinner with?" Renee looked at Ally with a mock
suspicious look. "Not a date?"</p>

<p>"Yes just a simple dinner!" Ally exclaimed irritation expressed on her
entire body. Renee gave her the look she always gave when she didn't
believe her. "Okay..." Ally confessed. "It was kind of a date-dinner,
dinner-date. Whatever you want to call it." she continued waving her arms
around in the air.</p>

<p>"Aha. Was it good?" Renee continued her merciless questioning.</p>

<p>"Yeah... I would probably had sex with her if you hadn't come home." Ally
replied quietly.</p>

<p>"And that would have been wrong?" Renee asked afraid the answer would be
no.</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't love her. I was just interested in her body." Ally said,
still with a low voice. "Besides I'm in love with someone else so I would
have felt that I betrayed her."</p>

<p>"So you really are gay?" Renee said as she sat down beside Ally.</p>

<p>"What's that suppose to mean? don't you want me to be gay or what?" Ally
said anger flashing through her eyes.</p>

<p>"Uh... No. I'm just a bit shocked, I thought it was just some fantasy of
yours." Renee defended herself.</p>

<p>"You mean you wanted it to be one of my fantasies right?" Ally asked
miserably filling her as she heard how her best friend rejected her
feelings as mere fantasies.</p>

<p>"Yes.." Renee said after a long moment of silence.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is just one of my fantasies... I don't really know. It happened
so quickly. One minute I had never thought about it. Then in the next, I
thought about it almost all the time." Ally shook her head almost crying.</p>

<p>Renee closed her arms around Ally in a soothing motion and said, "Well,
whatever you choose to be I will always be here for you." smiling Renee
continued with a teasing tone, "But don't expect me to have sex with you."</p>

<p>"Renee!" Ally exclaimed, looking angry on her friend. "why on earth would
I want to have sex with you?" she then asked.</p>

<p>"I was just joking." Renee replied very amused.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know." Ally said looking sad. The look disappeared as her lips
cracked up into a smile.</p>

<p>"That's the way you should look." Renee said pleased her little joke had
made Ally smile.</p>

<p>Renee looked at her watch. "It's late, I think I'm going off to bed. I'm
meeting a potential client early tomorrow."</p>

<p>"It's best I do it too."</p>

<p>"Are you fine then?"</p>

<p>"I'm doing okay. Nothing different from other days." Ally replied,
smiling a weak smile to reinsure Renee that she was ok.</p>

<p>"Okay, sleep well."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally walked into her office, only to discover Ling there wrapped up in
Mia's arms. "We don't really need that fake-gay bitch" Ling said after she
and Mia broke their kiss.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I tried to be nice at her, and what did it give me? Just a simple
fucking, 'I just wanna be friends'!" Mia replied with a bad imitation of
Ally.</p>

<p>"Hey! What is this?" Ally asked looking crestfallen at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling looked back at Ally with a wicked grin. "This is what you get for
cheating on me."</p>

<p>With a scream Ally woke up her body dripped of sweat.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Renee came hurriedly in Ally's bedroom, looking almost
afraid.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Renee and began to cry. Renee walked over to Ally and tried
to comfort her as best as she could.</p>

<p>"I... I h... Had such a nightmare." Ally managed to say between her sobs.</p>

<p>"What was it about?" </p>

<p>"I walked into my office and right there Ling made out with Mia. They
talked about me and how evil I was. When I asked what they were doing, Ling
responded that it was payback for cheating on her." Ally told Renee about
the dream with long pauses while she told it.</p>

<p>"And why was it so horrible?" Renee asked not really understanding what
in the dream was so bad.</p>

<p>"Her eyes when she looked at me." Ally explained. "They accused me for
not loving her." Ally blew her nose. "She hates me..."</p>

<p>"Why would she do that?"</p>

<p>"Because she saw us at the restaurant." Ally replied.</p>

<p>"She spied on you?" Renee asked shocked. Not believing ice-queen Ling
would ever do such a thing as spy on Ally.</p>

<p>"Yes... She was there. A... And when I saw her I got angry and revenged
on her by kissing Mia. Poor Mia. I hope she isn't angry on me for using
her." Ally said as she began to sob again.</p>

<p>"You... Kissed Mia?" Renee asked half in surprise half in chock.</p>

<p>"Yeah... It was actually the best kiss I've had for a long time." Ally
confessed. "Well except the one with Ling, of course."</p>

<p>"I must get used to this I think." Renee finally said shaking her head in
disbelief.</p>

<p>Finally finished with her crying Ally asked, "What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Time to go up and get ready for work." Renee replied as she went for the
bathroom.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As soon as Ally stepped out of the elevator she noticed how everyone was
staring at her. Frowning she went into her office almost expecting to see
what she had dreamt about. The people at Cage/Fish and Associates Law firm
remembered the scene that had happened only minutes before Ally had entered
the firm office. Richard had asked Ling something and Ling had replied with
an angry screaming voice, "Don't ever mention ms McBeal's name for me
again! Or I will rip your damn tongue out!" She then hurried back into her
office and closing the door with a hard slam. Leaving Richard lost of
words.</p>

<p>Elaine approached Richard after Ling had left him. "What did you ask her?"
she asked hoping for some juicy gossip.</p>

<p>"I just asked her if she knew where Ally had been last night since she
weren't either here or at the pub." Richard said with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>"They were having an argument yesterday after their lunch with that
representative." Elaine said.</p>

<p>"Did you hear about what?" Richard asked now really interested.</p>

<p>"No, just something about a date Ally would have with the
representative." Elaine said with a disappointed look.</p>

<p>Before Richard could continue the conversation, Ally came out of the
elevator making everyone looking at her. She seemed not to really notice it
and went for her office immediately barely greeting the others.</p>

<p>As soon she had closed her door, Ling came out of her room and went
straight for Ally's office. Closing it as she went in without knocking.
Elaine and Richard almost run down to eavesdrop on them.</p>

<p>Ally looked up into two diamond hard eyes dark as two opals when she heard
someone entered her office. Bracing herself for the other woman's words she
said, "Yes, can I help you?"</p>

<p>Giving Ally a fake smile Ling said, "And how was Mia in bed?" giving Ally
another plastic smile. "I hope you didn't enjoyed it at all."</p>

<p>"We didn't do anything. All we did was having a dinner, dancing..."</p>

<p>"Dancing! You call that dancing?!" Ling screamed out, her body screaming
out anger. "You two practically fucked right there on the dance-floor while
everyone was looking!" she continued with the same infuriated tone.</p>

<p>"We were just dancing." Ally replied between clenched teeth. "Who gave
you the right to spy on us anyway." she added, her voice raising to the
same level as Lings.</p>

<p>"You threw away our promise!" Ling countered, ignoring Ally's accusation.</p>

<p>"So what?!" Ally now stood in front of Ling, reaching some inches higher
over the angry Asian woman. "You have no right to decide who I'm dating or
kissing or having sex with. Gee, who do you think you are? My wife?" Ally
continued. "We kissed once! Hell, that kiss didn't mean shit.</p>

<p>When she finally had to stop to breath, Ling simply looked at her. "You
don't even comprehend how much I hate you right now." was all she said
before she left the room. When she opened the door she discovered that
Elaine and Richard had eavesdropped on them. She punched Richard right in
the stomach making him bend over grasping for air, while Elaine was fast
enough to get out of reach from Ling's fist. Ling then went for the
elevator leaving the office.</p>

<p>Ally who had followed her to her own office door regretted every word she
had said to Ling. She wished that Ling wouldn't make her so angry. Noticing
that Ling left without her coat she hurried over to Lings room and
retrieved it and then went to the elevator only stopping to have enough
time to kick Richard in the bottom and give Elaine a threatening look. She
soon disappeared as the elevator doors closed.</p>

<p>Elaine went quickly over to Richard to see how he was. Still grasping for
air he managed to gasp out, "What the hell is it with those two?"</p>

<p>Elaine thought for a short moment and were just going to spill it she
shrugged it off, but then decided to share it anyway. "I think they are in
love."</p>

<p>Richard began to laugh but stopped since it hurt too much. "Yeah right.
Maybe Ally is in love with Ling but Ling is as straight as you and me." he
said after a long series of coughs and trying to get air.</p>

<p>"Yeah but they do act strange..."</p>

<p>Billy and Georgia came up beside them as did Nelle and John.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Billy asked as he looked down on Richard who still
hadn't stood up.</p>

<p>"Ling knocked him down and then went away somewhere in the elevator.
Shortly Ally followed her." Elaine summed it all up.</p>

<p>"Nelle, do you know what's wrong with them?" John asked turning to her.</p>

<p>"Nope." Nelle answered. "Ling haven't told me anything. Well... Except
that she had a dream where she kissed Ally." Nelle looked at the others.
"She came to me and asked if she was gay because of the dream." Nelle got
an amused look as she continued, "I told her that she of course wasn't gay
because of that, that it was a normal fantasy. Anyway later they had dinner
and then the day after they kissed in Ally's office. She didn't tell me any
details but I think she really liked the kiss."</p>

<p>"They... They kissed?" Richard managed to blurt out. He was so shocked
that he forgot he was hurt and stood up, making him wince over and fall to
the floor once again.</p>

<p>"You're kidding." Billy exclaimed, looking surprised at Nelle.</p>

<p>"No I'm not."</p>

<p>"What? When? How could I miss that?" Elaine blurted out angry she had
missed such an important gossip.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally looked at both directions before she spotted Ling walking down the
street. She hurried after her and was soon at her side. She held out the
coat and said, "You forgot this."</p>

<p>Ling ignored her even though it was clear that she was freezing.</p>

<p>"Take the damn coat!" Ally exclaimed irritated as she showed it right in
the arms of Ling.</p>

<p>"Why?" Ling asked looking at her.</p>

<p>"It's cold out here." Ally replied trying to not sound too concerned.</p>

<p>"I meant, why do you care?" Ling explained with a soft voice, not like
her at all.</p>

<p>"Because I do... I do care about you." Ally answered, her voice as soft
as Ling's. "What ever I say or do I always care about you." she continued.</p>

<p>"Even when you date others and have sex with them?"</p>

<p>"What? I didn't have any sex with Mia!" realizing she was screaming Ally
continued in a lower tone, "You don't have any right to tell me who I am
dating or having sex with. We have both dated since our kiss."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but they were just guys. Now it was a girl."</p>

<p>"Does that really matter to you?" Ally was surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes it does. Before I was the only woman you had really kissed. I was
special to you. Now I'm not just someone you'll forget." Ling explained,
her voice barely audible.</p>

<p>"You want me to feel you are special?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ally stepped forward and closed the space between them and hugged ling
tightly. "You are special for me..." she said.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Ally replied as she began to kiss Ling.</p>

<p>Ling broke contact immediately. "What are you doing?" she asked frowning at
Ally.</p>

<p>"I... I..." Ally couldn't say a word surprised at Lings reaction.</p>

<p>"Why were you trying to kiss me? I don't want to kiss you." Ling
continued angry eyes looking at Ally.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling with surprise then suddenly blurted out, "You damn
bitch you were just playing with me! Go to hell!" she began to walk back to
her office.</p>

<p>Taken aback by Ally's words Ling simply stood and watched her walk away.
Several moments passed before she hurried after her screaming, "You haven't
answered my question!" which only made Ally go faster. "Damn it! I have
right to an answer!" Ling continued, being completely ignored by Ally.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "Let's call Renee and ask." Elaine said as they all had come to a dead
end in their musings. They al agreed and Elaine picked up her phone and
pushed the number to Renee's office. After a short moment Renee answered.</p>

<p>"Renee? Hi it's Elaine." Elaine could hear a sigh as Renee answered.
"Well, we... I wonder if Ally was on a date last night." Elaine listened in
the phone and nodded slightly. "Okay, thanks." she looked up after she
hanged up the phone. "Yes she was on a date last night but not with Ling,
as you thought Richard. She was having a dinner with that representative
and apparently Ling spied on them." Elaine continued.</p>

<p>"Why would Ling spy on Ally when she had dinner with some accountant guy?"
Georgia asked.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a guy." Elaine said with a smile.</p>

<p>"No way she is gay!" Billy exclaimed. Not believing his childhood love
would be gay. His statement resulted in a glare from Georgia.</p>

<p>Before they could continue, Ally stepped out of the elevator with a
screaming Ling right behind her. Not noticing the crowd standing outside
her door she stepped in and closed it right in front of Ling whom
immediately opened it and went in.</p>

<p>"Answer me!" they could hear her scream. "I am not playing with you for
god sake!"</p>

<p>"Please leave my office." Ally replied her lips forming a small straight
line.</p>

<p>Ling looked at her a long moment. "Okay, I'm leaving but this is all your
fault." she accused Ally as she walked out of the room. Ignoring her and
Ally's co-workers.</p>

<p>Ally screamed after her, "Yeah, blame me for everything you BITCH!"</p>

<p>Billy showed a frightened face in Ally's door and looked at her. "Ally is
everything fine?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Yeah, everything's just fine." Ally replied with a sneer. "Ling and I have
just a small disagreement." she continued still wearing an irritated sneer.</p>

<p>"If there is anything me or Georgia can do for you, just tell us ok?"
Billy said intimidated of Ally's mode.</p>

<p>Ally looked at him with a sudden serious face. "Yes you and Georgia can go
and be more with your daughter than be here. She needs you more than the
firm does."</p>

<p>Surprised at her comment Billy simply nodded and disappeared.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "So you mean you're gay?" Tracy asked for the third time.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Ally looked at her irritation fuming out of her ears. "Is it hard
for you to get it or what?"</p>

<p>"Gee, no wonder you have had such problems with guys." Tracy continued
not listening on Ally.</p>

<p>"What?" Ally almost shocked of hearing Tracy's comment.</p>

<p>"Oh... What did you say?" Tracy said shrugging off her thoughts. "So
basically you and this Ling that you told me about a couple of weeks ago
had this big fight and now you're convinced that she hates you?" Tracy
asked looking unsure if she had heard right.</p>

<p>"Basically yes."</p>

<p>"And that is because?"</p>

<p>"She just played with me." Ally blurted out.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes! She made me believe she was in love with me too." Ally explained
irritation filling her like a bottle being filled with fluid.</p>

<p>"Did she tell you right out that she was in love with you?" Tracy asked
already guessing the answer.</p>

<p>"No, but she acted like..." Ally began to answer but was cut of by Tracy.</p>

<p>"Acted like you do when you are in love, right?"</p>

<p>Ally looked down. "Yes." she replied with a barely audible voice.</p>

<p>"Look if you ask her, you will at least know how she feels." Tracy said.
"I would of course prefer to see you both." she added.</p>

<p>"How? She won't even talk to me."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it you who refused to talk to her?"</p>

<p>"Eh... Yeah." Ally blushed.</p>

<p>"Then if I am going to be able to help you, I have to see you both and
talk to you." Tracy said looking at her watch she added, "Well then your
hour has ended. Bring Ling with you for next session."</p>

<p>Ally replied with a weak, "Sure."</p>

<p>After Ally had left the room Tracy took up a Dictaphone. "For later notes,
the main problem with ms. McBeal is her way of not confronting her emotions
with her surroundings, have not decreased as I hoped it would. It is more
likely the opposite. If she is homosexual, maybe coming out will help her
with her real problems."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The office of Cage/Fish and Associates Law firm held a low mode. Everything
seemed to be affected of the agitation existing between Ally and Ling. Ally
did of course not bring Ling with her to her next session with Tracy.
finally Richard and John got tired of their hostility to eachother and
asked them to join them in the conference room.</p>

<p>Ally stepped into the conference room seeing Richard and John sitting
there. She sat down in a chair and asked, "So what do you want to talk
about?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute." was the only reply she got. She noticed how serious they
both were.</p>

<p>After some moments the door opened and Ling walked in. Seeing Ally she
stopped and began to turn but was hindered by Richard.</p>

<p>"We must talk with you two." Richard said as he forced Ling to sit down
beside Ally. Ling surprised at Richard's aggressive mode didn't resist.</p>

<p>"You two will make peace to the extent that it won't affect your job."
John said his voice stern and angry.</p>

<p>"You two have caused us to loose three clients and one potential client."
Richard continued, he also sounded as stern as John had.</p>

<p>"So if you want to work on this firm. You will have to become 'friends'."
John added his face barely moving.</p>

<p>"What? But I." Ally was cut off by Richard.</p>

<p>"Shut up." Richard said. "You two will leave now and not come back until
you have solved what you are fighting about." he continued and pointed at
the door. "I want you to know that we do care about you two but if this
firm is going to survive we can't have you two pushing the mode down to
china."</p>

<p>"By the way Ally. Tracy want's to see you she asked me to tell you that
it is not a good idea to stop seeing once shrink." John said as he looked
after them when they left the room.</p>

<p>"I will." Ally answered blushing, ashamed that Tracy had told John that
she had stopped seeing her.</p>

<p>"You can take my hour to day if you want to."</p>

<p>"Thanks I will." Ally looked at Ling. "She wants to see you too. So why
not come with me?" she added almost afraid Ling would turn her down.</p>

<p>"Guess I have no choice if I want to work here." Ling said with a sulky
tone.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" Richard called as they closed the door.</p>

<p>When they had stepped out of the conference room they stood still waiting
for the other to make a move. Finally Ally broke the silence. "I... I have
to get my stuff first. See you at the elevator?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Ling still seemed to be sulky.</p>

<p>When Ally walked out of her office, Ling stood at the elevator seeming
impatient as she normally was. Her sulkiness gone replaced with her cool
surface.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "I'm not gay!" Ling blurted out for the fifth time.</p>

<p>"You sure made me believe you were in LOVE with me." Ally replied angry
and hurt by what Ling stated.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Tracy screamed to be heard over the two women who were
practically screaming. "You sit down!" she ordered Ling who sat down at the
opposite side of the couch from Ally.</p>

<p>"It's still your fault." Ling muttered looking angrily at Ally.</p>

<p>"Why is it all her fault?" Tracy asked as she looked at Ling with a
serious look.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't dreamt about kissing her, all this wouldn't have happened."
Ling exclaimed exasperated.</p>

<p>"If you had forgotten the dream. We would have been all fine to."</p>

<p>"You are quiet." Tracy said with a stern voice at Ally. She then
continued, "Can you please tell the entire story from the beginning?"</p>

<p>"Okay, it all started..." Ling trailed off telling the entire story with
some interjections by Ally. "... So then she asks Mia out on a date. I
don't know why, but it bugs me. When Mia come to the office I decide to
follow them and eat at the same place as thy do." Ling noticed the look she
got from both Ally and Tracy. "Okay, I decided to spy on you." she
confessed. "Anyway, then they leave the restaurant and go home to her."
Ling nodded in Ally's direction. "I assume they had sex but I don't know
since I didn't stay." she was interrupted by Ally.</p>

<p>"We did not have sex!" Ally looked annoyed at Ling. "She left shortly
after we had drank a cup of tea."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right! You're a sex-monster." Ling replied not believing Ally.</p>

<p>"I'm not a sex-monster!" Ally denied screaming at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling stood up her impatience showing all over her body. "This won't help a
shit." she stated and then left the room.</p>

<p>"Come back here! We're not finished yet!" Ally screamed after her.</p>

<p>Tracy looked at her wristwatch. "Actually Ally, John's time has ended and I
must prepare for my next patient."</p>

<p>"Oh... Okay. I see you on Thursday then." Ally said and gathered hers and
Ling's coats before she left the room.</p>

<p>When Ally had left the room, Tracy opened a drawer and took up Ally's tape.
She put it in the Dictaphone, then noted date and began to talk. "This
person ms. Woo that was with us today seem to be in a serious case of
denial. I would like to have her in private sessions but it seems not as an
option regarding of what kind of personality she has. Hopefully it won't
affect ms. McBeal too much."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Mia sat in her bathtub when the doorbell rang. She thought it was her
sister who forgot her key's again and therefor didn't care to put on a
bathrobe. She walked over to the door and looked out in the peek-glass and
saw Ling standing there. Panicking she grabbed a trenchcoat and hurriedly
put it on herself. "Just wait a moment!" she called out through the door
hoping Ling would wait, knowing how impatient she could be sometimes.</p>

<p>As soon as Mia had opened the door Ling walked in and sat down on the couch
n Mia's livingroom.</p>

<p>"Come in." Mia said not surprised.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Mia and waited for her to follow and sit down beside her.</p>

<p>"So what can I do for you?" Mia asked, curious about what had made Ling
come out here in a late hour.</p>

<p>"I need to talk with you. It's very personal." Ling simply explained.</p>

<p>"Me? Isn't Nelle your best friend?" Mia asked surprised that Ling would
turn to her. They were mostly just friends close but not that close.</p>

<p>"Yes. But this is something I don't think she can help me with." Ling
said not being straight to business anymore.</p>

<p>Mia frowned slightly as she thought what Ling couldn't discuss with Nelle
about. Suddenly realizing what she meant Mia asked, "It's about
homosexuality, right?"</p>

<p>Ling just nodded and blushed making her honey colored skin get a red tone
in them.</p>

<p>"What about it? I thought you knew everything a non gay person can
possibly understand about it."</p>

<p>"Yeah but..." Ling hesitated. Encouraged by Mia she continued, "You have
been in love, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what has that to do with homosexuality?" Mia replied.</p>

<p>"Well, when you was in love you felt... How am I supposed to describe it?
A tingling sensation inside your stomach?" Ling surprisingly unsure of
herself. Completely the opposite of her natural self.</p>

<p>"Yeah... That kind of fits the description, but there are much more too.
Every time different from the other." Mia answered wondering if Ling was in
love with someone.</p>

<p>Ling swallowed hard and then sighed expressing both disappointment and
pleasantness. "So... I'm really in love with her then..." she stated lost
in thoughts about someone.</p>

<p>"Did you say her?" Mia asked now really curious about the person who held
Ling's affection.</p>

<p>Mia's question dragging Ling back to reality, she replied. "It's Ally."</p>

<p>"Oh... I think she is on love with you..." Mia said knowing her hopes now
was really crushed. There was no way she could get Ally interested in her
now. She didn't want to be a soap-opera bitch either and stop them from
being together either.</p>

<p>"I know... Not anymore though." Ling said her voice low.</p>

<p>"Why? Did she say that she didn't love you anymore?"</p>

<p>"No it was me who told her I didn't love her kind of."</p>

<p>"Oh! And that means she stops love you? Just because someone tells you
that she doesn't love you anymore make you stop loving her. Believe me I
know." Mia said with an irritated voice. Tired of Ling's strange behavior.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Mia with regretful eyes. "I'm so sorry. I forgot that Ann
dumped you." she paused a minute. "That was half a year ago. Do you still
love her?" Ling asked looking attentively at Mia.</p>

<p>"Yes. I still do." Mia replied answering Ling's question.</p>

<p>"She was more a bitch than me. Why did you love her at all?" Ling
commented.</p>

<p>Ling looked at the old wall-clock that showed ten past nine. "I must go."
she said as she stood up.</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Well... I want to apologize to Ally and hopefully make up." Ling
explained.</p>

<p>"Okey. Good luck." Mia wished.</p>

<p>"Will you be okay?" Ling asked looking at her friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah... I will just drown my sorrows in a bottle of whiskey and old
romantic movies." Mia replied with a weak smile.</p>

<p>"You could try sleep it off instead." Ling suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, I will need the whiskey as soporific. My sis will put me to bed if
I fall to sleep here on the couch." Mia said her mode decreasing.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should talk to Ally tomorrow." Ling said thinking she should
stay with Mia.</p>

<p>"No! Go now. Tomorrow could be to late." Mia said her voice sounding like
steel. "I said I will be fine. Now go!"</p>

<p>"Okay. See you on Friday then?" Ling asked as she walked towards the
apartment door.</p>

<p>"Yeah we do that." Mia replied.</p>

<p>Ling looked back a final time before she left the apartment feeling
slightly guilty to leave her friend in that state, but knew she couldn't
help her that much anyway.</p>

<p>Ling stood outside of Ally's apartment thinking how she should act. She was
unsure if she should simply walk straight in and declare she was wrong and
Ally was right, or if she should ring the bell and hope Ally would let her
in. As she stood there someone came up behind Ling.</p>

<p>"Hello Ling." the person said the voice angry, making Ling jump like a
scared rabbit.</p>

<p>She turned and saw it was Renee. "Ehm... Hi Renee." Ling replied.
Understanding that Ally had told her best friend everything. "I... I'm here
to apologize to Ally." she managed to explain.</p>

<p>"Really? I whish you luck, but I don't think you will have any." Renee
replied. She looked at Ling with a stern face. "You are serious in apology
to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you will only apologize to her?" Renee continued.</p>

<p>"No. We have other things to discuss to, if she wants to."</p>

<p>"Okay. I'll let you in at least. Maybe all this can be over then."</p>

<p>Ling gave Renee a small smile. "Not over, just changed I hope." she
corrected Renee, making Renee feel a cold shill running down her back.</p>

<p>Ally looked up to see who was coming through the apartment door. She saw
Ling and prepared herself for another fight. Before she could say anything
Ling said, "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Ling walked over to her and hugged her tightly and then said, "I'm so sorry
for hurting you."</p>
