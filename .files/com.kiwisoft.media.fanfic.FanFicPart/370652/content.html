<p>Viola sat in her room, she could hear snippets of the fight down stairs, her parents were yelling at Sebastian, he had just gotten home after Viola had been sprung and forced to get him to come home. Their mother had been really polite and sweet at the airport but as soon as they were back in the house, the yelling had started. Viola and Sebastian's dad had come over also, after being informed as to what his children's summer vacation had consisted of. Sebastian leaving without permission, to another country, skipping school and Viola pretending to be him, to play soccer and make out with an unidentified girl. Mom and Dad really had their hands full.</p>
<p>Viola hung her head in her hands, she knew she should feel bad for her brother, bad for springing him to their parents, even worse for pretending to be him at school, but no matter how much guilt she felt for Sebastian's situation it was nothing compared to how bad she felt for Olivia. Viola pulled her head from her hands, and ran a trembling finger across her lips. The girl could kiss, there was no doubt of that, as Viola sat thinking of Olivia, and what she would give to experience that kiss once more, the fight downstairs worsened.</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything!", yelled Sebastian, he stood up from the interrogating position his parents had put him in, with them standing over him.</p>
<p>"You call running off to London, not doing anything!", yelled Sebastian's Dad, matching his sons anger.</p>
<p>"I was playing my music, something that you don't understand!", yelled Sebastian stepping towards his father.</p>
<p>"You know what, your right I don't understand... I don't understand why I try to give you an education and provide for you and...", said Sebastian's Dad, till Sebastian cut him off.</p>
<p>"Last time I checked you didn't provide for me. Remember your divorced", yelled Sebastian, pointing at both his parents. They looked at each other for sometime, till Sebastian spoke again.</p>
<p>"You know what, forget this", yelled Sebastian storming up to the stairs.</p>
<p>"Honey!', tried his mother.</p>
<p>"Don't, Mom, just don't", yelled Sebastian, he jogged up the stairs to his room, closing the door violently.</p>
<p>Viola sat up, from her new reclining position, the loud thud from down the hall had startled her, she stood up and moved into the hall, looking over at Sebastian's room, and the closed door. Viola opened it casually and strode in.</p>
<p>Sebastian looked up from his packing, he ignored Viola and continued packing.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?", asked Viola worried about Sebastian's intentions, his last escape hadn't gone so well.</p>
<p>"Not even an "I'm sorry"", said Sebastian, dryly.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. What the hell are you doing?", said Viola.</p>
<p>"No one here appreciates me, Vi. I'm getting out", said Sebastian packing more clothes.</p>
<p>"Ah Hello I appreciate you", said Viola.</p>
<p>"Well you have a weird way of showing it", said Sebastian.</p>
<p>"Wait... thats not fair", argued Viola.</p>
<p>"Look Vi this is important to me, and if that girl is important to you then... go get her", said Sebastian with a smile, he slipped a rope out the window, the backpack over his back and disappeared from view.</p>
<p>Viola sat on his bed, thinking whether he had a point, she did like Olivia after all and the carnival incident did reveal something about Olivia, other than her slapping ability.</p>
<p>Sebastian's head popped back up from the window, Viola looked somewhat startled.</p>
<p>"Just don't squeal on me, okay?", said Sebastian glaring at his sister, she nodded and he again slipped out of view.</p>
<p>Viola stood up and walked to her room, grabbing a bag she began to pack an overnight bag. She was going to get Olivia one way or another,Viola decided, throwing in some rope, what ever it took she was ready.</p>
