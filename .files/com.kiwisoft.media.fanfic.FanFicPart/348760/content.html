<p>Seven and B'Elanna were out in the backyard to Dannan's shop, where they had retreated to after the Borg had heard about what happened at the Nokk tavern. Seven had asked a great deal of questions regarding the whole presentation, but also inquired about some very specific details regarding EnNokkia, to B'Elanna's chagrin. Now the Borg was quiet, and B'Elanna couldn't help but wonder what the heck was going through the woman's mind. She didn't want to hope that Seven could be jealous. Edyn and Dannan were still out in the front, probably discussing what was going to happen later that night. </p>
<p>Seven sat on a storage container, and watched as the half-Klingon flexed her limber body to work out the last kinks before her fight tonight. Normally, she would be fascinated by the exhibition, but at the moment, she couldn't help her feelings of nervousness.</p>
<p>"I know this is bothering you, Ani," B'Elanna commented, as she raised her leg high against the wall and bent forward to stretch her hamstrings and calves out.</p>
<p>"What I feel is irrelevant now," Seven answered.</p>
<p>B'Elanna dropped her leg, and walked over to where the blonde sat. "Of course it's relevant," B'Elanna told her, frowning at the negative remark Seven made toward herself.</p>
<p>Seven shook her head, in the most human way.  "No, not now. You must focus on the competition. Regardless of my...feelings...," Seven admitted.  </p>
<p>"I support you completely, Bey. I know you will succeed, for me," she whispered, "and for yourself."  </p>
<p>A little startled, the lieutenant leaned her body against the container next to Seven.  "Wow. Thanks for the vote of confidence," B'Elanna replied, brows raised amazement. No one had ever told her anything like that before.</p>
<p>"You have mine. All of my confidence," Seven whispered, sliding her Borg hand under B'Elanna's, and interlacing their fingers.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked up shyly at Seven from the sight of their hands locked together, and found it difficult to speak with a lump in her throat.         </p>
<p>"You promised we would talk," Seven began. </p>
<p>"Right.... Talk...," B'Elanna murmured. The Klingon's mind was drawing a total blank, and her throat had gone dry. She didn't know why it was so hard.</p>
<p>"But this is not the right time, and you are not ready," Seven concluded, noting the way the lieutenant stopped speaking in full sentences.</p>
<p>Regretfully, the ex-drone released their hands, and stood up stiffly. She walked to the center of the yard and looked back at B'Elanna, hands linked behind her back as usual.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, I should show you some Tsunkatse moves," she suggested, moving her hands and feet into position.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled but eyed her cautiously.  "Are you sure you're up to it, Seven?," she asked, knowing that Seven was not quite fully recovered.</p>
<p>Seven quirked her brow, and beckoned the half-Klingon over.</p>
<p>Her limbs were, unfortunately, not entirely back to normal. The Borg's movements lacked their usual grace and coordination.  Still, B'Elanna was game. It distracted from the difficult conversation ahead of them. B'Elanna pushed herself away from the storage container, and approached Seven's side, taking the same pose. She copied the moves Seven made, and when the ex-drone faltered, B'Elanna was right by her side.</p>
<p>"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea," B'Elanna observed after catching Seven, her arms around the lithe waist.</p>
<p>"I am alright, Bey. You do not need to support me," Seven sighed, questioning why it was easier for B'Elanna to touch her when she was damaged.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she apologized, removing her hands. "Why don't you just tell me what to do, and adjust my moves if you need to?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Seven agreed.</p>
<p>The two women spent the hour practicing, as they hid their feelings behind reassuring touches they gave one another. B'Elanna enjoyed each time Seven corrected her limbs or posture, as it progressed to the point where Seven began embracing her from behind to direct her movements. B'Elanna liked the way Seven took control of her body, or rather, practically commandeered it. She wondered if they could ever do anything together again that wouldn't involve sexual tension between her and Seven, at least from her perception.</p>
<p>But more than that, B'Elanna wanted to love the young Borg, the way she deserved to be loved. She couldn't ignore, however, the rumors she had heard on board Voyager. And if they were true, she didn't want to step in between the Captain and Seven, because she respected Janeway, and because it was wrong. </p>
<p>"Are you paying attention, Bey?" Seven broke her reverie.</p>
<p>"What? Um,...yes. Well, maybe I got a bit distracted." </p>
<p>"I suppose better now than during the tournament," Seven noted dryly.</p>
<p>"Of course. 'Cause I'm going to kick butt tonight," B'Elanna joked, grinning at the ex-drone.</p>
<p>"No doubt you will be magnificent. I look forward to seeing you win."</p>
<p>B'Elanna stopped grinning instantly, and frowned.  "Ani, you're staying at Dannan's tonight," she told her.</p>
<p>Seven's face darkened, but her voice did not raise. "I wish to go with you. You will need...a friendly face in the crowd," she persuaded. "Please do not make me stay behind again."</p>
<p>B'Elanna walked a few steps away, staring off into the crop of nearby buildings. "I won't be able to concentrate if I know you're out there in the crowd watching." She turned to face Seven, and added, "I don't want you to do something impulsive if you think things start looking bad for me. I don't want you to see me..."</p>
<p>"You will not fail. And I will not interfere! I will comply with your commands, but allow me to accompany you," Seven replied with a hint of distress.</p>
<p>B'Elanna crossed over to the Borg, and took hold her arms to comfort her.  "I don't want the tournament to dredge up any bad memories for you. It'll be over quickly, anyway, and I'll be home right after.... Ani, promise me you won't go there."</p>
<p>Seven turned her face away stubbornly. Seven would not allow the lieutenant to place herself in danger without her looking out for the half-Klingon. An idea in her mind clicked.</p>
<p>"You will not see me there," Seven answered dejectedly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pulled the woman to her, wrapping her arms around Seven, and hugged her tightly. She hoped the young Borg would eventually understand. Seven was moved by the spontaneous gesture of affection, and put her own arms around B'Elanna's neck, resting her cheek against the proud brow. She wished the moment would never end, as they held each other. Seven wondered if this was what the Doctor referred to as being in love. If this was, then she was in love with the half-Klingon. They stayed in each other arms for a while longer until Edyn came to get B'Elanna.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>B'Elanna sat on the bench inside the tavern. The fights were being held in the lot behind the structure. Several of the other Houses participating in this moon's tournament had already determined their winners. Edyn was going over some of the rules at the last minute, but for the most part, the fight was a no-holds-barred approach. She had gotten a glimpse of the arena when she first arrived, and it was somewhat intimidating, she had to admit. The pit was only four feet deep to allow the House members and spectators view of the fight. The square arena itself was curtained off tightly with a full line-up of Nokk warriors, each holding a short wooden staff. They kept the fight inside the arena. Outside the pit, tables and benches were filled with spectators, but the far side of the square was reserved for the House that sponsored the particular fight to look on. The area was lit brightly by tall torches that flamed strongly against the mild winds. </p>
<p>The Klingon felt butterflies in her stomach, despite all the reassurances she had received. Even EnNokkia had come by to wish her luck, with Edyn winking at B'Elanna as the young lady bestowed a kiss on her forehead. The lieutenant had been in countless combat situations before, but this was the first time it had held any type of cultural significance for her. Her own House's honor was at stake, as well as her personal pride. To fail was a disgrace, and perhaps, a one way ticket straight to Gre'thor. Surprisingly, to calm herself, she began a Vulcan meditation Tuvok had taught her.</p>
<p>The drumming began outside, signaling the start of the tournament procession. First, the elders of the House of EnNokk would leave the tavern and seat themselves to judge the fight. Then, their champion would follow, and finally B'Elanna would enter as the challenger. The lieutenant stood up, letting her long, belted red jersey hang down to her knees. The fitted jersey was sleeveless, showing off her sleek arms, and its sides were split from her hips down to allow her lower limbs freedom to kick. She wore the black loose-fitting pants that all the warriors wore, but tailored to her size. The crest of the EnNokk House was embroidered in black onto the front of the jersey, and B'Elanna looked at the wondrous design. The triangular shape was made of up sharp, wavy, abstract flames at the three corners that merged and swirled around the center of the design, a circular meander which looped and linked back around itself to where she couldn't see its beginning or its end. Peering at it carefully, the shape seemed to take on a serpentine appearance. Whoever created it must have been a great shaman, or at least a very drugged up one.</p>
<p>Finally, the drum beats changed, indicating it was her turn to present herself in the arena. Edyn was allowed to accompany her to her corner of the pit as a coach and sponsor. Steadily she walked through the doorway of the tavern, trying her best to ignore the quiet gazes from the crowd, and focused her eyes, instead, on the honored family across the pit. She made her way down the ramp to the arena where the line of Nokk warriors parted briefly to allow them both through. She stopped when she met Jae'Nokk, who wore the same crest on his hunter green jersey, and his coach in the center of the square, and they all turned to face the House of EnNokk. B'Elanna saw EnNokkia, who smiled briefly at her favored competitor, sitting to the left of LenNokk. She wore a stunning gown of emerald green, and a black choker with a matching jewel.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Nokk warriors, surrounding the combatants, struck the floor mightily and synchronously with their staffs, and then began an unwavering baritone chant. Edyn winced as his own eardrums vibrated to the sonic pulsations that were emitted. When the chant ended, LenNokk stood and addressed the entire gathering.</p>
<p>"Welcome to our Ritual of the Third Ivory Moon, a celebration of life and honor that has passed from generation to generation among my people. The House of EnNokk extends its hospitality to its guests, so drink well and enjoy the skills of combat to be demonstrated here tonight. Our family presents these two warriors who seek honor for themselves, Jae'Nokk of the House of EnNokk, our champion, and Beylanna, Daughter of Miral of the House of Prasba. Let the tournament begin!" he announced, raising his steel goblet in the air.</p>
<p>The crowd erupted in loud response and applaud, and tipped their glasses to the sponsoring House. The excitement of a new fight swept through the people as they chattered, often arguing among themselves who they thought was going to win. No one noticed a lone cloaked figure that came through the tavern gates, and settled itself at one of the tables overlooking the pit, on the right side. When a small, fat Tarkadian tried to point out that the seat had already been reserved, the figure glared back menacingly. Then smirked as the fat man backed off and scooted even further away down the bench they shared.</p>
<p>B'Elanna went to her respective corner to prepare herself for the coming violence. She bounced up and down on the dirt that covered the arena floor. It was a thick yellow, pasty soil that was seedy more than grainy, preventing it from being used to blind opponents, she supposed. It also would cushion any falls. Edyn looked at the young woman, checking to see if the Klingon was ready. He didn't realize until now how diminutive she seemed compared to her opponent. At 2.25 metros tall (5'5"), he could hardly believe she weighed in at the middle weight class for Nokks. He took the box which he had been handed while waiting in the tavern, as it held the weapons for the first round, and opened it for B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"T-batons...?" B'Elanna questioned as she reached in and took the weapons, one in each hand. </p>
<p>They were solid, blunt instruments that could do a lot of damage. These were heavy, probably made from hardwood covered with black lacquer and polished to a fine finish. She twirled them around to get the feel for their weight and balance.</p>
<p>"Remember, each round is three minutes. Only the first allows weapons, after that they are taken from you. If you are completely disarmed, then you will lose the round," Edyn reminded her.</p>
<p>"Got it," she replied. B'Elanna spun one baton around so that the longer length paralleled her left forearm to block attacks. She would use her right arm, the stronger one, to attack. </p>
<p>The warriors pounded their staffs again, and two Nokk maidens entered the square bringing goblets of wine on their trays. One of the warriors indicated to B'Elanna to down the drink offered to her. B'Elanna threw a questioning glance at Edyn, who shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>LenNokk raised his cup and told the fighters, "Drink the wine of Nokk, the God of our Ivory Moon. May it put fire in your bellies and bravery in your hearts!"</p>
<p>B'Elanna choked down the concoction, noting the way it burned her throat and fell into her stomach like lead. Fortunately, she had a Klingon physiology to lean back on.</p>
<p>"Uh-oh," Edyn murmured nervously, wringing his hands.</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'uh-oh'?" asked B'Elanna, as she wiped her mouth.</p>
<p>"The wine of Nokk is very potent, and I believe you have to down one before each round," Edyn answered, frank concern over his face.</p>
<p>"What? You didn't know I had to drink this stuff?!" demanded B'Elanna as she watched as Edyn was pushed behind the Nokk line-up. The crowd roared as the match was about to begin.</p>
<p>"Yes, well,...this is the first time I've actually done this sort of thing!" Edyn yelled over the heads of the warriors.</p>
<p>"Now you tell me!" B'Elanna growled back, her eyes flashing dangerous with murderous intent.</p>
<p>"Ah, Beylanna behind YOU!"</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned to see Jae'Nokk approach, but not fast enough to dodge the first blow across her face. Neither was she fast enough to avoid the next thrust to her stomach. She staggered away, landing against the wooden wall of staffs which pushed her back into the square arena. Her cheek stung, but she knew the first blow wasn't the cause of her unsteadiness. Everything began to blur as the wine took its effect, and her Klingon physiology wasn't helping. Jae'Nokk curled his lips in contempt, as he observed the way the woman swayed uncontrollably on her feet. Her hands barely held onto her weapons. 'And LenNokk thought this alien was a worthy opponent? How senile could our leader be?'</p>
<p>B'Elanna shook her head to clear it, but her balance remained shaky, and she felt like puking right on the edge of the pit over a couple of boots. Blinking, she saw Jae running up towards her and she swung out to meet him. Their batons cracked loudly together, and the crowd cheered with frenzy as real fighting began. B'Elanna tried hard to defend herself as it rained blow after blow, so she barely had time to strike out offensively. A hit caught her on her elbow, and B'Elanna spun away, trying to shake off the numbness and tingling that traveled down her arm. Jae barreled towards her again with a roar, and B'Elanna hurled the baton at him, end over end like tomahawk, to buy herself some time to recover. Lucky for him, Jae ducked quickly enough, and the baton shot across the arena, and took out one of the other Nokks. The crowd laughed as the warrior fell backwards, knocked out cold, but his presence in the barrier was replaced nonchalantly by another warrior, a female Nokk.</p>
<p>Jae tried to swipe B'Elanna across the face again, but this time B'Elanna blocked it, and slugged him a good right cross in the eye. He dropped back, blinking away the tears, and B'Elanna pressed her advantage even though she was starting to see two of him.  She swung an over-handed blow with her remaining baton in her left hand, but he caught her arm with his own left hand after he discarded a baton aside, and gripped it in an arm lock. His fallen baton was pulled away by one of the Nokk warriors with a staff, and disappeared behind the sea of legs. </p>
<p>Torquing the Klingon's arm outward, Jae pivoted behind B'Elanna and stabbed viciously at her lower back where her kidney laid. B'Elanna screamed in pain as the small blunt end struck her flesh, the nerves in her spine shouting out to her brain. If she had been a full Klingon, her kidneys would have nestled lower in a broader pelvis, protected.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should go back to where you came from, warrior." Jae mocked maliciously, his green eyes blazing. "You deserve nothing from this ritual!"</p>
<p>Jae'Nokk jabbed her again and again, and B'Elanna cried out in frustration as the hurt brought her almost to her knees and the grip kept her immobilized. Gritting her teeth, she crouched low and somersaulted backwards, twisting both their arms and relieving the pressure on hers. Taken by surprise, Jae'Nokk flipped with her to prevent his own elbow from breaking, his grip loosening with the pain, and he landed hard on his backside  B'Elanna stumbled away, supporting the small of her back. </p>
<p>Bending over, she slowed her breathing to control the sharp pangs that still radiated from her injury, and she wondered if she was bleeding internally. The muscles in her back spasmed periodically from the irritated nerves. Time was up when Jae'Nokk flipped to his feet and started another charge at the Klingon. B'Elanna tumbled forward, avoiding the wide swing aimed at her chest, and landed on her feet just as Jae'Nokk passed over her. </p>
<p>"Harrgugh!" Grunting with a vengeance, B'Elanna whipped him hard on his lower back with an audible thud as she stood up, while his momentum took him forward, crashing into the staffs. The crowd had erupted with cheer again when the lieutenant returned the "favor" to the Nokk, but all B'Elanna could hear was the beat of her own heart and the rush of blood in her ears, as her anger grew.</p>
<p>"Paybacks are a bitch," she told him.</p>
<p>Another tall, dark figure entered the back lot of the tavern, just in time to see the vicious exchange occurring in the arena. The figure sat high up on one of the tiered benches that overlooked the left side of the pit, satisfied to see that the expected adversaries were fighting. When it appeared the Klingon was about to lose, the figure rose quickly, tensing. However, the woman warrior had a strong will for survival as well as a competitive spirit, and came back fighting hard. Meanwhile, the cloaked individual at the table noticed the sudden movement out of the corner of an eye, and glanced at the silhouette in recognition. The sight of the shadowy figure brought on unbidden thoughts of punishment due, but for now the focus remained steadfastly on the tournament.</p>
<p>Jae'Nokk turned to face B'Elanna, but he was still clearly reeling from the blow. B'Elanna dragged her feet towards the middle of the ring, as he met her half way. They caught each other's swipes, and grappled back and forth clutching at one another's wrists and rods, snarling at each other.</p>
<p>"Oofffff!" Jae'Nokk grunted. </p>
<p>B'Elanna kicked Jae's right knee out from under him, and his leg smacked against the floor. But he was able to wrench his baton away from the lieutenant, and swept her off her feet with it. B'Elanna rolled away fast, though the wind was knocked out of her, and stood up. Seeing Jae'Nokk run towards her again, she flipped her baton so that she held the straight end, and swung the T-prong to block his attacks. </p>
<p>-Smack!- -SMACK!- -THWACK!-</p>
<p>They traded swings again, as the crowd watched them parry and feint, back and forth across the arena, the dirt kicking up into the air. B'Elanna took another strike against her stomach that pushed her backwards, but she retaliated with straight kick to Jae'Nokk's chin. Her boot cut into the skin of his jaw, and he bled bright red down his neck, staining his jersey.  The Nokk tried a forward thrust to her sternum, but B'Elanna used the opportunity to hook his baton between the T-prong of her stick. With one quick flick of her wrist, she ripped the Nokk's baton out of his grasp, and both adversaries watched as the weapon sailed upwards in a parabolic curve, heading out of the pit. A screen of wooden staffs rose straight up, and blocked the soaring instrument before it could injure a spectator. The baton fell passively to the ground with a dead thump, before it was removed.  </p>
<p>Jae'Nokk recovered from his loss, and kicked the lieutenant's baton out of her hand while she was still distracted. Weaponless, they went at each other with bare-handed hostility, landing a kick on each other's chest and knocking their opponent down simultaneously. When they both hit the ground, the column of warriors pounded their staffs in unison once again, signaling the end of the round.</p>
<p>B'Elanna trod over to her corner of the pit, or at least where she found Edyn waiting for her. He tried to wrap her in a towel, but she pushed him away, too hot and glistening with sweat. He doused her with cool water instead, then wiped her face and arms down, rubbing intently on the muscles to keep them from cramping up. He examined the right side of her face which bore a large, reddened bruise, and compressed the bleeding from her elbow. But she couldn't stand the touch for more than a few seconds, so agitated as she was.</p>
<p>"Beylanna,..." he started, attempting to calm the half-Klingon.</p>
<p>"What?!" she demanded testily, gulping handfuls of water.</p>
<p>"Be careful out there," he replied. "Don't let him get you all riled up."</p>
<p>"Too late for that," she told him, as she paced like a panther trapped in a cage.</p>
<p>Edyn watched in worry, having never seen the young woman so disturbed before. She was not acting like herself at all. Perhaps it was the mixture of the wine, the atmosphere, and what was at stake. Jae'Nokk did nothing to help the situation, as he stared arrogantly from his side of the arena, trying to rally his supporters with the wave of his arm. The Nokk wasn't in great shape himself, after B'Elanna left her mark on his face, which was starting to swell in a few places. The crowd responded uproariously either with cheers or even some jeers, many of them conversing among themselves, no doubt over what had taken place during the first round.</p>
<p>'Stupid idiot,' Edyn reproached the Nokk in his mind, questioning why the ass had been chosen to compete in the first place. 'The blockhead has no sense of honor whatsoever. Now they'll both end up killing each other.'</p>
