<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 33 -->

<p>Placing a quick kiss on Brooke's forehead, Sam reluctantly removed herself from the blonde's warm embrace and headed towards the bathroom. Preparing for another school day, Sam smiled as she thought of the reason why Brooke was allowed to sleep in. </p>
<p>The day had arrived.</p>
<p>Brooke was finally able to remove the sling that had proved to be an annoying hindrance in their more...heated moments. One last check up with the doctor and the blasted thing would be off for good. </p>
<p>An impatient, and sexually frustrated, Sam had commented on more than one occasion that she would dearly love to hold a ceremonial burning for the sling, a sentiment Brooke clearly shared. Yes, today was definitely a day for rejoicing.</p>
<p>Sam entered her room and stopped short at the sight of her bed, coming to the surprising realisation that she hadn't slept in it once since the night she and Brooke had gotten together. That was several weeks ago, and Sam wondered at the good fortune that kept them from getting caught, despite a few heart racing close calls.</p>
<p>The pessimist in her knew it wouldn't last forever, but she quickly pushed that thought aside, not wanting to deal with the consequences she knew were coming once everybody found out about her relationship with Brooke.</p>
<p>Carmen, Lily, Josh and even Nicole knew about them and offered their unconditional support, which meant more to Brooke and Sam than mere words could express. They knew they would need it once everything came out in the open.</p>
<p>Thinking of Harrison, Sam lost her smile and frowned. It had taken a long time for Harrison to overcome his embarrassment and start speaking to her once again. Their friendship hadn't reached the closeness they shared before that disastrous Sunday, Sam understanding it would take time to reach those levels again, if ever. </p>
<p>Harrison did not know that Sam was involved with someone else, and he definitely did not know that Sam was involved with the other girl he had loved since childhood. He would be shattered once he found out, and the recently tentative steps to get their friendship back on track would no doubt be destroyed. </p>
<p>Soon. Sam would tell him soon. </p>
<p>Checking herself one last time in the mirror, and finding her appearance satisfactory, Sam grabbed her bag and headed downstairs into the kitchen. Placing the bag by the foot of the table, Sam switched the radio on and began rummaging through the cupboards, looking for her beloved chocolate pop tarts.</p>
<p>She looked up as she heard footsteps behind her, glaring as Mike walked in, taking a big bite of what looked to be the last pop tart in the house. Knowing how much Sam loved them, Mike had the good grace to drop his head shamefully.</p>
<p>"Sorry Sam, I was running late and didn't have time to make something" Mike said, trying to explain. Inwardly amused, Sam continued to stare at him, crossing her arms and raising her right eyebrow in consternation. Mike shuffled awkwardly and pulled at his shirt collar, discreetly putting distance between them.</p>
<p>"I'll make it up to you. I'll stop after work and get another box, okay?"</p>
<p>Sam considered his offer for a moment. "Make it three boxes."</p>
<p>"Deal. Can I go now?" Mike asked with a slight grin, offering Sam the uneaten half. Sam smiled, accepting it gratefully. Some people needed their daily coffee fix, Sam needed her pop tarts. Heading towards the door, Mike turned around.</p>
<p>"Are we watching Xena again tonight?" he asked, slightly embarrassed at his eager tone. Sam smiled. While she loved the relationship between the two lead characters, Sam speculated that Mike's new found appreciation for Xena had less to do with the love story and more to do with the kick ass fight scenes and the scantily clad women. Not that Sam didn't have an appreciation for those things.</p>
<p>The occasional Xena night provided the chance for Sam to get to know her step father better, which she secretly enjoyed and would never admit out loud, and Brooke and Jane actively encouraged this by declining all invitations to join their little party of two.</p>
<p>"Brooke and I are seeing a movie tonight" Sam replied, noticing his slightly disappointed expression. "How about Sunday night?"</p>
<p>"You're on" he responded with a smile, before adding "Joxer will be in it, right?" Sam rolled her eyes as Mike walked out, his laughter trailing behind him. Humming along with the radio, she poured herself a glass of orange juice and, while waiting for the toast to jump, contented herself with reading the paper.</p>
<p>"Morning sweetie" Jane greeted as she walked in, placing a kiss on Sam's temple. </p>
<p>"Morning, mum."</p>
<p>"Sleep well?" Jane asked, as she prepared the toast the way she knew Sam liked it, and brought it over to the table. </p>
<p>Sam smiled her thanks. "Yeah, not too bad."</p>
<p>"I have to admit I like this new habit of yours" Jane continued, as she sat down beside her. "Of making your bed in the morning. My years of nagging have finally paid off."</p>
<p>Sam chuckled awkwardly. "Well, let it never be said that I don't listen to you. It might take a while, but it does get through eventually."</p>
<p>Jane laughed, before taking a few moments to appraise her daughter. "It's great to see you so happy Sam."</p>
<p>"You're just happy that Brooke and I have finally ceased hostilities" Sam replied, playfully. </p>
<p>"That too" Jane acknowledged with a smile, before reaching over and covering Sam's hand with her own. "Seriously Sam, I..." Jane stopped as her voice failed her, choked with emotion.</p>
<p>"Mum? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Jane, trying to compose herself, responded by simply cupping Sam's cheek and smiled. "I never thought I'd see it again. That light in your eyes." Slightly stunned at her mother's words, Sam didn't respond, unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>"After your father died, it was like somebody had come by and switched you off, and it broke my heart to see you that way because I had no idea how to fix it" Jane explained, her voice wavering with sadness, before smiling brightly. "You've got it back Sam and I can't tell you how much it means for me to see it."</p>
<p>"I'm happy mum" Sam replied simply .</p>
<p>"And that's all I ever want to hear" Jane answered before pulling Sam into a tight hug. Pulling away, she smiled wryly as she wiped away her tears, embarrassed at how emotional she had become. Abruptly changing the subject, she gestured at Sam's half empty glass. "So, how about some more orange juice?"</p>
<p>They glanced at each other and laughed.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Discreetly hiding a yawn behind her hand, Brooke tried her best to drown out Bio Glass' droning. Not for the first time today, she cursed her father's insistence that she head to school after the doctor's appointment, despite her long and passionate speech about her shoulder's first day of freedom from the not so affectionately named, "fucking sling" and how such a positive occasion should be celebrated with a full day off from school.</p>
<p>Her father obviously did not agree.</p>
<p>It wasn't too bad, Brooke decided with a leer, as she glanced at the gorgeous brunette sitting beside her. The enthusiastic greeting she received from Sam, well away from prying eyes of course, more than made up for her dad being a tight ass.</p>
<p>Snapping back to attention, Brooke glanced down and noticed the note Sam had discreetly placed amongst her books. Making sure that Bio Glass was otherwise occupied, Brooke began to read.</p>
<p>"Maintenance shed, lunchtime."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled at the thought, though she couldn't resist teasing Sam a little. Quickly scribbling down her response, she passed the note back. "Wow Sam, you certainly know how to woo a girl."</p>
<p>Sam shot her a look, before passing the note back. Brooke's teasing smirk quickly disappeared as she read Sam's reply. "Okay, if you really don't want to. We can spend lunnchtime with the others."</p>
<p>Brooke glanced at her fearfully, as she quickly handed back the note with her desperate reply. "Maintenance Shed!!! Lunchtime!!!"</p>
<p>Before Sam could wallow in her victory, a dark, towering, luminous shadow appeared by her side, and Sam didn't need to look up to know that it was Bio Glass. The hair standing to attention on the back of her neck, and the shivers of fear running up and down her spine was sufficient enough. Considering the consequences of what eating paper might do to her digestive system, Sam glanced desperately at Brooke who shrugged back helplessly.</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it McPherson" Glass warned, snatching the note from Sam's clutches and reading the lust driven banter. Slowly folding the note and placing it into her coat pocket, her eyes flickered between them, her mouth twitching with amusement. "I see that you both have finally gotten a clue." Sam and Brooke stared at Glass in disbelief, clearly not expecting that response, as the class looked on in confusion.</p>
<p>"You two see me after class" Glass continued, loving the identical expressions of pure astonishment on their faces, before addressing the other students. "Anyone else caught exchanging notes will have the added pleasure of spending time with yours truly for detention."</p>
<p>Once the bell had rung to signal the end of class, and the students had fled the laboratory of hell, Sam and Brooke hesitantly walked towards the front, to find Bio Glass sitting there, staring out the window. She wasn't just staring, she was...Brooke and Sam glanced at each other, surprised. </p>
<p>She was gazing dreamily out the window. </p>
<p>Sam shook her head. That couldn't be right. Gazing? Dreamily? They were so unused to seeing any expression, other than casual indifference or hateful glee, on Bio Glass' face, that they didn't know what to make of this.</p>
<p>"Ms Glass, sir?" Brooke inquired cautiously. "Are you alright?"</p>
<p>"When I was your age, I too found love."</p>
<p>Sam and Brooke looked at each other, bewildered. "Sir?"</p>
<p>"She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen" Glass continued, smiling. Brooke wondered whether her cheeks strained from the effort. "Her name was Olivia."</p>
<p>"What happened?" Sam asked, touched to see a softer, gentler side to their feared, and more than slightly insane biology teacher.</p>
<p>"I stalked her and was slapped with a restraining order."</p>
<p>Sam blinked as Brooke coughed awkwardly. "Thankyou for sharing Ms Glass, sir."</p>
<p>"Your welcome."</p>
<p>Sam shuffled impatiently. They had a maintenance shed to get to. "Are you going to punish us or not?"</p>
<p>"Somewhere you need to be McPherson?" Bio Glass retorted smugly, enjoying the blush covering her students faces. "If anybody asks, you have a 1000 word essay on photosynthesis."</p>
<p>Surprised, but grateful, Sam and Brooke smiled. "Thankyou."</p>
<p>"Don't think for one minute you will escape punishment next time I catch you exchanging sexual invitations" Glass warned them ominously. They glanced at her sheepishly. "Consider this a trade off, a reward if you will, for unintentionally reminding me of my pleasant, treasured memories of my youth."</p>
<p>They glance at her strangely. "Um, your welcome." Bio Glass didn't hear them as she gazed out the window once more, another rare smile on her face. </p>
<p>"That was certainly...interesting" Brooke said, as they left the classroom.</p>
<p>Sam nodded her agreement. "Bio Glass in love. Talk about a foreign concept."</p>
<p>They stopped in the corridor, thinking about it for a moment.</p>
<p>"The shed?" Brooke finally asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, please."</p>
<p>Hurrying out of the building and heading towards the back of the school, Brooke took out a hair pin and expertly jiggled the lock, smiling as she heard it click open.</p>
<p>"You're not just a pretty face" Sam joked, holding the door and quickly heading inside before anyone could see them. </p>
<p>"I have many skills" Brooke replied smugly, laughing as Sam groaned. Placing a chair against the door to prevent anyone from coming in, Brooke turned around to find Sam gazing at her hungrily. Stepping forward, she gently guided Brooke backwards until she was seated, then straddled her lap before bringing their lips together.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Alex stood there, alone and hidden from view, his expression a mix of sadness and anger, as he watched Sam and Brooke disappear into the shed. He couldn't see what they were doing, though his imagination more than made up for his lack of sight. </p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Pulling away slightly to catch their breath, Brooke gazed into Sam's eyes adoringly. "Do you have any idea how much I love you? I don't want to wait any longer Sam." Tightening her hold around her waist, Brooke rested her forehead on Sam's shoulder. "Amend that. I can't wait any longer."</p>
<p>"I know what you mean" Sam replied with an understanding smile, placing a kiss on her head before running her fingers through Brooke's hair. "Believe me."</p>
<p>Brooke glanced up. "Nic has a cabin, about an hours drive from here. How about you and I spend the weekend there?"</p>
<p>"Really?" Sam asked, delighted at the idea. "Do you think the 'rents will let us? It's a bit short notice, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"We'll just say it's so we can get to know each other better, bla bla bla."</p>
<p>"Got this all planned out, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Of course! You, me, the stars. A nice big bed."</p>
<p>"Oooo, I like that." </p>
<p>"It's even got a spa..."</p>
<p>"Oooo, I definitely like that" Sam replied excitedly, making Brooke laugh. </p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Mike opened the door and regarded the visitor with genuine surprise. "Alex?"</p>
<p>"Mr McQueen" Alex greeted. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything?"</p>
<p>Mike stepped aside and gestured for Alex to enter. "No, please come in. I'm afraid Sam isn't here at the moment. She's at the movies."</p>
<p>"That's okay" Alex replied, smiling sadly. "To be honest with you, I'm kind of glad that she isn't."</p>
<p>"What can I do for you then?" Mike asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>"Sam has a couple of my c.ds" Alex explained. "Would you mind if I went and got them? It'll only take a minute."</p>
<p>Mike nodded. "Sure, head on up."</p>
<p>Alex walked into Sam's room and cringed slightly, remembering the last time he had been there and the heated argument which lead to his receiving a black eye, courtesy of Brooke's fist. Who knew she packed such a punch, Alex thought wryly, unconsciously tracing the outline of his brow.</p>
<p>Finally finding what he had been looking for, Alex closed the door quietly and sat down on the bed, skimming quickly through the pages of Sam's diary. He wondered briefly why he was doing this, since he already knew the answer, but that didn't stop him from wanting definite proof, a confirmation.</p>
<p>He needed to know for sure.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Jane looked up and smiled as Alex entered the living room, faltering slightly at the angry expression on his face. "Alex, how are you?" </p>
<p>"I've had better days Ms McQueen" Alex replied, not quite succeeding in keeping the frustration out of his voice.</p>
<p>"I was sorry to hear about your breakup with Sam" Jane offered cautiously, exchanging a concerned look with Mike. </p>
<p>Alex laughed bitterly. "Yeah, well I can't help it if she falls for somebody else."</p>
<p>Jane gazed at him with honest confusion. "Sam is seeing somebody?" Alex didn't reply. "Who is it?"</p>
<p>"I suggest you ask Sam."</p>
<p>"Why would she keep this a secret from me? That doesn't make sense" Jane replied, wondering out loud. She looked at Alex. "I would know if Sam was dating."</p>
<p>"She obviously didn't want you finding out" Alex responded casually, his anger slowly morphing into feelings of vengeance. If Sam wanted Brooke over him, fine. He could handle that. It didn't mean Sam had to have it easy though. </p>
<p>It was her time to hurt.</p>
<p>"Why would she do that?" Jane asked, completely baffled. "What could be so bad about him that she wouldn't tell me?" </p>
<p>Alex laughed. Him. Yeah, right. "Like I said, you should talk to Sam."</p>
<p>Jane glanced at him worriedly before she sat down, her mind racing at the many different scenarios. Was Sam's boyfriend an older man? Was she dating a married man? A bikie? A Mafia boss? Was Sam's boyfriend a pimp? Jane rubbed at her temples as she felt the familiar signs of a migraine coming on. "You must be mistaken Alex. I know you are hurt about what happened between the two of you, but Sam isn't seeing anybody else. In fact, the only person she's been spending most of her time with is..."</p>
<p>Jane stopped, horrified. She glanced at Mike, whose expression mirrored hers.</p>
<p>Oh no. </p>
<p>No no no no no. </p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
