<!-- High School Hell \ A Different Kind Of Therapy -->

<p>Sam sat glaring at the picture on the wall. It was of a ship being tossed on a stormy sea. It was a nicely done painting, Rembrant, she figured, she just didn't want to be there so she wasn't all that interested in it. </p>
<p>"I usually compare that picture to my patients," her therapist, Jennifer, said from her seat a few feet away. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Whatever," she mumbled. </p>
<p>"It represents the battle within them, the storm. But underneath all that turmoil somewhere is the calm they seek, you just have to find it," Jenn explained. </p>
<p>"Again, whatever," Sam said. </p>
<p>"What would you like to talk about, Sam?" Jenn asked. Sam fixed her with a bored stare. </p>
<p>"Technically, I don't want to talk about anything," she responded. "I don't even want to be here." Jenn nodded. </p>
<p>"But your parents thought it would do you some good," she said gently. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Parent," she annunciated. "I only have one, my Mom. Mike is going to be my stepdad and I couldn't give a rat's ass what he thought."</p>
<p>"You don't like him much, do you?" Sam laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>"And to think you wasted all that money on college," she scoffed. </p>
<p>"OK, you don't want to talk about Mike. How about Brooke?" Jenn suggested. Sam arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"What about her?" she asked. Jenn shrugged. </p>
<p>"Well, I met her in a session the other day. Your parents thought therapy might be good for her too. She's a very nice girl and very fond of you, I might add. And very concerned about you too." Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, good for her," Sam muttered. Jenn tilted her head slightly. </p>
<p>"Brooke tells me you two are involved with each other. Are you happy with her?" </p>
<p>"Whatever happened to doctor-patient confidentiality?" Sam shot back. "I don't think you should be telling me what you and Brooke talk about." </p>
<p>"She's extremely worried about you Sam and told me to do whatever I could to reach you," Jenn explained. "She loves you."</p>
<p>"I know," Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"And that bothers you?" Sam sighed again. </p>
<p>"When it causes her the pain it does, yes. She could do so much better than me, I wish she'd realize that." Jenn leaned forward slightly.</p>
<p>"She loves you with all her heart, she told me herself. She wishes you'd see that." </p>
<p>"I do," Sam responded. </p>
<p>"Do you love her?" Jenn asked. Sam looked at her like she was the stupidest person on the planet. </p>
<p>"Are you sure you're a licensed therapist? Of course I do you nitwit! What kind of asinine question is that? Did you get your degree out of a CrackerJack box or what?" </p>
<p>"Sam, there's no need to be insulting, it was merely a question," Jenn protested quietly. </p>
<p>"But insulting is what I do best these days," Sam retorted. "Insulting and angry are my fortes." </p>
<p>"Why do you figure that is?" Sam considered this carefully.</p>
<p>"Because if I wasn't angry and insulting everyone around me I might take the time to actually think about what's happened to me and I might lose what control I actually have left. And I am not about to let that happen."</p>
<p>"Why?" Jenn prodded. Sam smiled without humor.</p>
<p>"Nice try, Jenn. But I'm smarter than that. Oh look, times up. Gotta go." </p>

<p>"Since your individual sessions didn't seem to be doing you any good, Sam," Jenn said two weeks and four headache inducing appointments later, "I thought maybe a joint session with Brooke might be more helpful." Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Whatever," she sighed. (Really, all I want is to be left alone. Why can't anyone see that?) Sam heard Brooke sigh heavily. </p>
<p>"Brooke," Jenn began, "why don't you tell Sam some of what you've been telling me?" (Oh, this is going to suck) Sam knew. </p>
<p>"I'm afraid that she's shutting me out, that she's shutting everyone out and is a danger to herself," Brooke said sadly. </p>
<p>"Oh please," Sam scoffed sarcastically. Brooke frowned at her.</p>
<p>"Well, you are. You said yourself that you've thought about it. You said if you were going to do it you'd slit your wrists. What am I supposed to think, Sammy?" Brooke asked getting upset. </p>
<p>"Think what you want," Sam answered blandly. Brooke folded her arms across her chest and turned to Jenn. </p>
<p>"See what I mean? That's what she does when you try to talk to her. Total shutdown, she could care less." Jenn nodded. </p>
<p>"Sam, are you a danger to yourself?" Jenn asked. Sam resisted the urge to slap the woman. </p>
<p>"Look, I just want to be left alone, OK? Let me sort through this on my own and stop hounding me about sharing my feelings. I'll be fine eventually," Sam said shortly. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"No you won't Sam. We've played this game before and you won't be OK. You'll keep closing yourself off until no one can reach you ever again and I won't let it happen," she said firmly. Sam said nothing but just sat in silence. Brooke sighed and looked at Jenn. </p>
<p>"Sam, what is it you feel you need to sort through? Can you tell Brooke and I how you're feeling?" Jenn asked. Sam shifted uncomfortably in her chair. </p>
<p>"Oh, for crying out loud," she muttered impatiently. "Right now I'm feeling incredibly pissed off," she snapped. </p>
<p>"Sam, that's not what she means," Brooke snapped back. Sam glared at her. </p>
<p>"Fine, you wanna know how I feel? Trapped and scared. There, happy?" She crossed her arms across her chest and waited. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"Trapped and scared? Why?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"Trapped because you won't let me go!" Sam screamed suddenly startling both Brooke and Jenn with the outburst. "And scared because I don't want you to let go." Brooke stared at her in confusion. </p>
<p>"Sam, I don't understand," she said quietly. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"I tried to let you go because I only bring you pain, Brooke, but you held on. I don't want to hurt you and yet that's all that seems to happen," Sam started to explain. </p>
<p>"Sam, you didn't hurt me. Pierce and Becky did the damage this time," Brooke said patiently. </p>
<p>"This time, Brooke. But next time it might be me. This life we've chosen is overflowing with problems. Everything from bigotry to hatred and back and I don't want you to have to go through that. I want you to be happy," Sam said as a few tears streaked down her face. </p>
<p>"Stubborn ass," Brooke sighed without malice only resignation. "I love you, Sammy. You're what makes me happy and to Hell with everything else. I told you that once. Wasn't that enough?" Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"But you're afraid she will let go. Why, Sam?" Jenn asked, reminding both girls she was there. </p>
<p>"Because I don't want to lose her," Sam answered honestly. "I love her too much." </p>
<p>"Than why do you keep pushing me away?" Brooke asked exasperatedly. </p>
<p>"Because I hurt," Sam croaked in a voice that was raw with emotion. "And I just want to be left alone." </p>
<p>"Oh, Sammy," Brooke sighed. "I can't leave you alone because I'm worried about you. I'm losing you within yourself and it scares me." Sam looked at her the expression on her face devoid of hope and full of fear. It shook the foundation of everything Brooke believed in to see that expression on Sam's face. </p>
<p>"Why do you want to be left alone, Sam?" Jenn asked softly. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Because I don't want to hurt anyone else," she answered barely above a whisper. "But that's all I do, hurt the people I care about. Brooke, Mom, everybody. And I can't stand myself anymore." </p>
<p>"Sam, you can't keep blaming yourself for other people's actions," Brooke told her soothingly. "You haven't hurt any of us, at least not directly. You keep shouldering all this responsibility that's beyond your control. You're killing yourself with it." Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Can't help it," she mumbled. </p>
<p>"Sam, you are not responsible for all the bad in the world," Brooke whispered as Sam looked at her pitifully. "Let it go." </p>
<p>"I can't," Sam complained. "I want to but I can't."</p>
<p>"You have to Sam before it destroys you," Brooke told her. "Let go of it and hold on to me. I love you. And even though there's nothing to forgive you for, if that's what you need to hear, Sammy, I forgive you." Sam's face lit up a bit and a small spark returned to her eyes. </p>
<p>"You do?" she asked. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"You did nothing wrong but I do forgive you," Brooke reassured her. Sam smiled at her for the first time in a long time. </p>
<p>"Thank you," she said softly. Jenn looked at the clock.</p>
<p>"As much as I hate to do this, our time is up for today. I think we've made some progress here. Sam, Brooke, do you think you can keep this dialogue going until we meet again?" Brooke nodded. She finally felt like she was getting through to Sam. </p>
<p>"We can try, right Sam?" Sam looked at her with a little hope in her eyes. </p>
<p>"Sure, I guess." </p>
