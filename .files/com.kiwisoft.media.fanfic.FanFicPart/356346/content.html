<!-- About a Girl \ Part 22 -->

<p>"This is a surprise," Katie commented as Jessie came up behind her,  wrapping an arm around her waist lightly before leaning up against a  nearby locker.  "Of the chocolate variety of course."</p>

<p>"Chocolate variety?" Jessie asked watching as Katie loaded up her  backpack with a bunch of books Jessie was quite certain she had no  intention of reading.</p>

<p>"Scrumptious," Katie replied finally closing her locker door and  looking over at Jessie.  "I thought you had your appointment today?"  she said remembering Jessie's dislike for the word `therapy' being  mentioned in the public sphere.  That was one of the things she loved  about Jessie, how real she was.  Most of the kids at school thought  being in therapy and riddled with neurosis's was some sort of badge  of honor, mostly because they'd never had to go through anything that  would make them have to go to therapy thus leaving them with the  delusion that it was somehow romantic.  </p>

<p>"I do," Jessie replied pushing off the locker.  "Just thought I'd  walk you out."</p>

<p>"That's a thought I can definitely get behind," Katie replied with a  small smile following Jessie down the hall.</p>

<p>"So, what'd you do last night?" Jessie asked trying to sound blasé.</p>

<p>Katie sighed shaking her head slightly before responding.  "Sarah  came by.  She stopped me at school yesterday and was all, blah, blah,  blah, regretcakes saying she was sorry about everything."</p>

<p>"And you believed her?" Jessie asked trying fight back the urge to  grab Katie by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.</p>

<p>"Well, she'd certainly eaten her Bitch Flakes with frosting that  morning, but she did seem sorry … and she just looked so pathetic.  I  just couldn't tell her to get lost, it would've been like kicking a  puppy," Katie tried to explain knowing from Jessie's tone that she  was upset, and not really blaming her for being so.</p>

<p>"Well, how was it?" Jessie asked somehow managing not to comment that  Sarah always seemed more like a crazy, rabies infected dog than a  cute little puppy.  She certainly wouldn't have had a problem kicking  her; she probably would've liked it.</p>

<p>"It was alright I guess," Katie responded in a bored tone.  "I mean  it was kinda weird at first, cause I could tell that she was making a  serious effort not to snap at me.  But once we started working it was  okay.  I mean she's so retarded, asking how angles could be obtuse,"  Katie continued her voice a little more animated know.  "I'd  forgotten what a knob she could be.  And then when she went on about  how every episode of Mauray is the same, it was so funny cause it's  like totally true.  It's always either boot camp or children with sad  defects, and…" Katie went on until they exited the building and  Jessie had to go meet her mother.</p>

<p>"Alright, see ya later," Katie said as Jessie opened the door to  Karen's car.  "Hi, Ms. Sammler," she added waving at Karen who smiled  and waved back at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded smiling weakly, then ducking into the car.   If she'd been assaulted by one more verse of Katie's ode to Sarah she  didn't know what she would've done.  God, she loathed that girl.</p>

<p>"Do I look like Gumby?" Jessie bitched at Grace from across the  kitchen table.  "Does my arm look like it's made out of some  incredible stretching material that can zoom across the kitchen and  pick up a bagel so that you don't have to get off your lazy ass?" she  continued crankily swishing her cereal around in the bowl.</p>

<p>"What the hell is your problem?" Grace asked shooting Jessie a look  just as hostile as the other girl's tone.</p>

<p>"Your face," Jessie muttered not even bothering to look up from the  milk in her bowl.</p>

<p>"My face?" Grace asked indignantly.  "My face!?!  What are you still  in kindergarten?  What's next a `yo mamma' joke?" she continued  standing up and moving away from the table.  "No wonder Katie's  hanging out with Sarah again," she said sensing an opportunity to get  back at Jessie and snapping at it like a hungry Panda.  "I'd hardly  want to be around you either," she finished walking out of the  kitchen, not needing to look back to know that her statements had hit  their mark.  Her face indeed.</p>

<p>Jessie glanced up watching Grace exit the kitchen with a frown  marring her fine features, before sighing and going back to her  contemplation of her Corn Pops, Grace's closing words echoing in her  mind.  She'd been obsessing over Sarah and her reemergence into  Katie's life ever since the afternoon Katie couldn't shut up about  her.  She knew without a doubt that Sarah was trying to worm her way  back into Katie's good graces so that she could try and get her away  from Jessie, but Katie for all of her wonderful qualities seemed  completely oblivious to what the other girl was after.  In her  defense, the way Katie treated her hadn't changed in the least, she  was still as doting and attentive as ever, and didn't really seem  inclined to mention Sarah at all unless Jessie herself brought her  up.  But still, there was a little voice nagging Jessie at the back  of her head asking her if Katie was really as oblivious to what Sarah  was doing as she acted.  Making her wonder if Sarah actually had a  chance because she would do anything to get Katie back, while she  herself wasn't willing to do anything to keep her.</p>

<p>Before that night a week ago, they had never actually discussed being  physically intimate.  Like a lot of other things in their  relationship the answer had seemed to be already known to them so  they hadn't needed to talk about it, just like how at the beginning  they hadn't needed to talk about how much affection they would  display in public, they just seemed to understand what the other  would be comfortable with.  But now that they had talked about it,  and Jessie knew for a fact that Katie was ready and was only waiting  on her, she began to be consumed by thoughts of it.  About whether  she was being fair to Katie and their relationship by holding out,  about why she felt the need to hold out even though she often had to  fight herself for control when they got into heavy make-out sessions,  and when the very idea of it made her all tingly inside.  And now  that Sarah had reemerged with her dirty girlfriend stealing hands  pawing wantonly at Katie, who seemed content to just ignore them  instead of patting them off of her, Jessie had begun to think about  it more.  She began to think about taking away the only advantage  Sarah could possibly have over her, and making Katie hers completely.</p>
