<p>A/N: My peoples! I am proud to announce that thanks to all of you, this is my first fic to reach over 100 reviews! And with only eight chapters! Thank you thank you thank you!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Alas, own it, I do not.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"Sup, bro." Viola greeted her roommate as she entered their shared room. Duke was seated at the desk and he glanced at his roommate, currently dressed as Sebastian, as she collapsed on the bed with a dramatic sigh.</p>
<p>"Rough day?" Duke asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think after passing out in class and getting emergency mouth-to-mouth from Eunice?" Sebastian responded with a shudder. Duke snickered at the memory. Twirling his pencil in his hand for a few moments he finally cleared his throat to get Sebastian's attention.</p>
<p>"So, uh.. I heard you mention me to Olivia in class today..." Duke said almost hesitantly. "Did she say anything? About me?" He saw Sebastian stiffen on the bed. She sat up to look Duke in the face apologetically.</p>
<p>"Sorry dude... I don't think its gonna happen between you two." Duke nodded in acknowledgement as he sat back in his chair, pencil tightening in his fist.</p>
<p>"That's okay, man. I wouldn't know what to say to her in the first place."</p>
<p>"Why do you say?" Viola asked curiously. Duke shrugged awkwardly.</p>
<p>"I just can't seem talk to girls." he admitted with a defeated sigh.</p>
<p>"Why, you're hot." Viola said before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I mean, you're an appealing sort of guy, man.. guy man." <i>Me and my big stupid mouth!</i> Viola berated herself.</p>
<p>"Uh... right." Duke turned back to whatever he was working on previously on his desk. Viola stared at his back, feeling compelled to say something to her teammate.</p>
<p>"Do you want to practice talking to girls on me?" she suggested. Duke glanced at Sebastian with a weirded out look.</p>
<p>"Um, no thanks, bro. That would be weird."</p>
<p>"Right. Weird." Viola sighed as if it was obvious. And of course it was obvious! What two self-respecting males would do something like that? And with that Viola fell back onto her small bed, body and mind stressed from keeping up her brother's persona all day. The only time she could feel at ease was when she was with Olivia. She unconsciously smiled as she thought about the blond. Having Olivia in her corner was one of the only things keeping her sane in these crazy times. She just hoped that she wasn't having the opposite effect on her friend.</p>
<p>The sound of the answering machine beeping loudly made Viola jump into a sitting position. Her mother's voice filled the room, much to her annoyance. Her annoyance was soon replaced by panic however, when she realized the subject of her mother's message.</p>
<p>Carnival.</p>
<p>Tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sebastian AND Viola were expected to make an appearance.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>"Huh. I have to go too. I didn't know you were also involved in the debutante business." Duke remarked, glancing over at Sebastian's face, which was frozen in a shocked expression. "Sebastian?"</p>
<p>"OH CRAP! I totally forgot I had to go to that stupid thing!" Viola exclaimed as she jumped up from the bed in panic, only to pause as a loud 'SQUISH' sound filled the room. She didn't dare look down at her feet.</p>
<p>"What the..?" Duke said before his eyes widened when he looked at Sebastian's feet. Or rather what was under his roommate's foot. Viola finally dared to peer down, spotting eight hairy legs sticking out from under her foot. Lots of loud screaming thus ensued from both of them.</p>
<p>To the rest of the residents of the boy's dorm, it sounded like two dudes were "finding nemo" if you get my drift. ;P</p>
<p>Olivia stared at her computer screen, attempting to register what she had just read in her email.</p>
<p><i>Kissing Booth assignments: Olivia Lennox, Viola Hastings</i></p>
<p>"Kissing booth?" Olivia said incredulously. She felt the need to stand up and scream dramatically 'HEAVEN HAS ABANDONED ME!' at the top of her lungs. But, alas, she did not. But it was oh so tempting at this moment.</p>
<p>The events went as follows: A huge tarantula got squashed under Viola's foot. Viola screamed. Duke screamed. Viola tried to scream a bit more manly. Duke sounded like a little girl. Viola proceeded to hop around the room waving her arms around while screaming in a manly fashion (not really). Duke started chasing his roommate to calm him down (while screaming like he just got kicked in the nuts). Viola passed out from fright on Duke's bed. Duke tripped and landed on top of Viola. Andrew and Toby barged in to see what was the matter. Cue awkward silence. Andrew and Toby back out slowly. Duke screams as he realizes what it looks like. Viola starts drooling in her passed-out state. Etc, etc.</p>
<p>After a few more events, in which Duke scrapes the tarantula from the bottom of his roommate's foot while she was unconscious and throws it outside the door and into the hallway, Malcolm happened to be passing by at that moment and spotted his dead accomplice near Sebastian's door. He falls to his knees in front of his one true friend and started crying his eyes out.</p>
<p>"Malvolio! You didn't deserve this fate!" Malcolm cried out in anguish as he pounded the carpet with his fist. He stared hatefully at Sebastian's door. "You'll pay for this, Sebastian Hastings!" He looks back at the remains of his fallen comrade. "I swear it, Malvolio! You'll be avenged! Even if it costs me my life, I will do everythi-" Malcolm's melodramatic speech was cut off when shouts of 'Shut up, Malcolm!' and 'Don't makes us go out there and kick your ass again!' rang out from the doors of various other rooms.</p>
<p>Malcolm sniffed and reluctantly walked away from the dead spider, annoyed that his Revenge Speech was interrupted.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A/N: Yeah, a bit short. But I wanted to keep the carnival part in its own chapter since I plan on making it an important event scene. I'm hoping you guys will actually be surprised at what happens next :) Anyways, review!</p>
