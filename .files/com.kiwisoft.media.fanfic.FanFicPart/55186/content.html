<!-- After Homecoming \ Part 1 -->

<p>"We have a tie. Holly Charleston
and Michelle Blake."</p>

<p>Buffy and Cordelia looked on
in disbelief. After all that work, all that bitching, neither of them had
won. Turning, both girls headed for the door, not needing to hear the two
wannabe's babble some nonsense. They also didn't need to be around the
their friends, it was bad enough that they had saw them lose.</p>

<p>Once out on the street, Cordelia
turned to Buffy exasperated, "Can you believe that?"</p>

<p>Looking up from her dress,
Buffy sighed, "No. I was sure one of us would get it. I didn't even consider
that the other two might win." Buffy started walking towards home, and
Cordelia followed, well aware of the dangers after dark.</p>

<p>"I know, how can Holly win
when she's going out with that loser Jeff. That's way worse than me and
Xander! And Michelle has such bad taste in everything,.well, it was fixed
or something."</p>

<p>Buffy looked sideways at Cordelia,
"I don't doubt it, weren't you the one buying your votes?"</p>

<p>Cordelia stopped walking, "Excuse
me? Just because I have the means, doesn't mean it wasn't fair, and besides
you were the one baking or whatever."</p>

<p>Buffy turned back to where
Cordelia was and smirked, "What about you and your chocolates last year?"</p>

<p>"So? Oh, are you still bitter
because you didn't get one?" Cordelia walked past Buffy, but Buffy didn't
move.</p>

<p>"Cordelia, do you even think
before you say that kind of stuff?" Cordelia stopped in her tracks and
turned around as Buffy continued, "You know, that wasn't one of your finer
moments. Most of the time you're a real bitch,.especially to me. What the
hell did I ever do to you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Buffy."</p>

<p>"Sorry?"</p>

<p>Cordelia sighed, "For being
such a bitch to you last year."</p>

<p>Buffy stared down Cordelia,
"Last year,"</p>

<p>"Okay, and this year too. But
it's not like you've been the nicest person either!" Cordelia walked to
catch up with Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy turned and scoffed. "Hey!
At least I didn't tell half the school I was a freak,or make fun of my
friends in front of everyone,.but never mind. You've changed Cordelia."
Buffy looked at her sideways, "It's like you have feelings or something."</p>

<p>"Alright, enough! I'm a big
bitch, there, now let's drop it." Cordelia turned to Buffy, "Do you wanna
do something tonight? Since we just left the main attraction behind, I
figure it's a little lame to go home this early."</p>

<p>Buffy considered for a moment.
She could go and patrol, but since Giles is slacking, why should she bother?
"Yeah, I guess. Where do you wanna go? I'd offer to go to my place, but
my mom's there and she'd start inquiring as to how the night went,.and
why my dress is wrecked. I don't think I want to go through that tonight."</p>

<p>Cordelia agreed, "Yeah, that
would be major suckage for you. As for me, I'm lucky. My parents are gone
for the week,..so I don't have to deal until they get back, or whenever
they remember to ask. Hey, there's an idea. Do you just wanna come hang
out at my place? Watch a movie or something? I even have some alcohol we
can drown our sorrows in. And you can fix that up." Cordelia pointed to
the small gash on her arm.</p>

<p>Buffy glanced at her arm and
shrugged. "Cordelia, do you remember the last time we both drank alcohol?
Maybe we shouldn't attempt it again."</p>

<p>Cordelia snorted, "Oh please,
we were drugged. Besides, we'd be mixing our own drinks. No harm!"</p>

<p>"Whatever, lead the way."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"I miss my car." Cordelia grumbled
as she unlocks the door and resets the alarm system. "I forgot how far
my house is from the Bronze. That damned limo is to blame. The limo from
hell."</p>

<p>Buffy ignored the other girl
as she takes in the interior. "Cordy, your house is huge. I didn't know
Sunnydale had houses this size."</p>

<p>Cordelia glanced around, "Yeah,
I guess it's big with just me and my parents living here. So, what do you
want to do? Watch a movie? TV? Music?"</p>

<p>"A movie's fine. Whatever takes
the mind off of real life."</p>

<p>Cordelia led the way into the
family room where the entertainment system was. "There's the rack of movies,
pick one out. I'm going to get the liquor."</p>

<p>Throwing in . Heathers', Buffy
settled down on the couch as comfortable as she could get in the dress.
Balancing wine coolers, junk food, and bandages, Cordelia carefully sat
down beside Buffy. "Here, take some of this stuff. I'm starving, I haven't
eaten since,..I don't think I've eaten at all today."</p>

<p>Buffy took the warm cloth and
bandages. "Nervous as I was, huh? I didn't eat either." She confessed as
she wrapped her arm carefully.</p>

<p>Leaning back, Cordelia offered
a wine cooler to Buffy, "Here, I'm sure we can handle these. None of the
hard stuff for us tonight."</p>

<p>"Damn straight."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After . Heathers'was over,
Cordelia threw in . Wild Things'. By the this time they'd each had a couple
of coolers and were feeling them pretty good.</p>

<p>"Do you think the gang wonders
where we are?" Cordy asked, not really caring either way.</p>

<p>"Oh probably," Buffy answered.
"Xander's probably freaking by now."</p>

<p>"Ah, screw Xander. He didn't
even notice I left. There's a lot of things he doesn't notice."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Cordelia, her
attention taken away from the movie, "What do you mean? You and Xander
not working out?"</p>

<p>Cordelia smirked, "We're working
out, if you mean making out. The rest sucks. He's not too attentive past
that point. He really hasn't had a girlfriend before, huh?"</p>

<p>"Unless you count the praying
mantis and the mummy girl? Nope."</p>

<p>Cracking open another cooler,
Cordelia turned her attention back to the movie. The two girls watched
in a drunken haze as Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, and Denise Richards did
their threesome scene.</p>

<p>"I once asked Xander what his
ultimate fantasy was,.he said a two-girl threesome." Cordelia stated, then
smirked, "I'd imagine you'd be one of the girls he'd be thinking of."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Cordelia, "Me?
Why me? You'd be one, but he doesn't want me anymore,..does he?"</p>

<p>"Like, open your eyes Buffy,"
Cordelia spat, "Xander would have you anytime, anywhere, any way,.it pisses
me off."</p>

<p>"Hey, it's not like it's my
fault he liked me,.or still likes me." Buffy said defensively.</p>

<p>Cordelia was silent for a minute.
"Do you even realize how much of a guy magnet you are?"</p>

<p>Buffy laughed, "A guy magnet?
I think not."</p>

<p>"Oh please, I can think of
at least 4 guys you've gotten the attention of since you've come to Sunnydale.
Besides," Cordelia slurred, "You're pretty damned good looking, with a
decent body."</p>

<p>Of course the drunken mumble
came out much louder than Cordelia thought, but she missed the grin on
Buffy's face. "Gee, you mean I actually compare to you, Cordy? Ooh, what
an honour!" Ignoring Cordelia's glare, Buffy pressed, "So, if Xander asked
you to take part in a threesome, would you?"</p>

<p>Cordelia considered for a moment,
"Um, I don't know. I mean, I know Xander so that part's fine, but there's
also someone else,.I'd need to know them I guess."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded drunkenly, "Fair
enough. So what if the other person,.the other girl, was someone you know
already?"</p>

<p>"Like you?"</p>

<p>Buffy laughed, "Sure, how about
me Cordy. Would you DO me?"</p>

<p>Staring at Buffy, Cordelia
was silent. "Yeah, I'd do you. How about you, would you do me?"</p>

<p>Buffy, already losing her train
of thought asked, "In a threesome, or one on one?"</p>

<p>"Well, er,.both I guess. Would
you?" Cordy asked quickly, her self-esteem front and centre.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Buffy slurred,
"Isn't that the same thing? Doing you in a threesome and doing you one
on one? Oh wait,.I'm getting it now,."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. How would I
know if I would like it or not? It's not like I've thought about it." Looking
over at Cordelia, she took note of her fallen expression, "I guess I would."</p>

<p>"Huh? You would?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure. I say you should
experience most things at least once." Buffy shrugged, then added, "Especially
since my lifetime wont exactly be as long as most."</p>

<p>Both girls stared at the TV
screen at a loss for words. Buffy was trying to figure out how they had
gotten to such a conversation, while Cordelia wondered why her tongue was
so loose.</p>

<p>Suddenly Buffy spoke out, "I
don't think I could do Xander."</p>

<p>Startled, Cordelia asked why
not.</p>

<p>"I don't know. There's just
some people you aren't attracted to at all. Well, I am totally not into
Xander for more than a friend."</p>

<p>Cordelia nodded, "I get that.
I've found that sometimes." Chuckling, she said, "Well, so much for Xander's
fantasy, one of the girls wont do him."</p>

<p>Buffy laughed, "Yup, too bad
for him."</p>

<p>There was a few moments of
silence before Cordelia decided to push the conversation further. "Have
you ever kissed a girl before?</p>

<p>Buffy thought for a second,
"Not that I can remember."</p>

<p>"Neither have I. Then again
there's never been anyone to ever . experiment'with."</p>

<p>Buffy straightened up. "What
do you mean? You have lots of friends."</p>

<p>Cordelia rolled her eyes, "Oh
yeah, like Harmony would ever do something that might brand her a lesbian.
Or any of those other sheep." Cordelia looked at the floor for a moment.
"Whatever, it's not important or anything,..I don't know why we even started
this conversation."</p>

<p>Both girls were silent again,
each wondering if the other would speak up first. More coolers were opened
and half drained before Buffy finally spoke up, "Um, is it alright if I
stay here tonight? If I go home drunk, not to mention injured, my mom'll
wig out."</p>

<p>"Sure, I'd be nice to not be
alone."</p>

<p>"Alright, I'm gonna call my
mom then. Where's the phone?"</p>

<p>"In the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Great. I'll be right back
then." Buffy stood up and tried very hard to walk sort of straight towards
the kitchen, only knocking into the wall once. After informing her mother
of where she was and whether she had won Homecoming Queen or not, Buffy
made her way back to the living room. Half sitting, half falling onto the
couch, Buffy moaned, "I am sooo drunk. How are you doing over there Cordy?"</p>

<p>"I'm pretty much smashed too.
Can't quite think straight anymore." Cordelia half-laughed from right beside
Buffy.</p>

<p>"So what do you want to do
now? I don't think I can conjure up the concentration it would take to
watch another movie." Buffy tugged at the broken strap on her dress, "Good
thing I hate this dress, or I'd be pissed that it's wrecked."</p>

<p>Cordelia looked down at her
own dress. "Yeah, it'll take a miracle to clean this thing. Not like there's
anywhere else you can wear this type of dress." Frowning at it, she pulled
at her straps, " I think I'm gonna get out of this thing. And guess I better
get you something to wear to sleep. Come with me upstairs."</p>

<p>Cordelia dragged herself up
into a standing position, then held out her hand to haul Buffy up with
her. The two girls stumbled upstairs to Cordelia's room, where Cordelia
carefully selected pajamas for them to wear.</p>

<p>"The bathroom is over there
for,." Cordy started to say, but Buffy had already pulled her dress over
her head, standing in only her underwear. Shrugging, Cordelia decided to
do the same, numbed to much by alcohol to care about a little thing like
modesty.</p>

<p>After much stumbling and cursing
over balance and buttons, the girls lay on the carpet exhausted. The combination
of alcohol with stress of the entire day had worn them down significantly.</p>

<p>"I can't move my arms and legs.
I think I'll sleep right here." Buffy sighed and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Cordelia rolled over and looked
over at her friend, "Okay, you can do that, and then I can laugh at the
carpet face you'll have in the morning."</p>

<p>Buffy groaned, "Oh, alright.
I wont sleep right here. Where do you suggest?</p>

<p>"I don't care. A bed? That
sounds good. I'm psyching myself up to get up off the floor myself."</p>

<p>With the last bit of Slayer
strength she could muster, Buffy stood up and hauled Cordelia up by her
hands. Stumbling over to the bed, the two girls collapsed once again and
stared at the ceiling.</p>

<p>The night's conversation ran
through Buffy's head, and her mind wandered back to the source of the topic.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the pool scene
in . Wild Things'?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. That was the one on
one action."</p>

<p>"I wonder how comfortable the
actresses were doing that scene,and the other scenes too."</p>

<p>Cordelia pondered for a moment,
"I don't know. They're paid lots of money, so it probably wasn't hard to
get the motivation, plus it's not really that big of a deal to begin with.
They may have wondered what it'd be like anyway."</p>

<p>Buffy grunted her agreement.
"Yeah, that's true. I guess it's kinda natural to be curious." She turned
her head to look at Cordelia, "You're curious, right?"</p>

<p>Cordelia was silent. Buffy
figured she may have passed out, but then Cordelia turned to look at her,
"Maybe. I mean,..I guess I am. Are you?"</p>

<p>Well now I am. All this talk
of it is making me curious,"</p>

<p>Both girls went back to staring
at the ceiling. After a few minutes Buffy finally found her nerve.</p>

<p>"Do you wanna try it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Buffy turned onto her side
and propped her head on her arm. Stifling a yawn, she looked down at Cordelia
who was also near sleep, looking up at her with half closed eyes. Deciding
to act before she lost her nerve, Buffy leaned down and closed her eyes
as she touched her lips lightly to Cordelia's. After a moment she broke
away slightly, waiting to see if Cordelia would want to continue.</p>

<p>Cordelia took the hint well,
and raised her head up a fraction, meeting Buffy's mouth with more pressure
than before. Sliding a hand up into her friend's hair, Cordelia pulled
Buffy down towards her so that she wouldn't have to hold her head off the
bed.</p>

<p>Eventually the kiss deepened,
causing both girls to break away breathless. Buffy rolled onto her back
and licked her bottom lip.</p>

<p>"That was,"</p>

<p>"Nice?" Cordelia offered.</p>

<p>"Nice is a good word for it,
yeah."</p>

<p>Closing her eyes, Cordelia
mumbled her agreement. When nothing was said for a few minutes, she opened
her eyes to find Buffy asleep. A hint of a smile played on her lips as
Cordelia joined her friend in slumber.</p>
