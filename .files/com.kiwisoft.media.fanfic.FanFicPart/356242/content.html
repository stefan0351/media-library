<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Ten -->

<p>Okay so there are a lot of things going on in my life. I have the
entire social hierarchy to worry about at school, I have notes to
take for class and exams to study for and take, I have a relationship...
a really really good relationship with a perfect woman who just makes
everything perfect, and I also have to worry about keeping the entire
city safe, and oh yes there's a woman out there who wants me to be
her special friend in a special way that I'm sure includes torture
and general mayhem. Yeah, I have quite a bit to worry about these
days so I've decided to play a game. It's a special game that only
the very gifted can play and that game is of complete and utter
denial/ indifference. I group these two together only because I'm
indifferent because I'm in denial.</p>
<p>Helena wants me to talk about it so does Barbara and I'm pretty sure
that Reese tried to bring the conversation up, but I don't want to.
It's really as simple as that. What's talking about it going to do
anyway? It'll just be me crying tears over something that I can't
change. I'm way too strong to be crying over spilt milk. That is how
that saying goes, right? It doesn't really matter; I'm not going to
be crying over anything. Well anything having to do with this lizard
person.</p>
<p>Eventually the poisonous lady will come out of whatever sewer or hole
she's buried herself in and will try and do something to me. Well
it's either that or she'll continue to kill all these innocents
because she's searching for something that I can only offer. I think
I rather her just come after me and kill me. After seeing the tenth
body on the ground and knowing...well knowing that I was the cause of
it...well it leaves marks.</p>
<p>What I should do is just go out there and meet her head on. I
shouldn't be hiding behind the protection of Helena, Barbara, and
Reese. I'm strong. I know what I'm doing. I'm not just some little
girl who should be sitting around and doing nothing while my time is
ticking away; because the time is ticking away of that I have no
doubt. I can actually hear the seconds go by and I'm nowhere near a
clock...oh wait scratch that I am sitting in a clock tower, but that's
really not my point. I can hear the seconds ticking away in my head.
My whole body is on countdown.</p>
<p>I need to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get anything
done especially not this history crap. Call me crazy, but I'm not
really that concerned with writing an essay on the effects Woodrow
Wilson's presidency had on this country. I only have one sentence
done so far and I'm not even sure if, 'Woodrow Wilson was a man'
really qualifies as a sentence of any true substance.</p>
<p>"Barbara!" I call as I come out of my room. "I'm going for a walk."</p>
<p>Barbara turns away from her myriad of screens and looks at me like
she's dissecting my simple statement into a million pieces analyzing
it and searching for some hidden meaning. All I meant was that I'm
going for a walk. I can walk. I'm walking right now. What's so hard
about that?</p>
<p>"Helena isn't here," she tells me like I don't know this already. I
know where Helena is. She's out there doing her working thing. Maybe
I should get a job so that I don't have to spend as much time here. I
could certainly try to pay my way a little bit around here. It's
really not necessary for Barbara to pay for everything of mine. I'm
an adult...almost.</p>
<p>"I know, which is just fine because I didn't want to take a walk with
her, I wanted to take a walk by myself."</p>
<p>Okay so here comes the refusal to let me go out because it's too
dangerous and blah blah blah and so on and so forth and the don't you
have homework.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that's what you want to do?"</p>
<p>Alright so she's trying something new here. She's not telling me I
can't do something she's just wondering if I've lost my mind. "Yes. I
can't concentrate on my homework and I need a break."</p>
<p>Okay so now I'm going to get the refusal to let me go out because
it's too dangerous and the blah blah blah's the so on and so forth.</p>
<p>"Keep your comm. set on and if Reese needs something then I'll send
you out. Helena's boss told her if she left early one more time this
week then she's going to get fired."</p>
<p>I think I'm having a scratch head in confusion moment. She wants me
to go and do what now? I can leave? There's no refusal? I was fully
prepared for a refusal. I had my argument all planned out. There was
going to be points to be made and...and there was going to be voices
raised and I was going to storm out of here with conviction. I needed
the anger to override my fear of actually stepping out in the dark
alone. Barbara is a very smart woman.</p>
<p>"Is there a reason for you standing there and staring at me?"</p>
<p>She's smirking at me. I can't believe that she finds this funny. This
isn't funny. This is very serious.</p>
<p>"Dinah?"</p>
<p>I don't know what to say. I can't very well be mean to a person who
is letting me do what I want to do. Where's the authority now?
Where's her, I know best because I've been around longer attitude? I
need this attitude. I can only fight this attitude.</p>
<p>"You do realize that I'm going to go outside all by myself at night?"</p>
<p>"Dinah are you okay?"</p>
<p>"Don't change the subject here, Barb. I want an answer to my
question."</p>
<p>She shakes her head but I guess she is into appeasing me. "I do
realize that it's nighttime and I also realize that you'll be going
out alone."</p>
<p>"Then why am I allowed to go?"</p>
<p>"Because you're old enough to make your own choices and me keeping
you hostage here if you don't want to be here isn't going to make
either of us very happy. Dinah it's your choice to make and your
consequence to live out."</p>
<p>Suddenly I have this picture of the entire 'wax on and wax off' scene
from that one movie. Something's happening here. It's a moment. There
should be some omniscient music playing that just by the tone of it
all should tell me that I'm making some important decision about
life. Maybe I should just say yes sensei, bow, and try and get back
to my pointless paper on a dead man.</p>
<p>"I know that." Wow that's the best I could come up with? "I don't
want to live in fear though. Maybe the consequence of that would be
more damaging to me then something else happening." No that's the
best I can do.</p>
<p>Barbara shrugs. "It's all your choice to make."</p>
<p>Helena wouldn't want me to go out, but she's not here. Barbara isn't
stopping me from going out; she's actually remaining quite neutral.
It's all up to me. This is what I believe some would call pressure.</p>
<p>"Well I'm just going to go out. I won't stay out too long, but I just
need to get away. I feel like I'm suffocating."</p>
<p>"You know Dinah, if you wanted to stay here and actually talk about
what's going on with you then that'd be fine too."</p>
<p>So she doesn't want me to go out! I knew it! She was just playing
with my head.</p>
<p>"Maybe when I get back."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Ah. Fresh air. There's really nothing quite like it. The night has a
little bit of a chill, but I'm not going to let it drive me back
inside. I'm fine. There's no one out here but me and all the other
people walking the streets. They all seem pretty normal, but then
again I guess I look pretty normal too but I'm not really normal. At
least I'm not normal by the mainstream sense of the word.</p>
<p>There was a time when I was younger, as if I'm a hundred now, but
there was a time when I was younger all I wanted to be was normal. I
wanted to be like everyone else around me and fit in because I didn't
want to be left behind again. I didn't want my other mother to leave
me because I wasn't good enough.</p>
<p>I played the role of the good girl for so long that I became her. I
did everything everyone thought I should do; yet I was still a freak.
It didn't matter what clothes I wore or how much I changed how I
acted around everyone else, I was the same freak underneath it all.</p>
<p>Now though, now I wouldn't want to be normal for nothing. If I were
normal then I wouldn't have Helena because I would have never known
she existed. If I were normal then I wouldn't be able to be the
superhero. I wouldn't be able to stick up for the little guy and take
out the bad one. I wouldn't be able to at least try and stop letting
the bullies win. I think they won already too much when it came to me.</p>
<p>"So you finally decided to stop hiding behind your ring of
protectors."</p>
<p>Shit. Shit mother fucking damn. I should have stayed with Barbara. We
could have talked and had a few laughs. It would have been fun. We
could have stayed up and waited for Helena to come home and then we
could do more chatting. Maybe I'd even suggest a nice board game. It
could be the Game of Life and I wouldn't be able to die by playing
it.</p>
<p>I turn around and face this woman who has been my special friend for
the last few months. She's wearing her standard green leather attire
and her eyes are just as reptilian as they've always been. Her long
blonde hair is down and kind of has a winded look to it. Just looking
at her kind of reminds me of looking at myself in the mirror, and
since I'm just noticing this for the first time it's a little
disconcerting. She's not after people that look like me; she's after
people that look like her.</p>
<p>"I can take care of myself." I thought maybe it was time I actually
answer her instead of just stare at her.</p>
<p>"Yes but you still have many protectors. I thought for sure that the
Detective would get in touch with me. He's quite loyal to you."</p>
<p>"He's a good person, which is more than I can say for you." Okay I
need to watch what I say. I shouldn't antagonize the woman who can
spit poison out at me when I don't have the antidote. 'Always
remember the antidote. Always remember the antidote. Even take the
antidote with you when you're just stepping outside for a second' I
believe that's what Helena and Barbara had told me when we were
discussing the antidote.</p>
<p>"Despite what you might think, Black Canary, I am not an evil person.
I want the same thing that everyone else wants."</p>
<p>"Which would be?"</p>
<p>"I want my family."</p>
<p>"So what? You kill people when they decide they don't want to join
you in your life of killing?"</p>
<p>She bows her head and sighs. "I am very misunderstood."</p>
<p>"You kill people maliciously. What's to misunderstand?" Don't
antagonize the evil lady. Don't antagonize the evil lady. I need to
learn that whole self-control thing Barbara keeps on emphasizing when
we're training. I think even Helena brought it up a few times.</p>
<p>"More than you will ever know."</p>
<p>I should bite my tongue. I should bite my tongue and just accept that
she's crazy and then I should try to run away or at least get some
back up here. "Well...how am I supposed to know if you won't tell me?
What are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"I need someone strong enough."</p>
<p>I throw my hands up in the air exasperated. "Not strong enough for
what?"</p>
<p>"You'll find out."</p>
<p>Oh damn. I don't like that look. That's the evil guy death
look. "You'll have to get me first," I choose to run away. I guess I
could stay and fight but all it takes is just a little bit of poison
and I won't be going anywhere for a while.</p>
<p>"Barbara!" I scream. I'm hoping she's heard some of the conversation
already. "I need help."</p>
<p>"Dinah?"</p>
<p>Thank God. "Barbara I need help. I'm uh...well I'm being chased by the
lizard lady and I don't have the antidote to the poison with me."</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll send Helena to your position. Is there anyone else with
her?"</p>
<p>Is there anyone else with her? I don't know. I should know these
things. It's in the hero book written in big letters. Always know who
is around you. Damn it. Well she doesn't appear to be following me.
Why isn't she following me?</p>
<p>Oh wait that's why. It's a trap. "She has a few people with her..." I
stop running and look around me. There's nothing but very high
buildings. If I were Helena I could get the hell out of here and look
forward to looking into the good talking to that Barbara will give me
about not carrying around the antidote and listening to her.</p>
<p>Second rule in the hero book written all big and pretty, 'Don't
Panic'. Okay so I just need to hold on until Helena gets here. I can
take care of the five or so people standing in front of me and the
poison-spitting lady behind me.</p>
<p>"If you come with me willingly nothing will happen to you."</p>
<p>Yes the last time I believed that statement when coming out of the
mouth of the bad guy was...well never.</p>
<p>"Dinah? What's going on?" Barbara sounds a little worried. She can
just join the club.</p>
<p>"Whatever you want you're not getting from me." I rush her. I guess
fighting eminent death is better than being taken away to someplace
else and dying slowly.</p>
<p>She barely is able to dodge my fist but she does. She's quick and
she's ready for a fight. I beat her the last time I can do it again
now. Barbara is screaming in my ear now and it's a little distracting
but I get over it quickly. I can't concentrate on that voice in my
head especially when there's this lady who spits poison out of her
mouth is standing in front of me and some seriously mean looking
people are standing behind me.</p>
<p>I get in a good hit to her ribs with my foot. I actually think I
break a few because I hear a crunching sound. She's knocked down and
I turn around to be faced with a young man that looks like he's going
to be shooting electricity at me sometime soon.</p>
<p>I dive out of the way and don't take the time to make sure I wasn't
hit by the bolt before I'm on my feet again and doing my best to
concentrate on this guy and get him knocked out somehow. I focus on
all my energy and picture him be swept into a wall. Moments later
he's being thrown into the side of the building but it's taken me too
long to do it. I'm being hit in the torso by some type of energy
burst and it hurts like hell.</p>
<p>I'm on the ground and I can feel them all coming closer to me. I put
the pain in the back of my mind and do my best to stand up. I don't
know how much more I can do but I've got to at least fight.</p>
<p>"Don't fight us anymore. I don't want to hurt anyone else." Lizard
lady tells me. "I never wanted to hurt anyone."</p>
<p>Yeah...for some reason, maybe it's the big burn on my stomach, but I
don't believe her. Physically I'm pretty much spent so all I have
left is my meta powers and I may be too weak to even make use of
those.</p>
<p>"Dinah!" Barbara's voice penetrates my thoughts. "Dinah, Sweetie,
hang on Helena is on her way."</p>
<p>Okay so I need to concentrate again. There's four people who appear
to have meta powers ready to kill me. The quickest way to get them
away from me is to uh...well make them go away. I just need to push all
of them away from me. That's not going to be that hard. Sure I've
never done it before, but...okay I need to concentrate.</p>
<p>God. It worked. Wait...some of them are getting back up and I don't
feel too good. "Oracle tell Helena that I'm sorry." I can't fight
anymore. I don't have anything left in me.</p>
<p>Wait what's that? Who's that? Is that Reese? What's he doing here? He
shouldn't be fighting them. He's not strong enough. He'll get hurt
again. I can't hurt him anymore. I like him now. I want to tell him
to watch out for the lady behind him but my mouth isn't working. I
feel like I'm paralyzed. I feel like I'm paralyzed? Did I get hit
with the poison?</p>
<p>It's getting harder to breathe. I think I'm laying on the ground now.
How's Reese doing? I can't see him anymore. I can hear him. I think
Helena's here too. I can almost feel her, but I can't stay awake.</p>
