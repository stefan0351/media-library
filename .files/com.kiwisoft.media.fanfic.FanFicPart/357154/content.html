<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 7: Finding Faith - Part 2-->

<p>It was early morning when Willow and Buffy walked into the library. Just as they had suspected Giles was wide-awake looking through several books. He looked up at them from the table.</P>
<p>"Good morning. It’s rather early." Giles said.</P>
<p>"We both…" Buffy started.</P>
<p>"Couldn’t sleep." Willow finished.</P>
<p>"Faith." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Well it appears your suspicions might have been correct."</P>
<p>Willow smiled.</P>
<p>"See? I knew you were right."</P>
<p>"And if I had time, I’d gloat. She’s not a slayer?"</P>
<p>"She is a slayer. That was confirmed."</P>
<p>"Her Watcher’s not at a retreat, then?"</P>
<p>Giles nodded.</P>
<p>"Then where is he?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"He’s…he’s dead."</P>
<p>Willow drew in a breath.</P>
<p>"Repeat please?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Recently, he was found in Boston murdered. They skimmed over the details, but it was brutal, I was told. The Council lost track of Faith, and they suppose she might’ve been involved."</P>
<p>"That’s not good."</P>
<p>"Shouldn’t we try and find out her side of the story?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"If you can figure out a way of saying, ‘Did you murder your watcher?’ without it resulting in any of our deaths, I’d be glad to hear it, Will."</P>
<p>"Well…why don’t you two go slaying tonight? See what you can find out."</P>
<p>"That’s a good idea. The last thing we need is to alienate ourselves from her, so it would be best to include her in patrol. And for the others safety, do not tell them any of this until we’re sure.</P>
<p>"If they start acting differently around her, she may get suspicious."</P>
<p>"Oh, I can just tell this is going to be a great day." Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"I got in contact with a few of this town’s underground members. They’ll set it up. You just gotta come through." Trick said.</P>
<p>"You don’t doubt me do you, Trick?" Faith asked.</P>
<p>"Girl, don’t get me wrong. I’m all for alliances, whether it be for good, demonic, or indifferent, but only when it’s suits my interests."</P>
<p>"Well that’s good because until this job is done, you’re interests are the boss’ interests. If you’re worried about compensation, don’t worry, the guy’s connected."</P>
<p>"So am I. Poor Kakistos left his little nest just for this game. If he doesn’t get the kill he wants, he’ll be very angry."</P>
<p>"I’ll worry about him."</P>
<p>"Good, cause I’m letting you know now, whether this goes down as planned or not, I’m turning entrepreneur."</P>
<p>"I don’t care what you do. But the boss will."</P>
<p>"He is a mystery. Gotta like a person who wants to keep himself a secret nowadays. Shows class. Guess, I’ll have to wait and see how far reaching he is."</P>
<p>Trick walked away.</P>
<p>"Yes, you will."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>At lunch, the gang was sitting in the cafeteria, absent Buffy.</P>
<p>"She didn’t tell me she was going anywhere. Did she tell you guys?" Willow asked, worried.</P>
<p>"No, but I’m sure she’s fine." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"She’s Buffy. She can handle anything." Xander said.</P>
<p>"I know, but…"</P>
<p>After their ‘secret meeting’ with Giles in the morning, Buffy had been quiet. Then, as soon as bell rang for lunch she had bolted without a word. Willow didn’t know what was going on. </P>
<p>For all she knew, Faith had ambushed her, or was keeping her hostage somewhere, or…</P>
<p><I>‘Stop it. She’s fine.’</P>
<p></I>Willow took a deep breath, and started looking around the cafeteria.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy walked down the sidewalk toward the coffee shop on the corner. Her mom said that’s where Willow’s mom wanted to meet. She was taking a big risk leaving school, but the note her mom wrote excused her off campus for lunch.</P>
<p>She knew Willow was probably going crazy wondering where she was, but she couldn’t tell her. She hoped that Willow’s mom would be reasonable and let Willow come home, or this whole thing would be for nothing.</P>
<p>She saw her sitting at a table. She went over and sat down.</P>
<p>"Thanks for coming."</P>
<p>"Thanks for calling, Mrs. Rosenberg."</P>
<p>A man walked over.</P>
<p>"How is she?" he asked simply. Buffy guessed he was Willow’s dad.</P>
<p>"Bad. She misses you a lot."</P>
<p>"Her dad and I realized we’ve been rash…about this."</P>
<p><I>‘Can you say, understatement?’ </P>
</I><p>"Why don’t you talk to Willow about this?"</P>
<p>"We wanted to meet the person who’s affected our daughter’s life so much, that she’d leave the house, first. I don’t suppose you could stay away from her." She said.</P>
<p>Buffy cringed.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry that was –"</P>
<p>"I’m sure you can understand Buffy, that we take our religious beliefs very seriously, and when my daughter turned against them for you, it was hurtful, to say the least." The man said.</P>
<P>"Mr. Rosenberg, I haven’t tried to purposely undermine your beliefs, and neither has Willow. She’s respects you and loves being Jewish…"</P>
<p>"She’s just never got these kind of thoughts into her head before. Not until –" Miss Rosenberg interrupted.</P>
<p>"Me. Well guess what? I’ve never had these thoughts until her."</P>
<p>The Rosenbergs were quiet.</P>
<p>"Look. I know you’ve probably heard about my record and all that, and to be honest, I have nothing to prove to you that I’m not evil. I can only tell you that I’m a good person, and hope you believe me.</P>
<p>"I would never do anything to hurt your daughter, and I’d make anyone pay who did. She makes me happy, and I hope I do the same for her. Lately though, she’s been really upset."</P>
<p>"I know we’ve been partly responsible," Mrs. Rosenberg said.</P>
<p><I>‘Partly?’</P>
</I><P> 	"But can you understand how uncomfortable this makes us?" she continued.</P>
<p>"I do, and I hate to sound rude, but that’s not the issue. Willow’s happiness is the only thing that matters, and right now, she doesn’t have it. You and your husband are the only ones who can give it back to her.</P>
<p>"I understand that you don’t get it, and it frightens you. We don’t even understand it. We just know we love each other, and that’s good enough for us. She just needs you to be there. You can hate me, or not trust me, but trust Willow.</P>
<p>"She’s knows what she’s doing, and she loves you so much."</P>
<p>"This whole situation is awkward to me. I was raised to believe in conventional things, and I’m not sure how to handle this." Mr. Rosenberg said.</P>
<p>"You believe in love don’t you?"</P>
<p>"Of course I do."</P>
<p>"Then why can’t you let your daughter feel that? Conventional or not?"</P>
<p>"Because it isn’t…natural."</P>
<p>"I’ve learned that a lot of things aren’t natural in this world, but I’m positive one thing is, and always will be. Love; in no matter what form, between whatever gender and type of people, is the purest, most natural thing there is. </P>
<p>"And you can’t contain it, cause love is great and dangerous at the same time. Trust me on that. People will do anything for love. Fight whatever’s in the way. They’re just doing what they think is right. Like Willow is. She isn't intentionally trying to hurt you.</P>
<p>"Sometimes love doesn’t work out, but I have a feeling Willow and I will. She wants this as much as I do. Can't you let us give it a shot?"</P>
<P> 	The two adults were taken aback.</P>
<P>"How do you know you give her that?" He finally asked.</P>
<p>"I don’t. Not for sure. But when I tell her I love her, and she says it back to me, I trust her to tell me the truth. It’s that simple. And I’ve never known her to lie about something as important as love."</P>
<p>"You truly love her don’t you?" He asked.</P>
<p>"Yes, I do."</P>
<p>"You watch out for her?"</P>
<p>"Always. If you didn’t believe anything else I said, believe this. I would never let any harm come to her." Buffy said with conviction. She looked at her watch. "I have to…get back to school."</P>
<p>"Thank you." Mrs. Rosenberg said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>It was the end of school, and the gang was in the library. With Buffy. Faith had come in as well.</P>
<p>"I told you, Will. I went out for lunch." It was technically true, anyway.</P>
<p>"Then how come you didn’t tell me?"</P>
<p>"I was really, really hungry and I didn’t think to mention it?" She offered. Buffy could tell Willow didn’t believe her. "I’ll explain later."</P>
<p>Seeing that that was all she was going to get, Willow gave up.</P>
<p>At the table, Oz and Xander were engaged in meaningless debate.</P>
<p>"Pepe Le Pew was a skunk. His cartoons were pointless! A bucket of white paint falling on a cat and watching her run away from him is funny the first five times, but after that, the joke gets old." Xander said.</P>
<p>"He was a ladies’ skunk."</P>
<p>"The ladies ran away!"</P>
<p>"He was motivated."</P>
<p>"He was a stalker!"</P>
<p>Faith walked up to Giles.</P>
<p>"How do you get anything done?"</P>
<p>"That is a good question. Excuse me."</P>
<p>Giles walked over to the book cage and got out a sword. Walking over to Xander, Giles stood behind the chair he was sitting in, and raised the sword. Silence.</P>
<p>"Works every time." Willow and Buffy said, and started busting up at the sweat dripping down Xander’s forehead.</P>
<p>"Aren’t you going to defend me, Cordy?"</P>
<p>"If I could, Xander, I would. But right now, I can’t think of anything." She said laughing as well.</P>
<p>Xander tried to glare at everyone, but it didn’t work.</P>
<p>"We didn’t mean anything. Really, Xand…" Buffy said, her laughter dying down. "I should patrol. You wanna come Faith?"</P>
<p>"Thought you’d never ask."</P>
<p>They started to walk out, and Buffy glanced back at Willow. Willow gave her a look that said, ‘Be careful’, and watched as Buffy left.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Faith and Buffy ended up in an alley, searching for any signs of vampires.</P>
<p>"Didn't we, um, do this street already?" Faith asked.</P>
<P>"Funny thing about vamps. They'll hit a street even after you've been there. It's like they have no manners."</P>
<P>"You've been doing this the longest."</P>
<P>Buffy gave her a sideways glance, and kept walking.</P>
<P>"So come on, B. Do you play for the other team or what?"</P>
<P>Buffy stopped.</P>
<P>"Okay, Listen F, I’m only gonna say this one last time."</P>
<P>"Do I sense a threat?"</P>
<P>"Maybe. But it ain’t from me." Buffy pointed to the group of vampires coming at them.</P>
<P>She shoved Faith aside as a vampire attacked, making her fall to the ground. Buffy punched the vampire in the gut, and made him land on his back. A second one came and took a swing at Buffy, but she ducked. She blocked his punches and then proceeded to punch him in the face and the gut. She took his head in both hands and twisted. He fell to the ground. </P>
<P>Faith got up and grabbed a nearby trashcan. A third vampire ran in and punched Buffy in the face. He went around behind her and tripped her. She fell. Behind him, Faith smashed the trashcan over his head, blinding him. </P>
<P>She got hold of the can and pushed him into a sheet of drywall. The board broke and fell on top of him, making him fall. One of the others dove for Buffy, but she rolled out of the way and onto her feet. Immediately she crouched down and staked him in the chest. The other one grabbed her from behind and pulled her away. </P>
<P>Faith's opponent got up, and she kicked him in the stomach. He got forced back, and he knocked his head hard into a low pipe behind him. Buffy's attacker threw her onto a stack of plywood. She hit the wall behind it, but got to her feet. The vampire jumped onto the stack and she kicked him in the stomach. He flew back and landed on a dumpster, rolled off, and fell to the ground. </P>
<P>Faith's assailant punched her in the face, but she didn’t feel it She blocked his next two punches and then backhanded him in the face.</P>
<I><P>‘Okay, Faith. Let’s get the plan into action.’</P>
</I><P>"My dead mother hits harder than that!"</P>
<P>"Faith! Stake him and give me a hand."</P>
<P>Faith continued to punch him as he lied on the ground.</P>
<P>"This is me! You undead bastard!"</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Buffy was fighting for her life, trying to get away from two vampires holding her.</P>
<P>"For Kakistos we live! For Kakistos you die!" The vampire told her.</P>
<p><I>‘That was no Oscar performance, but they got the job done. Easy.’</P>
<p></I>"Faith!" Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>Faith grinned and just continued punching.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Faith walked back into the library, and Buffy was still alive, there with her. </P>
<p><I>‘Damn it! I underestimated her.’</P>
</I><p>Buffy stormed past her, and to the rest of the gang.</P>
<p>"Explanation, Faith. Who is Kakistos?"</P>
<p>Giles was suddenly at attention. Before he could speak, Buffy silenced him, and waited for Faith’s explanation.</P>
<p><I>‘I guess I gotta take this to the next level.’</P>
<p></I>Faith looked down at the floor, and started to ‘cry’.</P>
<p>"Who is he Faith?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"An enemy. I came here to try and get away."</P>
<p>"What did he do to you?"</P>
<p>"It’s what I did to him. He…killed my Watcher. So I scarred him."</P>
<p>Buffy walked up to her.</P>
<p>"I... I was there when he did it, and I saw what he did to her... what he was gonna do to me. I tried to stop him, but I... I couldn't. I hurt him, and I ran."</P>
<p>Faith looked at their faces. There was sympathy.</P>
<p><I>‘I’m better than I thought.’</P>
<p></I>They were all in stunned silence. Just as Buffy went to put her hand on her shoulder, she ran.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry. I have to…go."</P>
<p>Faith ran out of the library. Buffy followed her.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>She chased Faith all the way to her motel. When she got in, Faith was packing.</P>
<p>"Where you going?"</P>
<p>"Away from here."</P>
<p>"You can’t keep running."</P>
<p>"Watch me. I haven’t paid the rent yet anyway."</P>
<p>There was a knock at the door. Faith looked out of the peephole. It was the manager.</P>
<p>"See? Told you."</P>
<p>Faith opened the door, and the manager’s body dropped to the ground, revealing a grinning Kakistos.</P>
<p><I>‘Good timing.’</P>
</I><p>"Faith." He said.</P>
<p>She started shaking. Buffy saw the window, and grabbed Faith. They crashed right through it. When they got up off the ground, Buffy was dragging Faith away from a group of very angry vampires.</P>
<p>They ran down an alley, across an intersection, and to a warehouse. Faith glanced back, and saw that Trick was leading the vampires. She grinned. In the corner of the warehouse, there were dead human bodies huddled together.</P>
<p>"No." Faith said.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"This is his place."</P>
<p>"He drove us here."</P>
<p>One of the vampires appeared at an entrance and growled at them. They ran through the warehouse. Two others came in the other side and tried to head them off. Buffy stopped by a bucket, and put her foot in, kicking it into one of the vampire's faces.  He stumbled backward and over a chair. </P>
<P>She kicked the other vampire and did a side kick to another one behind her. He fell backwards over a table. Buffy ran and jumped onto the table, rolled over it and kicked him in the back as he tried to get back up. </P>
<P>Kakistos walked into the building; his gaze was fixed on Faith, but he headed towards Buffy. Buffy rolled to a stand on the table. She picked up a crowbar and swung it at another vampire advancing towards her, hitting it squarely in the neck and knocking her down and out. Buffy saw Kakistos.</P>
<p><I>‘Make it look real.’</P>
<p></I>"Stay away from her!" Faith yelled.</P>
<p>"Faith!" Buffy yelled. She tossed her the crowbar.</P>
<p>Faith caught the crowbar, but before she swung it at Kakistos, he punched her hard and knocked her into a bunch of large wooden beams leaning against the wall. She hit the floor as the beams tumbled down. </P>
<P>Trick walked in, observing the fight. </P>
<P>Buffy started to fight Kakistos, a stake in her hand. Faith was cowering, seeing that Buffy’s back was to her. Buffy roundhouse kicked him in the back of the knee, spun around and tried to backhand him in the face, but he blocked it. She spun around the other way and backhanded him in the face, succeeding. </P>
<p>She then tried to stake him, but with his size, it didn’t even penetrate.</P>
<p>"I guess you need a bigger stake, Slayer!" He said.</P>
<p>Faith, still behind Buffy, picked up a wooden beam and was preparing to shove it through Buffy’s back. Buffy saw her, and thought the wooden beam was for Kakistos, so she helped Faith hold the beam, and they shoved it through his heart. He turned to ash.</P>
<p>Trick was walking away, shaking his head.</P>
<p>"Big picture…they never get it."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, Buffy was in her room with Willow. She was talking on the phone with Giles.</P>
<p>"The Council has approved our request. I informed them of the situation, and Faith is to stay here indefinitely. I'm to look after you both until a new Watcher is assigned." </P>
<p>"Good. She really came through in the end."</P>
<p>"I’m glad to hear it. It’s been a long night. Get some sleep."</P>
<p>"Yes sir. Good night Giles." She hung up.</P>
<p>They heard a knock at the door.</P>
<p>"Who would come here now?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>Buffy shrugged.</P>
<p>"Willow? Could you come down here please?" Joyce called.</P>
<p>Willow looked at Buffy, and Buffy smiled. Willow ran downstairs, and Buffy followed, and sat on the steps. Standing inside the foyer, was Willow’s father.</P>
<p>"Daddy!" She hugged him.</P>
<p>"I’m so sorry. I’ve been a fool."</P>
<p>"What are you saying?"</P>
<p>"I forgot to realize my priorities. As much as have faith in God; I forgot to have faith in my daughter first. I lost it for awhile, but I found it again. With some help."</P>
<p>Willow looked back at Buffy a tear in her eye.</P>
<p>"I should never have made you make a choice between family and someone you love. That was hefty decision I placed on your shoulders, it was wrong of me, and I apologize. It scared me. I thought I was losing sight of who my daughter was, and I panicked. And all it accomplished was hurting you, and I never intended to do that. </P>
<P>"You haven’t changed, you’ve just grown, and I’m sorry it took me so long to realize that. Whatever makes you happy, your mother and I will support it. Forgive me?"</P>
<p>"You know I do."</P>
<p>Willow hugged him again. </P>
<p>"Well, it’s late. You should sleep, and I’ll pick you up here tomorrow."</P>
<p>"Okay dad."</P>
<p>"Make sure to thank Mrs. Summers for her hospitality, and I’ll see you tomorrow. I love you, Willow. Never forget that."</P>
<p>"I love you too."</P>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg looked at Buffy for a moment, smiled, and walked out the door. Willow stood there a moment, and turned to face Buffy. With a huge smile on her face, she ran up the stairs, and hugged her.</P>
<p>"Thank you."</P>
<p>"I’m just glad to see you happy again."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Faith was in her motel room, talking on the phone.</P>
<p>"I couldn’t make the kill…it wasn’t the time…oh, don’t worry. I can play the part of dutiful slayer, but I gotta warn ya, it might drive me crazy…So what’s the next step? Okay…oh no…there’s plenty of possibilities to explore…okay…later boss."</P>
<p>Faith hung up the phone. Tonight didn’t go like she planned, but original plans rarely did. Succeeding in her mission was becoming more important to her. It wasn’t just for the boss; it was for her too.</P>
<p><I>‘I’ll put Miss High and Mighty in her place.’</P>
</I><p>And she thought she had a good place to start.</P>
