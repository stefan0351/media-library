<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 20: Family -->

<P>When Seven of Nine was not amused, it fell heavily on the shoulders of
B’Elanna Torres. At the current moment, B’Elanna felt like there was an elephant
sitting on her back, an unammused, pregnant elephant.</P>
<P>"Why must we wait here?" Seven demanded as she looked around Cargo Bay
two.</P>
<P>"Because," B’Elanna said patiently, "The non-Starfleet components let us put
up a Borg forcefield." She spoke softly, completely calm, and with more
understanding than most would have thought she was capable of displaying. She
knew Seven was more emotional since the pregnancy, so she compensated.</P>
<P>"I understand that," Seven said as she paced. "But why us?" Seven whined
illogically. The exBorg was feeling tired, and more than a little cranky. She
hadn’t spent any time in the cargo bay since their return the day before,
choosing to forgo regeneration until they installed the new system in their
quarters. She hadn’t seen any Borg technology in two and half years, and the
once familiar equipment now made her uncomfortable. She shivered as she stared
at the green glowing console next to her alcove.</P>
<P>"It’s okay," B’Elanna said as she came up behind Seven and wrapped her arms
around her waist. "I know you don’t like it here, love, but hey, I’m a Klingon
warrior. Think I like missing all the fun?"</P>
<P>Seven turned and loosely embraced her wife. "I am being…difficult. I do not
mean to be. My emotions seem to have moved closer to the surface."</P>
<P>"Yeah, but I still love you," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven’s nose. "The
captain just wants to keep us away from the Magistrate. I have to at least
partly agree with her. I don’t want you anywhere near him."</P>
<P>"Yes, but you would like to be there for the meeting…perhaps bring your
bat’tleth?" Seven asked with a smile.</P>
<P>"Well, maybe…" B’Elanna stared down at the floor.</P>
<P>The doors to the cargo bay opened and Neelix leaned around the wall and
peered in. "Hello?" he asked. "Lieutenant? Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Neelix?" B’Elanna asked without letting go of Seven. She was still not
on active duty, and she wasn’t about to miss one second in her wife’s arms.</P>
<P>"Uh, if you’ll drop that Borg forcefield, I have a visitor for you. The
captain thinks this is the safest place." The furry Talaxian was still partially
hidden from view.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked even as she used one hand to disengaged the glowing
green forcefield and kept the other loosely wrapped around B’Elanna’s hip. She
wondered who else on <I>Voyager</I> had to be hidden from the Magistrate.</P>
<P>"Yes," Neelix said with a serious scowl. "Think you could take responsibility
for her?"</P>
<P>"Her?" Seven asked. Her eyes sparkled as she figured out who the visitor
probably was.</P>
<P>Neelix stepped into view, and then tugged Naomi Wildman beside him. </P>
<P>"Hi, Seven." The tiny child looked nervous, she hadn’t seen Seven since her
return and she wasn’t sure how to act around B’Elanna now that they were
married.</P>
<P>"Naomi," Seven yelled and ran toward her. </P>
<P>Naomi’s eyes widened, she had never seen Seven so emotional and she wasn’t
sure how to react. Seven reached her and scooped her up.</P>
<P>"Naomi, I have missed you." Seven kissed the half-Katarian on the cheek
several times and then swung her in her arms. Seven had gotten used to being
openly affectionate with Ty, and that carried over to Naomi, allowing Seven to
show the love she had always felt for the strawberry blonde child. </P>
<P>"Seven?" Naomi squeaked, taken aback by the gregarious hug.</P>
<P>Seven knelt and let Naomi’s feet touch the ground. "I thought about you
often," Seven said with her hands still holding onto the child.</P>
<P>"You did?" Naomi was shocked to see tears at the edges of Seven’s deep blue
eyes.</P>
<P>"I did," Seven said seriously. She noticed Naomi’s confusion so she took a
more familiar approach and stood up to her full height, linked her hands behind
her back and looked down on her with a serious expression. "Naomi Wildman, your
absence from my daily existence was extremely detrimental to my… emotional well
being."</P>
<P>"I missed you too, Seven." Naomi’s eyes brightened and a smile edged up the
corners of her mouth as she tried to remain serious, composed, and yes, somewhat
Borg in her demeanor.</P>
<P>"Well, I’ll be going now," Neelix said, feeling somewhat awkward. He hadn’t
seen that much emotion from Seven since One’s death, and while he liked the way
her obvious excitement to see Naomi made her features even more beautiful, he
wasn’t used to seeing it. "I have a few things to finish up before…our visitors
arrive. Naomi is wearing her arm band, as ordered." He backed out of the cargo,
waving to Naomi.</P>
<P>"Bye, Neelix," she said as she returned the wave.</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said as she watched him leave. She walked over behind
Seven, raising an eyebrow at Naomi and smirking as she remembered a small calf
on Jusari Prime. "Hey," B’Elanna said quietly to Seven," Better get that
forcefield back up."</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said as she turned. She ran her hand over B’Elanna’s arm
as she passed, making the Klingon’s smirk blossom into a smile. "I will collect
our arm bands as well," Seven said as she walked away, her eyes lingering on
B’Elanna’s as she twisted her body to maintain eye contact as long as
possible.</P>
<P>"Hey, squirt, how are you doing?" B’Elanna asked the nervous child.</P>
<P>"Fine, Lieutenant," Naomi replied. "I won’t be any trouble," she added as she
looked around the vast cargo area that was now surrounded by the green glow of
the Borg enhanced forcefield.</P>
<P>"I know that," B’Elanna said as she stepped closer. "Besides, you’re family
now." The Klingon reached down and squeezed Naomi’s shoulder and then bent to
whisper in her ear. "Seven really missed you. You know what she did? She named a
cute little cow after you, and we went out almost everyday to make sure it was
okay."</P>
<P>Naomi said nothing as B’Elanna pulled back, surprised by the revelation about
the cow and the Klingon’s use of the word family.</P>
<P>"You know what she talked about every day while we sat and watched that
little cow?" B’Elanna asked with a half smile.</P>
<P>Naomi slowly shook her head side to side.</P>
<P>B’Elanna bent down onto one knee so that she could look into Naomi’s eyes.
"You. What you might be doing, were you okay, how big were you getting…"</P>
<P>"Really?" A look of wonder covered Naomi’s face, replacing at least some of
the nervousness.</P>
<P>"Yep," B’Elanna assured her. "And we talked about how you were Seven’s
family…how much she missed you…and how, now that she and I are married, that
makes you and I family." B’Elanna saw Naomi’s face crinkle as she processed that
bit of information. "You think you can handle having a Klingon in your
family?"</P>
<P>"Half Klingon," Naomi said with a smile. "Now we have a half Katarian, a half
Borg and a half Klingon."</P>
<P>"Well, that’s quite a mix," B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>Seven joined the two, kneeling down beside B’Elanna without a word. She
carefully attached the bio-dampening band around B’Elanna’s arm, then smiled,
and leaned over to leave a quick kiss on her temple. </P>
<P>"All set," Seven said as she tucked B’Elanna’s long hair behind her ear.</P>
<P>"So, you really are married?" Naomi had just about assimilated the idea of
Seven and B’Elanna being married, but the tender affection she had now witnessed
made it quite real.</P>
<P>"Over two years," Seven said with a wistful smile. </P>
<P>"That okay with you, squirt?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Acceptable," Naomi said with a tiny smirk.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok and three other security officers led the Dengari delegates to the
conference room. Once inside, Tuvok took a seat beside Janeway while his
security team stood around the table, one behind each Dengari delegate. Janeway
was surprised when the Overseer sat next to Malok, her captain of guard,
something else that had been a surprise. The fact that such a high ranking guard
was opposed to his own government spoke volumes.</P>
<P>"Your show of force offends me, Captain," the Magistrate said as he sat
directly across from Janeway.</P>
<P>"I’m surprised that a man of you stature would be so… sensitive," Janeway
said. She was through being nice.</P>
<P>"Where are the prisoners?" he asked as he looked around the table. </P>
<P>"I think Tuvok and I can clear this matter up," the captain responded. She
wasn’t about to let Torres or Seven anywhere near the Magistrate until she was
certain the new charges were dropped.</P>
<P>"They must pay for their insolence," the Magistrate said as he pounded the
desk.</P>
<P>"Insolence?" Janeway asked. "I thought the charge was murder."</P>
<P>"The charges are none of your concern. All that remains to be seen is whether
or not you allow your crewmembers to flee justice." The ridges on his cheeks
reddened, and his hands shook.</P>
<P>"Magistrate, you mustn’t tax yourself," the Overseer said. Her face showed
sincere concern for the man she had only shown fear toward before.</P>
<P>"Justice is a taxing business," he said. "You must learn that before you can
become Magistrate." </P>
<P>"What I’ve seen here so far is not justice," Janeway said. "I’ve seen only a
petty display of power. Your actions are not worthy of the term justice."</P>
<P>The Magistrate stared at Janeway, his face turning deep crimson. The Overseer
reached over and studied him with concern. Janeway watched the interaction
carefully, noting when the Overseer stood and retrieved a pitcher of water that
had been placed on the table for the meeting. She poured him a glass and put it
in his hands, wrapping his fingers around the glass.</P>
<P>"Magistrate, what difference will two prisoners make?" the Overseer asked as
she helped him set the glass down.</P>
<P>"Anarchy," he responded. "Anarchy begins with a single act of leniency. You
must learn that, Overseer." He studied her, and shook his head. </P>
<P>"Magistrate," Janeway began. "You agreed that my people were acting in
self-defense. How is releasing them an act of leniency?"</P>
<P>His face darkened. "They defied my authority by leaving before I had ruled on
the case."</P>
<P>"Father, I released them," the Overseer said as she squeezed his arm.</P>
<P>"Do not address me so informally, Overseer," he yelled and jerked his arm
away. "You will one day hold my position, and these informalities will be your
undoing."</P>
<P>Janeway kept her face absolutely impassive, but it took all of her
self-control. She had known the Dengari were born to their positions, and
apparently the Overseer’s next promotion would make her Magistrate. It hadn’t
occurred to Kathryn that the Magistrate was related to the Overseer.</P>
<P>The Overseer looked down at the table, she sighed and shook her head, then
looked over at the Magistrate, her father; sorrow filled her eyes. "Magistrate,
I will hold your office, and when I do… I will not continue the tyranny of your
rule." Her face revealed what her words did not; she was a daughter who knew
that her father had fostered injustice in his quest for absolute control. She
studied her father and her own face went pale, almost white. It was obvious she
had never stood up to him before.</P>
<P>"You cannot step down," he reminded her.</P>
<P>"I do not intend to," she responded. "But I will not continue to condemn
prisoners to Jusari Prime."</P>
<P>Janeway watched silently. She knew the real issues were unfolding in front of
her.</P>
<P>The Magistrate shook his head. "These two prisoners mean so much to you?" he
asked.</P>
<P>"Not just these two, all of them," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>Janeway watched as the Magistrate considered his daughter’s words. Then she
saw the Overseer glance over at Malok, and saw some of the tall woman’s earlier
color return. Another piece of the puzzle fell into place.</P>
<P>"Well, Overseer," the Magistrate began, "I will allow these two to leave,
free of any charges, but… you must give me your word that you will not close
Jusari Prime. Without it, our space would be overrun by law breakers."</P>
<P>Malok sighed, and rolled his eyes.</P>
<P>"Captain Malok," the Magistrate said dangerously. "Your insubordination is
cause for your own imprisonment."</P>
<P>"Magistrate," the Overseer said softly, then changed her mind, "Father… the
time for Jusari Prime is past. Let our people move on."</P>
<P>"No," the Magistrate yelled as he slammed his fists onto the table. "I am
protecting your birthright. Without my adherence to our…" his voice trailed off
and he clutched his chest.</P>
<P>"Father?" the Overseer was at his side immediately, gently holding his arm as
she knelt beside him.</P>
<P>"Janeway to sick bay, medical emergency in conference room two," the captain
ordered.</P>
<P>"No," the Magistrate rasped. "Beam me back to my own ship."</P>
<P>Malok had moved closer to the stricken Magistrate, and was now standing
directly behind the Overseer. The tall captain of the guard was concerned, and
his hand rested on the Overseer’s shoulder.</P>
<P>Janeway turned to Tuvok, who nodded. "Janeway to the bridge, beam the
Magistrate directly to the Dengari ship."</P>
<P>Janeway felt the ship lurch to one side as she heard phasers impact against
<I>Voyager’s</I> hull. Five well armed Dengari materialized in the conference
room and trained their weapons on Janeway and Tuvok. Dehar, the guard who had
been more than a little interested in Seven, led the group.</P>
<P>"Well done." The Magistrate stood, uninjured. "Take the Overseer and Malok
into custody as well."</P>
<P>"What is the meaning of this?" Janeway demanded. The lights dimmed and the
red panels that lined the room began blinking as the sound of a Red Alert could
be heard echoing through the room.</P>
<P>"The meaning? Captain, you were the one obstructing justice," he said as he
smiled, convinced of his moral and military superiority.</P>
<P>"Father," the Overseer said as two guards moved toward her. "You can’t do
this. Can’t you see it’s wrong." She flinched when Dehar grabbed her
roughly.</P>
<P>"Let go of her," Malok yelled as he broke free from the guards holding his
arm. "She is the Overseer. You will not touch her in that manner."</P>
<P>"Malok, no," the Overseer whispered as Dehar turned his weapon of the former
captain of the guard.</P>
<P>"As I suspected," the Magistrate said with a sneer. "You speak so informally
to your underlings. You are not worthy of your title."</P>
<P>"This is all very interesting," Janeway said as she stood at the end of the
table, flanked by a Dengari guard on each side. "But if you don’t mind… I’d like
you to leave my ship."</P>
<P>The Magistrate laughed, and shook his head. "You have gall, Captain. I will
give you that. Give me the prisoners and I will be on my way." The Magistrate
began examining his fingernails, like he always did when he was feeling
particularly pleased with himself.</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow as he locked eyes with Janeway. "Captain?" he asked,
looking less than amused with the Dengari who had compression riffles trained on
him.</P>
<P>Janeway nodded, then crossed her arms. Her eyes glinted and she almost
smiled. "Waterloo," she said, her voice deep and determined. The Magistrate
stared at her, confused by the word.</P>
<P>The Dengari guards closest to Janeway were suddenly flung back against the
wall and phaser fire erupted from out of no where cutting down the remaining
guards.</P>
<P>The Magistrate watched in stunned silence as his ‘superior’ force was reduced
to a heap of unconscious bodies by some unseen force. Janeway walked over to him
and stood chest to chest with the much taller man.</P>
<P>"You may be a big fish in your little pond, but this isn’t a pond. You’re
swimming with sharks now," she explained with a smile. She turned and spoke
toward the empty area in front of her. "Well done."</P>
<P>Harry Kim suddenly appeared in front of Janeway, or at least his head did.
"Thank you, Captain. These isolation suits really did the trick."</P>
<P>"What is this?" the Magistrate demanded.</P>
<P>Janeway ignored him. "Janeway to Chakotay, report."</P>
<P>"I’m a little busy right now," he said as the sound of phaser fire echoed
behind him. "Condition Gamma White." The comm channel closed.</P>
<P>"All right people," Janeway said to the area behind Harry, whose head seemed
to be floating. "We have a hostile force on board, so we will maintain radio
silence. Let’s move out. Sweep deck by deck until we’re sure every last Dengari
has been found." She looked at Harry’s floating head. "Ensign, I need a hand
phaser." She held out her hand, then pulled it back with the phaser was now
visible.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said as he stepped beside her. "You do not have any
camouflage. It would be prudent for you to stay out of harm’s way."</P>
<P>"My ship has been boarded. I’m not about to hide like a child," she said as
she checked the power cell on her phaser.</P>
<P>"Captain?" the Overseer stepped forward, only to be shoved back by some
unseen force.</P>
<P>"It’s all right," Janeway told the air beside the Overseer. "What is it?"</P>
<P>"Our…his troops are wearing protective armor that absorbs phaser fire. You
have to adjust the settings to compensate," the Overseer explained.</P>
<P>"Treason!" the Magistrate yelled. "You will spend the rest of your…"</P>
<P>"Shut up," Malok said. "Captain, adjust the phasers to a point two seven nine
variance."</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow. "Helpful advice, but somewhat… belated. We have
already adjusted our weapons." </P>
<P>"The scan when we came on board?" Malok asked as he looked down at his own
armor plating.</P>
<P>"Correct," the Vulcan said.</P>
<P>"All right, let’s get these pests off my ship," Janeway said as she felt the
comforting weight of the phaser in her hand. "We need to get to main engineering
and secure operations. Chakotay and I already transferred bridge command to
Engineering."</P>
<P>Tuvok was not amused. Part of the reason he had agreed to allow the dangerous
plan was because he was to personally guard the captain. He had not anticipated
her charging into the fray without regard for her own safety. The Vulcan would
have been embarrassed, if he had been capable of the emotion. Of course Janeway
would fling herself into the fight. She wouldn’t send her crew into anything she
wouldn’t face herself, add to that the fact that the auburn haired captain would
see it as an adventure, and it was inevitable that she lead the charge. He
should have seen it coming.</P>
<P>"Harry," Janeway said, her voice clear and crisp and crackling with intent.
"You and the rest of your team take the lead. Those armbands mask your bio-signs
as well as the suits concealing you. Lay down a suppressing fire as soon as you
see hostile troops, wide beam set for maximum stun. Then let Tuvok and I clean
up while you move on ahead."</P>
<P>"How did you know?" the Magistrate asked as he slumped into a chair by the
table. "I didn’t tell her or Malok. I suspected they sympathized with your
crewmen."</P>
<P>Janeway gave him an almost sympathetic smile. "You don’t like anarchy… I
don’t like to lose." She watched as the arrogant man seemed to shrink into his
chair and his eyes drifted down to the tabletop.</P>
<P>"Captain, let me join you," Malok offered. "I may be able to get some of the
troops to stand down. The Magistrate and his policies are…less than
popular."</P>
<P>Tuvok caught Janeway’s eye and dipped his head a fraction of an inch, but
after spending years together, it was all the communication the two needed.</P>
<P>"All right, Malok," the captain said. "But you’ll have to be unarmed."</P>
<P>"Of course," Malok responded.</P>
<P>"And me," said the Overseer.</P>
<P>"No," Malok said as he spun. "You will stay out of the fighting. It’s too
dangerous."</P>
<P>"I will not," she said defiantly. "My father created this mess…I will help
clean it up." </P>
<P>"You must," Malok said desperately. His eyes brightened and you could almost
hear the wheels in his head turning. "You must see to the Magistrate, and you
must survive so that you can take his place."</P>
<P>"All right," the Overseer agreed. She looked over at he father, surprised to
see him no longer even looking at anyone. She had never seen him surrender so
totally to any situation. "I will stay, but you must be careful, Malok."</P>
<P>"I promise," he said sincerely. He turned toward Janeway. "What now?</P>
<P>"Well," Janeway said as she nodded toward the unconscious men on the floor.
"We finish tying them up, and then we go clean up my ship." She watched the way
Malok interacted with the Overseer, the way his eyes softened when he spoke to
her and how she reacted the same way to him. ‘<I>Ain’t love grand,’</I> she
thought as she went to help Harry secure the prisoners. The dark haired ensign’s
disembodied head was still visible as he worked.</P>
<P>"Ma’am," he said without looking up. "Just about done here… There," he said
triumphantly as he finished securing the unconscious guard. He looked over at
Janeway. "These isolation suits really did the trick, ma’am. Great idea."</P>
<P>"Let’s hold the congratulations until after the ship is secure," she said
quietly. She reached out and tested the knots on the guard’s hands. </P>
<P>"I never thought we’d be using technology from covert sociology for military
application," Harry said conversationally.</P>
<P>"Well, that’s where it came from originally, but they abandoned them because
the lifesigns couldn’t be masked," Janeway said as she moved on to the next
guard to check his restraints. "Now, with the bio-dampeners from the Hanson’s
research, we have a nice little advantage."</P>
<P>"Too bad we only had time to make a few," Harry said.</P>
<P>"Let’s just hope we made enough," Janeway said as she stood. "Harry, as much
as I enjoy seeing your head bobbing around, put that hood back on and let’s move
out."</P>
<P>His head disappeared. "Yes, ma’am," he said in a muffled voice.</P>
