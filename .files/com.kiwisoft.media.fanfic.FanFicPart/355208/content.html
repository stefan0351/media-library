<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ All My Exes Live in Texas -->

<p>"Are we there yet?" Sam asked in an annoying voice similar to
a child's. Brooke smacked her lightly upside the head from the seat beside her. </p>
<p>"Stop that, will you?" she sighed as Sam giggled. Nicole shook
her head from the driver's seat and resisted the urge to just drive them all
into the nearest telephone pole. The constant monotony of the road was finally
starting to drive all four girls a little batty although Nicole figured that was
a short trip in Sam's case. </p>
<p>"The state of Texas welcomes you," Lily chimed in. "Beware of
the Cherry family." </p>
<p>"It doesn't actually say that, does it?" Sam asked as the
welcome sign whizzed past the car and she twisted to try and get a glimpse of
it. Lily laughed. </p>
<p>"No, but it should," she said dryly. Lily REALLY didn't like
Mary Cherry and was glad to be away from her at least. </p>
<p>"Very true," Brooke agreed. </p>
<p>"And to answer your incredibly childish, annoying and
perturbing question, Spam, we'll be there in another day or two," Nicole added.
Sam stuck out her tongue at Nicole in the rearview mirror. Brooke cupped the
sides of Sam's face in her hands and gave her a deep kiss, both because she
wanted to and to stop Sam and Nicole from getting into a fight. Being stuck in a
cramped SUV with Sam and Nicole when they were in the midst of a verbal fracas
was a special sort of Hell on Earth that Brooke liked to avoid whenever
possible. Sam sighed and relaxed against her. </p>
<p>"Mmmm, I like," she purred at Brooke making Brooke smile. </p>
<p>"Hey you two, no fogging up the windows while I'm trying to
drive," Nicole scolded. </p>
<p>"What's the matter, Satan? Jealous?" Sam teased as she ran her
hands through Brooke's blonde hair. Brooke snuggled against her with a happy
sigh. Nicole scrunched her nose in obvious disgust. Really, those two were so
cute it made her stomach turn sometimes. </p>
<p>"Ew, no," she groaned. Lily giggled. "Come on you two, get a
room." </p>
<p>"Hee hee, stop the car and we will," Sam informed her
cheekily. Nicole rolled her eyes and turned to Lily. </p>
<p>"Sex crazed weasels, I'm telling you," she sighed. "On crack." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole loved to watch Lily sleep. The young Latina looked so
innocent and free when asleep. Actually, Lily looked innocent awake but asleep
she looked angelic and content. And Nicole knew that right now, with things as
they were, content was not something Lily felt a lot of the time. Lily didn't
like to talk about it but she missed her home and her other friends. Of course,
Nic didn't understand how anyone could miss Carmen and Harrison but Lily did.
And the loss of Lily's contentment, if nothing else, made Nicole feel guilty. </p>
<p>She watched as Lily shifted slightly and began to snore
softly. It wasn't a snore so much as a heavy sigh, really, and it always served
to make Nicole smile if she was awake. She brushed some hair away from Lily's
face and the corners of Lily's lips curled up slightly into a small smile.
Nicole figured she knew even asleep that she was being watched over. She hoped
that that made Lily feel safe in some way. She'd never let any harm come to Lily
if she could stop it. </p>
<p>It was a habit of Nicole's, watching over Lily as she slept.
Part of it came from disbelief that Lily was even there and the fear that if she
fell asleep, Lily would disappear before she awoke. Although she knew this to be
false, it didn't help to chase away that nagging feeling of inadequacy. She
still felt at times that she didn't deserve Lily on the basis of who she was and
the things that she had done to not only Lily, but also anyone else that had
crossed her path in the past. It was a bitch sometimes, living with the ghost of
who she pretended to be and who she really was. A strange kind of balancing act
that Lily freed her from having to preform and she was immensely grateful for. </p>
<p>Yawning, she slid further beneath the sheets next to Lily and
gently placed her arm over the other girl's hip. She softly kissed the back of
Lily's neck and closed her eyes letting the pattern of Lily's breathing lull
her. </p>
<p>"I love you, Lily," she whispered. </p>
<p>"Love you too," came the groggy and unexpected response.
Nicole smiled and hugged Lily a little tighter before allowing herself to fall
asleep. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Did you call your aunt to let her know we were on the way?"
Sam asked as she ran a brush through Brooke's hair. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, she said that Dad all ready called looking for us but
that we were welcome and she won't call him and rat us out. You were asleep in
the car when I called," she explained. </p>
<p>"Oh," Sam said as she finished with Brooke's hair and nuzzled
her ear. Brooke sighed and relaxed into Sam's arms. </p>
<p>"You take such good care of me, Sammy," she murmured. Sam
wrapped her arms around the thin frame and smiled. </p>
<p>"You deserve to be treated well. I want to give you everything
you deserve and right now, I have nothing to give you," Sam said sadly. Brooke
turned around in Sam's arms to look the brunette in the eyes. The sadness and
guilt she saw there broke her heart. </p>
<p>"Aw, Sammy, all I want, all I need is you," she said. "Give me
that and I'll be happy for life." Sam grinned and kissed Brooke deeply.
</p>
<p>"I'm all ready yours, Brooke." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>After taking a minor detour two days later (or getting lost as
Sam would point out to Nicole who was driving and read the map wrong), they
finally arrived at Brooke's Aunt Terri's house in Austin. She lived in a modest
two-story home and came out to greet the car when it pulled in. She was young
and blonde and closely resembled Brooke's mother Kelly. Brooke got out of the
car and ran to hug her aunt. </p>
<p>"Aunt Terri!" she exclaimed as Terri gave her the mother of
all bear hugs. </p>
<p>"Pumpkin-nose, it has been too long," Terri responded in a
thick Texas drawl. Sam turned to Nicole and Lily and mouthed the words
`pumpkin-nose' with a wide smirk and raised eyebrow. There was something she'd
have to tease Brooke about later. Brooke ushered Terri over to her friends. </p>
<p>"Aunt Terri, these are the friends I was telling you about,"
she started, gesturing towards Nicole and Lily. "This is Nicole and Lily and
this," she said, turning to Sam as the other girls shook hands with her aunt.
"Is?" Terri looked at Sam and grinned. </p>
<p>"You MUST be Brooke's Sammy," Terri finished for her. Sam
nodded in slight shock. </p>
<p>"Uh, yeah," Sam stuttered a little unsure what to say or how
to act at this point. Terri shook her hand and studied her appraisingly. She
then turned to Brooke. </p>
<p>"She's as beautiful as you said she was, Pumpkin-nose," Terri
said happily. Both Sam and Brooke blushed. </p>
<p>"Yes, she is, Aunt Ter. More so even," Brooke said as she
grasped Sam's hand. Sam belatedly realized that Brooke had told Terri about
their relationship and was oddly relieved that there was one less thing to worry
about since Terri seemed OK with it. </p>
<p>"Well, let's get you all inside and settled in and you,
Sammy," she focused on Sam again. "Mean a lot to my Pumpkin-nose. You make her
happy and that's all I care about. But get this straight. Break her heart or
hurt her in anyway and I won't hesitate to take you over my knee and give you a
proper spanking, got that?" Sam smiled as Brooke gasped in embarrassment.
</p>
<p>"I got it Ma'am," Sam answered. "Loud and clear." Terri smiled
again. </p>
<p>"I own a gun too," she added sarcastically. "After all, this
IS Texas." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"So, there goes little Pumpkin-nose, streaking down the main
road in her birthday suit, proud as can be, after the ice cream man," Terri
finished her tale much to the extreme embarrassment of Brooke and amusement of
the others. Brooke sunk down in her chair as Sam roared with laughter.
</p>
<p>"Oh just shoot me," she grumbled. Terri laughed and kept
going, loving her nieces' embarrassment. </p>
<p>"Oh that one, you never could keep a stitch of clothing on her
for the LONGEST time," she informed Sam, Lily and Nicole who were still in
hysterics. Brooke was subtly eyeing the kitchen for an escape route. Or a large
gag for her aunt. Sam was laughing so hard she couldn't speak while Lily and Nic
were now trying to politely hide their giggles for Brooke's sake. It wasn't
working. </p>
<p>"Aunt Ter, please shut up," Brooke begged. Terri saw the
desperate look on Brooke's face and relented. </p>
<p>"All right, no more stories about your childhood for tonight,
Brooke. Why tell stories when I have photos?" Brooke groaned and suddenly wished
that earthquakes were possible in Texas as the other three girls gamely followed
her aunt into the living room. She really wanted the ground to open up and
swallow her. She prayed that her aunt had lost that photo of her in the red
cowboy boots and matching cowboy hat lying on the bearskin run with her bare
butt exposed taken when she was two. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"And here's Pumpkin-nose in her favorite outfit at age two,
red cowboy boots and matching hat. She had a belt with holsters and everything.
That rug is a family heirloom," Terri explained while Brooke tried to suffocate
herself with a couch pillow. She was really wishing she'd stayed in Nevada or
somewhere other than where she was now. Sam was practically physically ill
laughing and Nicole and Lily had given up trying to stifle their laughter long
ago. </p>
<p>"What is that one?" Lily asked pointing to a photo. Brooke
looked over and whined like a wounded puppy. Terri laughed. </p>
<p>"That is little Brooke trying to be Gymnast Barbie," she said
with a snicker. In the photo, Brooke, who was maybe three, was hanging upside
down on a swingset. Her face was bright red and she looked like she was stuck.
And she was, like in most of the photos in this album, naked. Sam hiccuped. </p>
<p>"God, Brooke, could you TRY to keep your clothes on for two
minutes?" she laughed. Brooke shot her a very dirty look. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll remember you said that later," she muttered under
her breath. Sam pouted at her for a second and went back to the photo album. </p>
<p>"You know, Brookie, it's going to be hard to look at you in
quite the same way," Nicole teased, earning herself a dirty look of her own.
"Especially after seeing all these photos of you at your most vulnerable." Lily
dissolved into a new round of giggles as Brooke slammed the book shut and shot
Terri a pleading look. Terri smiled and nodded. </p>
<p>"OK, enough of that for now, I guess," Brooke sighed with
relief at her aunt's words. "We have more important things to discuss anyway.
Like your father, Brooke," Terri said. The mood immediately turned somber. </p>
<p>"Jackass," Sam mumbled. Terri looked at her with a half-smile. </p>
<p>"That's a given, Sammy, but I meant about this. He called here
looking for the four of you. Surprised the Hell out of me given the fact that we
don't talk and never did even when he was married to Kelly." She picked up a
candy from the nearby bowl and proceeded to eat it with flourish. </p>
<p>"Anyway, he called and went on a tirade about Sam corrupting
you, Brooke. And how Nicole and Lily's mothers are looking for them as well.
You're all reported as runaways, by the way." Nicole frowned. </p>
<p>"But we're all over 16 so the police won't touch us," she
argued. Terri nodded. </p>
<p>"In most cases no. But your parents, especially your mother,
Nicole, carry a lot of weight. They're not out looking for you but your parents
are raising a stink back in California." </p>
<p>"I'm not surprised," Nicole said dryly. </p>
<p>"And Mike is livid that you'd pull this Sam and take Brooke
with you," Terri informed the brunette. "He seems to think this was all your
idea. Everything from being gay to leaving L.A." Sam sighed. Again she was
painted as the bad guy and she hated it. </p>
<p>"That's me, evil as Hell," she said bitterly. "I left my horns
and tail in my other pants," she added. </p>
<p>"It was my idea to leave," Lily pointed out. She felt bad that
it seemed like Sam was taking the blame in their absense. </p>
<p>"From what Mike told me, your mother, Lily, and Nicole's
mother are at war with one another," Terri said sadly. Lily winced and shrank in
her chair. There was an ugly visual. Nicole grasped her hand. </p>
<p>"Great," Lily muttered. </p>
<p>"It'll work out," Nicole assured her. Lily spared her a small
smile. </p>
<p>"What about my Mom?" Sam asked hoping for some information on
her mother. She really missed her and wanted to call but she was worried about
whether or not Mike could track them. </p>
<p>"From what I heard of her yelling behind Mike, she's on your
side now and just wants everyone to calm down. And you all to come home."
</p>
<p>"Well, that sounds a little more like my Mom and not that
stranger she'd become," Sam said quietly. Brooke wrapped her arm around her in
comfort and Sam unconsciously leaned into the embrace. </p>
<p>Terri watched the little exchange and saw the obvious love
between the two girls. She could see it between Lily and Nicole too. For the
life of her she couldn't understand how a parent could turn their back on or
disown a child for being gay. To her it was unfathomable. It was still the same
child you gave birth to and raised, and being gay in Terri's opinion and to her
knowledge wasn't a choice. So to her, ostracizing the child for it was just
unfair and showed an overabundance of ignorance on the part of the parent. </p>
<p>That didn't surprise Terri in Mike's case. She never liked the
man and never understood what her sister saw in him. But she loved Brooke and
hated what Kelly had done to the little girl by abandoning her. She knew that
that had scarred Brooke in a lot of ways. She hoped that Sam would be the person
to help Brooke fight those inner demons as well as do battle with Mike.
</p>
<p>"What happens now?" Brooke asked Terri. Terri shrugged.
</p>
<p>"I haven't a clue, really hon. But you four are welcome here
as long as you need a place and want to stay. I promise not to call your parents
or judge you. Who you chose to love is your business. Besides," she added. "Love
is love." All four girls smiled and thanked her. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"I've got a lot a room so you can either have your own rooms
or double up," Terri said with an impish grin later that night that made all
four girls blush. Sam and Brooke took a room upstairs while Lily and Nicole took
a room downstairs. Sam and Brooke settled quietly into the bed. </p>
<p>"I like your aunt," Sam said as she spooned up behind Brooke.
Brooke chuckled lowly. </p>
<p>"I wish she'd stop telling embarrassing stories and showing
those awful photos," Brooke lamented. Sam giggled. </p>
<p>"Oh come on, it wasn't that bad," she said. "Besides, you have
to admit that was some pretty funny imagery. And the photos were hilarious."
Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Sure, have your laugh but if we ever get to go home I'm gonna
pump Mom for stories about your youth. And photos," she threatened
good-naturedly. Sam nuzzled a little closer. </p>
<p>"I miss Mom," Sam said quietly. Brooke turned around so that
they were face to face. </p>
<p>"I know, so do I," she agreed while kissing the end of Sam's
nose. She could see the sorrow in Sam's eyes. She held on a little tighter. </p>
<p>"He can't chase us away forever, Sam," she pointed out. Sam
nodded. </p>
<p>"I hope not." Brooke stared intently at her. She knew that in
the face of missing her mother, Sam needed her to be strong. And she was happy
to be able to do that. </p>
<p>"He won't, Sam. We WILL go home," she vowed. "And maybe until
then Ter can help us find a way to call Mom," she suggested. Sam's face lit up. </p>
<p>"You think so?" she asked hopefully. Brooke brushed some hair
away from Sam's face. </p>
<p>"We can try, Sam. Besides, I'm worried about her too.
Tomorrow?" </p>
<p>"Tomorrow," Sam agreed happily. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Oh, I needed that laugh, Niki," Lily said as she leaned
against Nicole in the bed. Nicole wrapped her arms around Lily and rested her
head on top of Lily's hair. </p>
<p>"Me too. Who'd have thought B was such a closet
exhibitionist?" she joked. Lily giggled. </p>
<p>"I especially liked the one where she was in the bathtub with
the dog trying to wash its hair with a bar of soap," Lily said with a chuckle.
Nicole laughed. </p>
<p>"I definitely have to steal some before we go home," she said.
Lily tilted her head up to look at her with a raised brow. Nicole caught the
look and shrugged. </p>
<p>"Not to use against her at school with, Lil. Just to torture
her privately with. I swear," she pouted. Lily leaned up and kissed her.
</p>
<p>"I believe you," she whispered. "I'm tired." </p>
<p>"Then go to sleep, Lily. Good night, I'll still be here in the
morning," Nicole promised. Lily smiled sleepily. </p>
<p>"Promise?" she joked. </p>
<p>"I do." </p>
