<!-- School Daze \ Part 2 -->

<p>They were beating him and beating him. They kept beating him till he
fell down. </p>

<p>But they picked him back up again.</p>

<p>Her Daddy's eyes were looking at her. He was crying.</p>

<p>Please Daddy don't cry. Please stop hitting my Daddy.</p>

<p>I sucked in a deep breath as I woke from another dream. I hated how
this shit made me feel. Every time I woke up it was like I was that
little girl again and I was helpless and small. I wiped a hand across
my eyes, trying to get rid of the last bits of clinging sleep when I
heard the yelling. It was muffled cause of the walls but it was still
loud enough that I could make out some words. I recognized one of the
voices as Mrs. Summers. Maybe the dream wasn't what woke me up this
time.</p>

<p>After Buffy had convinced me that it was a better idea to go home in
the morning, she'd insisted that I sleep on the bed with her and when
I asked why, she'd told me cause it reminded her of the slumber
parties she had as a kid. So, here I am, in Buffy Summers' bed and
her parents, at least I think that's her father, are having a fight
downstairs. Turning my head to the right, I saw that Buffy had her
back to me. She was all curled up. One of her hands was covering her
ear and she was so tense that there's no way she could've been
asleep. </p>

<p>I wasn't sure how to handle it. Did I try and comfort her or would
that just make her more uncomfortable? Should I just leave her alone
and pretend like I'm still asleep? I hadn't known the girl that long.
I didn't know how she'd react.</p>

<p>But as I kept staring at her back, I knew I had to help and justpray
that I wasn't making the whole situation worse. I turned my body so I
was lying on my side too and I placed a hand on the back of her
shoulder. She tensed up immediately and it was like I was touching
stone. But instead of moving my hand away, I just started rubbing in
tiny circular motions until she started relaxing. I had no words that
would make it better so I just kept my mouth shut and hoped what I
was doing was enough.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes, she turned so that she was lying on her
back. The light coming from the outside of her window was enough so I
could see that her eyes were still open and fixed on the ceiling.
Then she turned her head and her eyes were fixed on me. She just
looked at me with such a hurt in her eyes that I found my mouth
opening and words coming out that I'd never meant to say. "Do you
remember when you asked me what I was thinking?" </p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I was thinking how beautiful you are...And I just kept asking myself
how anyone so beautiful could have this much sadness in their eyes. I
didn't say anything cause I didn't want you to think I was a freak or
something." I don't know why I said those words to her. Afterwards,
her body began shaking and I thought that I'd somehow done it to her
and I was apologizing but she just released this sob and buried
herself into my arms. My arms wrapped around her body and I absorbed
her tears and the heaving sobs that wracked her small body for what
seemed like hours before they started to die down. Her head was
buried on my shoulder and her hands were holding tightly onto my
waist. Eventually her breathing evened out and I knew she was asleep.</p>

<p>The yelling had stopped. I laid there a little while longer just
listening to the silence and feeling Buffy's breath warming my neck
and I guess I dozed off like that cause when I woke up again, it was
light in the room. I slid out of Buffy's arms which was way harder
than it sounds cause she kept pulling me back even though she was
still asleep as far as I could tell. After I'd cleaned myself up in
the bathroom, I came back into her room but she was still out. I
didn't want to wake her cause she just looked so peaceful that I left
her like that and wandered downstairs to plop myself in front of the
TV and zone out on Saturday morning cartoons.</p>

<p>Around the end of the second cartoon, Buffy came into the
room. "Hey," she said softly. I sat up as she came to sit next to me.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling all right?" I asked. </p>

<p>She stared off at the television a little bit longer before she
turned her head and gave me a wide smile. "Thank you for yesterday."
Her smile faltered. "I hope I didn't freak you out too bad."</p>

<p>"No," I said quickly. "Of course you didn't. I mean, I know how it
is. You have all this stuff bottled up inside of you and sooner or
later, you just feel like you're going to pop. Don't apologize for it
B. I'm just glad I could help without screwing it up."</p>

<p>"You didn't screw up Faith. If anything, that was probably the best
night of sleep I've gotten in a long time." She smiled at me again,
that wide beautiful smile that made me feel good inside even though I
hadn't done anything...not really.</p>

<p>And of course I couldn't stand looking at it for more than a second.
I broke eye contact and said something about being hungry. She took
my hand and led me off to the kitchen where we feasted on some
cereal, toasted bread, and juice.</p>

<p>"Oh, fuck. What time is it?" I asked, around a mouthful of cereal.</p>

<p>Buffy glanced at her watch. "Around ten," she said.</p>

<p>I'd totally forgotten that Coach had told me to report to the track
early this morning. "Can you drive me to school?" I asked. I wouldn't
have asked if I wasn't desperate. Buffy's driving isn't what you'd
call safe and fun. More like 'for the love of God, please don't crash
into that lamp post' scary. I don't think she knows how bad she
really is. But I *was* desperate so as soon as she said she would, I
chugged down the juice and ran upstairs to get the duffel bag. When
we got to the track, Coach was totally pissed at me and gave me a
lecture about being on time or something like that. She finally wound
down and told me to take a couple of laps around the track. I walked
back to where Buffy was standing.</p>

<p>"Ouch," she said in sympathy.</p>

<p>I shrugged it off. "I was only a couple of hours late. You'd think I
hadn't shown up at all or something by the way she talks." She
smirked and rolled her eyes at me. "So I guess I'm gonna be stuck
here for a while. Thanks for the ride over."</p>

<p>"You don't mind if I stay for awhile and just watch you, right?" </p>

<p>"If you don't mind watching me running around in a circle like a lab
rat, be my guest. But don't blame me if you get bored." She stuck her
tongue out at me as I walked away to get changed. It was really kinda
cute, not like I was ever gonna tell her that though. She was sitting
on the bleachers when I came out a few minutes later and, on a sudden
impulse, I waved at her. At least she waved back. Otherwise, I would
have looked like more of a dork than I already did. I don't know what
was up with me when Buffy was nearby. It was like she brought out
this whole other person in me I hadn't ever known existed and I liked
how she made me feel.</p>

<p>"Spencer!" Coach yelled at me. "When you're done waving at your
girlfriend, would you mind gracing us with your presence?"</p>

<p>"You've got that sarcasm thing down pat Coach," I said, walking past
her to get warmed up. Working through a couple of stretches, I began
jogging around the track and when I felt my muscles loosening and my
body begin to warm up, I turned up the speed until I was running. The
best thing about running is that your mind is focused on nothing else
but running...at least mine is. Putting one foot in front of the
other, breathing evenly, pushing down the pain...mostly thinking
about pushing down the pain cause without that, you know you're not
doing it right. One lap passes, two, three, four. I don't keep track
after the fourth.</p>

<p>I keep going until my lungs begin to burn and my legs begin to feel
like lead. I keep going lap after lap until I nearly run myself into
the ground and it feels like I'm going to drop if I take one more
step. Then I slow down to a jog again.</p>

<p>When I finally stop, Coach comes over to me and puts a hand on my
back as I'm bent over with my hands on my knees, trying to bring my
breathing back under control. "When I said, take a few laps," she
said, "I didn't mean that you should kill yourself on the track .
You've got to take it easier, Spencer."</p>

<p>I would've said something but I was too busy panting. She handed me a
bottle of water and left me there. Picking myself up, I walked over
to the bleachers where Buffy was still sitting and took a seat one
bench down from her. </p>

<p>"Have fun?" She asked, all perky and smiling innocently.</p>

<p>I just looked up at her and uncapped the bottle to take a couple of
swallows. But I couldn't keep the grin from spreading across my face
as she kept looking at me with that silly expression on her
face. "All I need is a couple of minutes and I'll be right out there
again," I told her, letting a cocky grin slip across my face.</p>

<p>She smirked. "As what? A speed bump?"</p>

<p>I climbed up to sit next to her. "Let me repair your misconceptions
before you embarrass yourself any further Ms. Summers. You see, I'm
like the friggin Energizer Bunny." She looked at me
skeptically. "It's true. I just keep going and going and going."</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, her face lighting up. "You meant it *that* way. I
thought you were talking about how you're both fuzzy and cute."</p>

<p>"I. Am. Not. Fuzzy." I stated slowly so she wouldn't miss any words. </p>

<p>"Okay," she said, shrugging. "Then you're just cute."</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to protest again when I saw her trying but failing
to keep the grin off of her face. "Maybe you need this water more
than I do," I said instead. "I think the sun's getting to you B."</p>

<p>She deftly took the bottle from my hands and took a few sips, her
eyes still staring at me the whole time and I could feel myself
getting hot again. But this time, it had nothing to do with running.
Maybe I was wrong but this sounded and looked a lot like flirting to
me. And if it was? Buffy was cute, beautiful even...and if I was
honest with myself, way too good for me. And that didn't even take
into account that we were both girls which makes things a hell of a
lot hairier. So I shook the thoughts from my head as best I could and
smiled at her as I went back onto the track.</p>

<p>Buffy left about a half hour later and I left a couple of hours after
that. It was around four in the afternoon by the time I left . With
nothing better to do, I went home. When I walked through the front
door, I could hear the TV in the living room. Doris was probably in
there so I went the opposite way into the kitchen and fixed myself a
sandwich and got some fruit juice. As foster parents went, Doris and
her husband weren't that bad. They stayed out of my business and I
stayed out of theirs. As long as we mutually respected each other's
right to be left alone, we didn't have to say two words to each other
all day. Sometimes, even less than that. </p>

<p>Since there wasn't much else to do around the house and I'd damned
near killed myself on the track earlier, I fell asleep halfway
through finishing my sandwich. And I wasn't sure how long I was out
before a knocking at my door woke me up.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, trying to blink away the sleep. "Casey? What are you
doing here?" </p>

<p>"What am I doing here?" She repeated like she couldn't believe I was
asking such a wicked obvious question. "Faith, did you forget about
the party?"</p>

<p>"Party?"</p>

<p>"Paul's party," she said, dragging me up so that I was sitting. "Come
on, sleepyhead. Get dressed. T and Daniel are waiting outside."</p>

<p>I tried suppressing a yawn as I looked at her. "I don't know Case, I
don't feel much like partying right now."</p>

<p>Her face fell as she began pleading with me. "But you have to come.
How are we going to crash a party without you? Please. Come on.
Pretty please?" </p>

<p>She kept repeating it over and over until I couldn't take it anymore
and I finally just gave in. "Fine, I'll go. Just give me ten
minutes." She hopped up and down like some deranged bunny rabbit
before going out the door and, as soon as she did, I flopped back
onto the bed.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>After I'd left Faith, I'd decided to go home and just spend the day
lazing around but a phone call from Jessica changed my plans. Our
conversation went something like this:</p>

<p>Jess: Buffy, everybody's mad at you. They all think the stress and
pressure's gotten to you but they're still mad at what you said,
especially Jenny. Is it because of problems at home? Your parents?</p>

<p>Me: No</p>

<p>Jess: Buffy, we're your friends. We all care about you. How long have
we known each other? Since fifth grade? We can work through whatever
problems you've got. Do you want to talk about it with me? </p>

<p>Me: No.</p>

<p>Jess: Well, I think it'll be good if you come out and just hang with
everybody tonight like we used to do. We can talk about it then. Let
me pick you up tonight for Paul's party. Everyone's going to be there.</p>

<p>Me: Jess--</p>

<p>Jess: Cool, I'll pick you up tonight Buff.</p>

<p>That was the general gist of how it went, give or take a word or two.
So here I am, sitting in Jessica's VW Beetle listening to her talking
about how mad Heather and Jenny were and how everything would be just
fine if we all got together and talked our problems out. I know she
means well but she can be so annoying when she's playing mediator. I
already knew Heather and Jenny were mad and I didn't need to keep
hearing about it every fifteen seconds.</p>

<p>I hopped out of the car before it even came to a total stop as soon
as we got to Paul's house. I just wanted to get it over with and go
home. So I went inside, searching for Heather and her group with
Jessica tailing me all the way. Of course, they weren't too hard to
find. You can always spot them by the large gathering of giggling
girls and posturing boys. The ones hanging around the edges were the
least popular, hoping that just being close to the in crowd would
somehow rub off on them. And I walked past them, stopping just long
enough now and then to return a greeting. In the center was Heather.
If you wanted an analogy, Heather was the sun to everybody else's
space dirt. At least, that's how she sees herself. Everybody went
quiet as I finally stepped in front of her.</p>

<p>"Buffy," she said, looking at me with a quirked eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Hello Heather." I took a deep breath and just pushed the words out
of my mouth. "I'm sorry about what I said earlier." Jenny came to
stand next to Heather as she looked haughtily down at me. "It was
totally uncalled for and I realize that it was hurtful to both you
and Jenny. So, please accept my apology." </p>

<p>Jessica had pushed her way over to us and she added on my
behalf, "Buffy's been under a lot of pressure lately, Heather. She's
been telling me how sorry she's been all the way over here."</p>

<p>I looked over at her to see that she had a totally sincere expression
on her face and if I didn't know better, I'd buy her story too.
Heather's cool expression melted the tiniest fraction. "I understand
the pressure, Buffy. God knows, I understand. But you can't go around
snapping everybody's head off, especially us, your friends."</p>

<p>I tried not rolling my eyes and I think I succeeded . For the most
part, I just kept my head down and nodded until she was satisfied
with the amount of remorse I was showing. Jenny didn't say anything
to me which was fine as far as I was concerned. The less we talked
the better. With that out of the way, I was going to call it a night
and make up another excuse to leave but Jessica would have none of
it. For some reason, she keeps insisting that I shouldn't be
alone 'at a time like this'. I don't know what time she was talking
about but I couldn't get away no matter what inventive excuses I came
up with. </p>

<p>So, for all intents and purposes, I was stuck there, listening to
twenty different inane conversations going all around me. All this
noise competing with the thumping bass of the music made my head
start to pound along with it so I went to the kitchen to get myself
something to drink. Only problem was, the fridge seemed to be stocked
with nothing but bottles and bottles and bottles of beer...plus one
incongruously out of place ketchup bottle. I took one, figuring one
beer couldn't hurt and it'd probably make the time go faster too when
I felt an arm being thrown across my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Jack," I said, trying to slip out from under his arm. Jack was one
of those guys that thought he was God's gift to women because he had
a pretty face and a filthy rich dad. Any sort of rejection he
received, he'd take it as a personal challenge. Needless to say, I
was a challenge to him.</p>

<p>"Buffy, where have you been?" He asked. His breath smelled like he'd
had a couple of beers already. "I was looking for you."</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah," I said, taking the bottle opener from the counter and
opening up my beer. "I just got here." He slipped his arm across my
shoulders again as I took a sip from the bottle. </p>

<p>"Y'know," he said, breathing into my ear. "Paul's got a pool in the
backyard. You wanna take a dip with me?"</p>

<p>"I think you've had too much to drink if you think I'm going to say
yes." I began to walk towards the door when he grabbed my arm and
pulled me back, hard. </p>

<p>His fingers were digging into my flesh and a vein in his forehead was
popping out. "I don't know why you keep playing hard to get girl.
Look Buffy, you've got me, okay? You've got me. So stop jerking me
around." He moved in and I turned my face just in time so that his
lips grazed my cheek instead of my lips.</p>

<p>"Hey Romeo. Get your fucking hands off her." I turned my head to see
Faith standing in the doorway. I didn't know what she was doing there
but I don't think I've been more happy to see anyone in my life. I
squirmed out of Jack's grasp as Faith walked over and pulled me
behind her.</p>

<p>"Who the fuck are you?" Jack asked.</p>

<p>Faith laughed in his face and said, "Take a good look jerkoff. I'm
the one who's gonna kick your ass if you ever touch her again."</p>

<p>Jack's face started turning beet red. I don't think he's ever had a
woman threaten him before. "Let's just go, Faith." I tried pulling
her away before things escalated any further and she was just turning
to leave when Jack said something else under his breath that I
couldn't make out. Next thing I know, Faith's sitting on top of Jack
and punching the crap out of him. The only thing going for Jack is
that he's got about thirty pounds on Faith so he was able to throw
her off. By that time, people were looking through the door and the
more courageous or drunker among them were coming in to see what all
the noise was about.</p>

<p>Faith and Jack were down on the floor, trying to rip each other
apart. Someone started chanting "Fight" and pretty soon, everybody
was chanting it. They rolled around a little before Jack pinned Faith
beneath him and started punching her. Since nobody else seemed to
want to stop it, I did the only thing I could think of. I hit Jack on
the back of the head with the beer bottle I still had in my hand. The
bottle broke and the beer flowed all over his head. He looked up with
a dazed expression on his face and then Faith took advantage and
punched him across the jaw. </p>

<p>He dropped like a sack of wet laundry on top of her. I grabbed the
back of his shirt and helped her push him off as everybody started
shouting, some cheering. Most of them had definitely been hitting the
beer a bit too much tonight and I heard someone talking about calling
the cops but there was a loud symphony of hisses and boos at that
suggestion. I pulled Faith up and she wobbled slightly before
steadying herself. Now that I had a good look at her, I could see the
bloody cut next to her left eye and the cut on her lip. We navigated
our way through the crowd with her leaning on me the whole way.</p>

<p>T came up to us as we came out of the kitchen and, without a word,
helped us get out of the house. When Jessica came up and asked me
what had happened, I told her I would tell her about it later and
walked out the door. I tried to think of a bright side to this whole
situation and my sick brain came up with the thought that at least I
had found an excuse to leave and then I felt like a total heel for
thinking something like that when Faith was leaning next to me,
having gotten into a fight because of me.</p>

<p>T led us to his SUV which was parked a block away. His two other
friends were following behind and when we got to the car, Faith
leaned against the back door as T unlocked it and I helped her in
before climbing in myself. T's girlfriend got into the back seat from
the other side.</p>

<p>"What happened back there?" She asked, looking back and forth between
Faith and me.</p>

<p>Faith touched the cut on her lip with the tips of her fingers. "It
was no big deal, Casey. Just got in a fight."</p>

<p>"I can see that," Casey said. "Can you tell me why you got in a fight
five minutes after we got there?" </p>

<p>"The prick deserved it." She looked around as the car started
up. "Where are you driving T?"</p>

<p>T glanced up into the rearview mirror. "We're going to the hospital.
That cut needs stitches."</p>

<p>"It's not that deep," she began to protest.</p>

<p>"Faith," I said, taking her arm. "Your blood is covering half your
face. I'd say that's bad enough for stitches." She turned towards me
and I could tell she was about to protest again so I put a finger on
her lips to stop her. "You helped me. Now I'm going to help you. Is
that cool?"</p>

<p>Her lips moved under my finger as she grinned weakly. "Five by five,"
she said, her lips grazing against my finger with each word. My heart
sped up as I reluctantly pulled my finger away. Glancing behind
Faith, I could see Casey staring suspiciously at me and I suddenly
began feeling hot. This isn't the time to be thinking like this. It
was the second time that day that I'd felt something passing between
Faith and me. I wasn't sure what it was exactly, only that it was
something that I'd never felt with another person before.</p>

<p>When we got to the hospital, T made it his job to take care of the
paperwork in record time. I think he charged everything on his
platinum card when Faith wasn't looking. So, fifteen minutes later,
the four of us were sitting around in the waiting room waiting for
Faith to get stitched up when T looked over at me and asked, "Are you
all right?"</p>

<p>I had been playing with the can of coke he'd gotten me and I guess I
must not have looked too good for him to ask. "I'm fine," I said,
giving him a small smile. "I'm just..." I gestured helplessly around
and he nodded in understanding.</p>

<p>"So what happened?" Casey asked a minute later. "To start the fight,
I mean."</p>

<p>I cleared my throat before trying to explain. "Well, basically, Faith
caught Jack acting like a drunken prick to me and she stepped in. We
were going to just leave but Jack said something to her and the next
thing I know, they're fighting on the floor." Casey looked like she
wasn't entirely satisfied with the answer but she didn't pursue it. I
looked down at the floor and wondered if I was satisfied with that
answer either. Faith had known me barely two days but she'd already
gotten in a fight because of me. But she seemed like the type of
person to do that --- stick her neck out for her friends. Was that
all it was though? And why was I fishing for a deeper meaning anyway?
Faith was my friend. End of story.</p>

<p>So why was it that when she walked in a short while later, my heart
sped up again? When did my heart ever speed up when any of my other
friends walked in? She was smiling that signature cocky grin of hers
as I walked up to her.</p>

<p>"Five stitches," were the first two words out of her mouth and she
looked so damn proud of it that I had to laugh. Reaching out a hand,
I turned her head to the side so I could get a good look at it.</p>

<p>T came up behind me and asked, "Faith, isn't there supposed to be a
bandage covering that?"</p>

<p>Faith screwed up her face in distaste. "That bandage they put on it
was too big," she said. "So I threw it away...Got a good look there,
B?"</p>

<p>I smiled in embarrassment, realizing that I was still holding onto
her face and I let go immediately which only made her chuckle in
amusement.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>After the hospital, we spent like an hour hanging out in the parking
lot of a 24-hour minimart or something. Casey kept digging at me
about the fight. I think she was just pissed that she didn't get to
see it for herself so I offered to reenact it on T. She was all for
it but T wouldn't let me get on top of him. It wasn't like I was
really gonna punch him but he said he didn't believe me. Go figure.</p>

<p>Eventually, we left to go drop Buffy back off at her house. I was in
the back, with my eyes closed and my head resting against the back of
the seat, listening with half an ear as Casey talked about a band she
wanted to go see perform. I grinned just hearing how hyped she was
getting. When the car stopped, I opened an eye and turned my head to
look at Buffy. Before I could open my mouth and say good-bye to her,
she opened the door and pulled me out with her. </p>

<p>"Bye guys," she said. "Thanks for everything."</p>

<p>I shrugged, gave everyone a little wave through the window and let
Buffy lead me into her house. "Hey B?" I whispered. "What's up?"</p>

<p>She turned around to look at me and, in the dark, I couldn't really
see her face. "I was thinking -- actually, hoping that you'd stay the
night again? I mean, if you don't want to, I could drive you back
but --"</p>

<p>Her hands were warm in mine and I pulled her closer. "Nah, I'd love
to stay, B. Not many people can stand having me around like you."</p>

<p>"Then those people must be crazy," she said softly. I wished I could
see her face right then cause I wanted to see if she was joking. She
didn't sound like she was joking and I couldn't think of anything to
say to that. A few seconds later, she pulled me upstairs to her
bedroom and opened the lights which seemed too bright all of a
sudden. I went to sit on her bed while she searched through her
closet for her PJ's. She already knew I slept in my underwear so I
just began stripping. Off came the leather pants, then the denim
jacket, and finally my top. I stacked them on a chair next to the
door.</p>

<p>"You sure your mom won't -- " I stopped mid-sentence cause when I
turned around, Buffy was just standing there, staring at me. "See
something you like?" I asked, quirking an eyebrow.</p>

<p>She laughed nervously and then excused herself to go change. I
thought I saw a blush creeping into her face as she practically ran
to the door. I know I shouldn't have said it but the words were out
of my mouth before I could think about what I was saying. Story of my
life, really. My mouth gets me in trouble, my fists get me out of it.
But if I were honest with myself, we'd been flirting back and forth
the whole day. Nothing serious...at least, I don't think so. And,
anyway, flirting with Buffy was fun. I was still figuring out the
limits and how far I could push them.</p>

<p>Buffy walked back into the room just then dressed in a light pink top
with a heart on the front and matching pink drawstring shorts. My
eyes must've widened to twice their size cause as soon as she saw me,
she asked, "What?"</p>

<p>I shook my head in awe. "You look so damn cute," I said.</p>

<p>She came over and punched me playfully on the arm. "I thought we made
it clear today," she went on, going to sit on her bed. "*You're* the
cute one in this relationship."</p>

<p>I folded my arms in mock indignation as she played with her stuffed
pig. "If I'm cute, how come you're the one decked out in pink?" She
opened her mouth to answer but nothing came out. I smirked as she
closed her mouth and pouted. "Glad we got that clear," I said, laying
down on the bed next to her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gordo agrees with me," she said, sitting her pig on top of my
chest. </p>

<p>"That's cause his brain's made of stuffing," I said, folding my hands
under my head. "Isn't that right, Mr. Gordo?"</p>

<p>Buffy immediately snatched her pig away and whispered in one pink
ear, "Don't listen to her. She doesn't know what she's talking
about." She gave me another nasty look as I rolled my eyes,
effectively giving my opinion on the matter. Then she reached across
me to turn off the light on the desk. For a second there, I thought
she was gonna crawl on top of me. For a second there, I wished she
would. But she crawled under the covers instead and whispered "Good
night."</p>

<p>"Night B," I said, getting under the covers myself.</p>

<p>When I woke up in the morning, or afternoon, or whatever the heck
time it was, I found myself trapped under the body of a certain small
blonde. Buffy was practically lying on top of me, her leg across
mine, her arm across my chest, and her hand...her hand was on the
side of my left breast. I was afraid to even breathe cause I didn't
want her to wake up and find us like this --- that would be pretty
damn embarrassing for the both of us. But how was I gonna get out of
this without waking her?</p>

<p>I tried doing it one body part at a time, starting with the hand. Not
that it wasn't nice right where it was but it was also distracting as
hell and if I was gonna do this right, I had to focus. I almost had
it all the way off when Buffy let out a groan and decided to wrap her
arm even more tightly around my body. I sighed and stared up at the
ceiling. I had to face it. This was not working.</p>

<p>Screw it. "B? Buffy?" I said, shaking her lightly on the shoulder.
She groaned softly again as her eyes fluttered open and she picked
her head up. "Hey," I said smiling. "Uh, I need to go to the
bathroom." She looked confused for a second and then seemed to
realize that I couldn't get up if she didn't move.</p>

<p>"Sorry," she said, smiling sheepishly and untangling herself.</p>

<p>"No problem," I said, getting up. "If I were sleeping next to someone
as cuddly as me, I'd be lying on top of me too." I gave her a smirk
as I walked out the door. By the time I got out of the bathroom and
changed into something a little less skimpy, Buffy was already
downstairs in the kitchen with a bowl of cereal in front of
her. "Where's your mom?" I asked, getting a bowl.</p>

<p>"She's visiting her sister, my aunt," she said chewing around a
mouthful of Lucky Charms. "She'll be back tomorrow."</p>

<p>I sat down next to her at the counter and poured myself some cereal
but before I could take my first bite, the doorbell rang. </p>

<p>"It's 10:30," Buffy said, glancing at her watch. "Wonder who it could
be?" She got up and walked to answer the front door. After a few
minutes had passed and she still wasn't back, I drained the last of
the milk and walked over to the living room where I could heard
voices. There was some old guy in there with her but his back was to
me so I couldn't make out a face. Buffy saw me in the doorway and
waved me in. I went over to sit next to her and saw that the guy she
was talking to had shaggy salt and pepper hair, and a craggy, longish
face.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell her what you just told me?" Buffy said with
something like defiance in her voice.</p>

<p>His expression didn't change even as he spoke. "In every generation,
there is a Chosen One. She alone will stand against the vampires, the
demons and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer. You, Buffy, are
the Slayer." He sounded like he was reading from a script and the
stuff he was saying sounded like it belonged in a comic book. "You
don't believe me," he stated without missing a beat.</p>

<p>"I'm seriously beginning to regret the letting you in part," Buffy
said drily.</p>

<p>"Turn on the TV to any news channel. It's already begun." He sat back
and waited with his arms patiently folded. Eventually Buffy took the
remote and did as he said. I was still keeping an eye on him in case
he flipped out or something when the report on the television caught
my attention.</p>

<p>"....tragic attack on a teenage party last night. It was held in the
house behind me at the home of David Kines, an affluential defense
attorney. According to police, the party was being hosted by his son,
Paul when it was broken up by gangmembers, high on drugs. Witnesses
say that some members of the gang were wearing grotesque masks. By
the time this rampage was over, several party goers, including its
host were dead and dozens more were wounded..."</p>

<p>Buffy had her hand covering her mouth and a look of complete, utter
shock on her face. "No," she whispered, still staring at the
TV. "What did you do?!" She shouted, angrily turning on the old guy.</p>

<p>"I didn't do anything," he replied, still with the same placid look
on his face. "Most people willfully deny what they see with their own
eyes. Those weren't gangmembers and they weren't wearing masks. They
were vampires. And the people they've killed will rise. It is your
job to see that they don't."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," Buffy said, shaking her head. I moved closer
to her and took her hand in mine. She threw me a grateful look.</p>

<p>"You don't want to." He leaned forward in his seat. "It's a natural
reaction but we don't have time for this." In a lightning fast move I
never would've pegged him capable of, he took something from inside
his coat and threw it at me.</p>

<p>I barely had time to say, "Shit!" and bring my hands up when Buffy's
hand appeared out of nowhere, grabbing whatever it was that the old
guy had thrown at me. "What the fuck!" I stared at the wooden --
stake? -- which was an inch from my face.</p>

<p>"You see?" He said with a small smile. "No normal human would've been
able to do that. You were made to fight vampires."</p>

<p>I couldn't decide whether to stare in shock or to show him what I
thought of his cheap trick. "Do that again and I'll kick your ass.
Old man or not," I said, almost growling at him. His head canted to
the side and he mutely nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you believe me now?" He asked, looking at Buffy. I don't think
Buffy really heard him cause she was still staring at the stake in
her hand. "My name is Merrick," he continued on as if she had
answered him. "I am your Watcher and as your Watcher, my job is to
train you and prepare you as best I can so that you can realize your
duty and fulfill your destiny." My head was spinning already and I
couldn't imagine how Buffy was feeling. If this were real like it was
starting to look like more and more, her life had just gotten a
hundred times more complicated in a few short minutes.</p>

<p>I took Buffy's hand which was still holding the stake and pulled it
down. "B, look at me. Are you all right?" Her eyes wandered up to
mine, glazed and stunned. But even as I watched, they began clearing
up, gaining a sharp, clear focus. </p>

<p>She held my gaze a moment longer and then turned back to
Merrick. "What do I need to do?" I think that was the first time I'd
ever heard her so serious and focused.</p>

<p>"You're stronger, faster, tougher than most humans but so are
vampires," Merrick began. "First, you must learn how to kill them.
What you hold in your hand is your greatest weapon. A wooden stake
through the heart will kill them. Direct exposure to sunlight will
roast them. Holy water and crosses will burn them. Tonight, we'll go
to the morgue and stop the newly made vampires from rising and until
then, I will train you."</p>

<p>"Okay," she said, taking a deep breath. "But before we train, can I
change out of this first? I don't think pink jamies are conducive to
full workout conditions." She left the room, leaving Merrick and me
to stare at each other.</p>

<p>"You might want to change too," he finally said. </p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She needs a sparring partner and I'm too old for that." Even though
I didn't quite believe him, I slowly got up and followed Buffy
upstairs to change.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Vampires, demons, slayers. Who knew any of this stuff was real? Well,
I guess I knew now. Merrick made me train nonstop all afternoon and
for someone who looked as old as he did, he still put me down on my
butt a couple of times. The only reason I put up with it as well as I
did was because he showed me what I was capable of doing. The powers
I have are so incredible and he says I've only just begun to scratch
the surface. When I'd asked him where the powers had came from and
why I didn't have them until now, he told me bluntly that a Slayer
had to die to pass on her powers which kinda dampened the mood
considerably. So, in addition to finding out that I was destined to
fight demons and vampires for the rest of my life, I also find out
that my life would probably not last too long anyway. What had
Merrick said?</p>

<p>"Most Slayers don't live past their eighteenth birthday."</p>

<p>That statement sucked the wind right out of me. Eighteen? I'd just
turned seventeen. Dying was some far off concept that had never had
anything to do with my life but here it was being jammed down my
throat and I couldn't do a thing about it. Faith had immediately
wrapped me into her arms and even though it didn't change anything,
it made me feel just a little bit better and I didn't let go until
Merrick made it known that it was time to get back to training. </p>

<p>The only other interruption was when Jessica called. She'd been
shaken up by the attack yesterday but aside from that, she was fine.
But the same thing couldn't be said about Jenny, Paul, and a couple
of other people from the party who'd been killed. When I heard that
Jenny was one of the victims, I was shocked cause I'd seen her just a
couple of hours ago. She had been alive and even though we weren't
even friends, knowing she could be one of the vampires I'd have to
stake tonight made me sick.</p>

<p>Once 7:00 rolled around, Merrick, Faith, and me were at the hospital,
trying to inconspicuously sneak into the morgue. The butterflies in
my stomach were fluttering triple time from anxiety and fear. I could
die tonight. If I messed up, Faith could die.</p>

<p>"Maybe, I should do this alone," I said to her again.</p>

<p>"Maybe you should." I felt relieved before she went on. "But you're
not gonna. We're in this together, B. After all, I can't let you have
all the fun." She grinned at me and I wanted to pull her to me and
hold her as tight as I could because I knew she was as scared as I
was but she wanted to act tough for me. I would've done it too if
Merrick didn't choose that moment to come back.</p>

<p>"It's deserted," he said. "Let's go." He led us down to the basement
and into a room with what looked like drawers or cabinet doors all
around the walls. I knew that there were bodies behind each one and I
tried not to shiver in the cool atmosphere. Merrick picked up a
clipboard hanging from a nail in the wall and looked through the
entries while Faith and I took out our stakes and stood there looking
nervously around. I was half-expecting a vampire to pop out at any
second and Faith looked like she was thinking the same thing too.</p>

<p>Merrick began opening one cabinet after another, pulling out the
trays until he had five open. I had to remind myself to start
breathing again after he pulled the first body out. It was Jenny.
Naked, pale, and waxy, she laid there and I began to wonder if I
could really do this. I clutched the stake tighter until my knuckles
began turning white.</p>

<p>"Now we wait," Merrick said, sitting down in the only chair in the
room.</p>

<p>We started out standing in the middle of the room but, pretty soon,
Faith and I were both sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall.
We waited for fifteen minutes in silence. It just didn't seem right
to talk in that room. Something along the lines of not disturbing the
dead --- I guess that didn't apply to staking them though.</p>

<p>When I first saw one of the corpses twitch, I thought I was imagining
things. When it twitched again, I jumped up and ran over. I raised
the stake over its heart and glanced up to Merrick before jamming it
into the corpse's chest. Its eyes opened wide before the whole body
dissolved to dust. I couldn't even take a breath before it seemed
like the whole room was full of walking undead vampires. They'd all
risen and they were all pissed.</p>

<p>"Didn't get enough sleep?" I asked the vampire who had been Paul. He
growled and his face changed. Ridges protruded from his brow and
fangs extended from his mouth.</p>

<p>"I'll make you bleed," he said, drool dripping from the corners of
his mouth. And then he charged, ramming his shoulder into my gut and
bringing us both crashing to the floor. Before he could bite down on
me, I brought my knees up and pushed him off. I scrambled to stake
him before he could get off his back. Turning to look for Faith, I
saw that she and Jenny were trading blows. With a running start, I
jumped and kicked Jenny in the right kidney and Faith took the
opportunity to stake her. We looked at each other for a few seconds
after Jenny turned to dust and then Faith began laughing.</p>

<p>"Shit! That was fun." Rotating her shoulder gingerly, she
added, "Wicked painful but still fun."</p>

<p>I went over to her side immediately. "You all right?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Five by five," she said with a grin and then turned to
Merrick. "How'd we do for a first time old man?"</p>

<p>"You didn't die," he stated matter-of-factly. "Good start." Then he
turned and left the room.</p>

<p>"Inspirational words indeed," I said with a smirk. Grabbing Faith's
hand, I pulled her out. "Let's go before they make us dustbust this
place."</p>

<p>After I dropped Merrick off at the motel he was staying at and
listened to him lecture us the whole way about how the Slayer thing
was this huge big secret which we shouldn't tell anybody about, I
drove Faith back to her house. It was the first time I'd actually
been to her house and as that thought crossed my mind, I also
realized that I knew nothing about her family --- not if she had any
siblings, not if she had any pets, not anything. And since she didn't
invite me in when we got there, I was still in the dark about that
stuff. I promised myself that I'd ask her about it tomorrow because I
really wanted to know more about her. In fact, I wanted to know
everything there was to know about her. Just thinking about seeing
her tomorrow made me smile.</p>

<p>It was funny in a weird sort of way. Today, I'd found out I had a
destiny I didn't even know about, that I was going to have to risk my
life every night slaying demons, that my life would by all accounts
end in a year and yet, when I walked through the door of my house, I
still had a smile on my face. I spent the rest of the night finishing
up some work for school, making myself a dinner of ready made frozen
food which tastes about as bad as it sounds, and watching some TV. I
was just about to call it a night and go off to bed when the front
door opened and my dad walked in. His face lit up as soon as he saw
me.</p>

<p>"Hey sweetie," he said, coming over and giving me a bear hug like he
always did. "How's my favorite girl in the whole world?"</p>

<p>"Suffocating," I said as he let me go with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"I missed you, honey," he said, cupping my face in his hands. "I know
I've been scarce lately but with the quarterlies coming up, they've
been working me to the bone."</p>

<p>"I'm just glad to see you dad."</p>

<p>He pulled me into another hug. "I'm glad to see you too honey. How
about some dessert?" He asked, releasing me. I could spot the twinkle
in his eye from a mile away. </p>

<p>"Chocolate sundaes?" I asked, smiling. </p>

<p>"With whipped cream," he said, chuckling.</p>

<p>We glutted ourselves on ice cream and, as tradition dictated, wiped
the bowls clean. By the time I shuffled off to bed, I felt like a
walking sundae myself. But I was happy because it was my dad and I
knew he loved me just as much as I loved him. Even if he hadn't been
around lately, it didn't mean anything because I couldn't stay mad at
him, no matter what he did. The only thing was that when I got into
bed and cuddled up with Mr. Gordo, I wished Faith was there too. I'd
kinda gotten used to having her around and now that she wasn't, I
missed how safe and comforting I felt in her presence.</p>

<p>The first night she'd spent in my house, I'd woken up to my mom and
dad's yelling and, like always, I just wanted the bed or the ground
or something to open up and swallow me whole so I wouldn't have to
hear it anymore. I was so sick of it all, I wanted to scream so that
I could at least drown them out. That's when I heard Faith whimpering
next to me. At first, I thought she was awake but then she started
muttering. Over the yelling, all I could make out was her saying
something about her dad and then she just kept saying please and
begging and I wanted to roll over and comfort her or help her in some
way but I couldn't move. All I could do was lay there and listen to
my parents fighting and feeling totally useless. And when I thought I
was going to go out of my mind, I felt a hand on my back. It was
Faith. She helped me. She held me. And she didn't question or judge.
So yeah, I miss having her here.</p>

<p>But I managed to get through the night and when morning came, I got
ready to go to school again. Going through the same normal routine
made everything else that had happened in the last twenty four hours
seem even stranger than it already was. Dad wasn't there when I got
up. He'd probably gone to the office already. I was hoping to see him
before he left but I guess I'd have to get up way earlier to do that.
The attack at Saturday's party was all over the news on the radio. So
was what had happened in the morgue last night, only they didn't
mention anything about vampires or us dusting them. No, they just
thought it was the work of some crazy cult who had a thing for
stealing the bodies of dead people...ewww, how gross is that?</p>

<p>The mood at school was pretty somber too. I found Heather and her
group outside and some of the girls were sniffling and crying as they
talked about what a tragedy it was and how much they were going to
miss Jenny. When Jessica saw me, she pulled me into a hug and began
crying on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh God, Buffy. I still can't believe it. I keep expecting to see
Jenny any minute even though I know she's dead."</p>

<p>I patted her on the shoulder and said all the things you're supposed
to say in situations like that. Then Heather hugged me, though she
didn't cry. She said we were going to hold an emergency squad meeting
after school today before we all left for our first class. When I got
to Mr. Drummond's class, Faith was already in her seat and I started
feeling guilty about how happy I was to see her but the guilt
disappeared as soon as she smiled that full out smile at me.</p>

<p>"Hey," I said, quickly sitting down.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself." Her customary piece of notebook paper was on the desk
in front of her as was the pen I'd given her on that first day. Just
seeing it in her hand put a silly grin on my face. And I knew it was
a silly grin because she asked, "Why do you have that goofy ass grin
on your face? Not that it's not cute and all but if it's cause I'm
doing something goofy, you'd tell me right? I mean, you wouldn't just
let me keep acting goofy without warning me, right?" She looked at me
suspiciously and I just started laughing which drew the attention of
the whole class. I clamped a hand over my mouth and looked to see
that she was smirking. </p>

<p>"Thanks a lot," I hissed with a mock glare as Mr. Drummond started
the class.</p>

<p>She gave me an innocent 'who me?' look and then totally ignored me
and turned her attention to the front of the class. It was the usual
boring lecture following the moment of silence we took for the deaths
of the five people at the party and the collection of the reports
we'd worked on during the weekend. As soon as the class ended though,
I reached over and punched Faith on the arm.</p>

<p>"Ow, what was that for?" She asked with a wounded expression.</p>

<p>"To wake you up and because you made me look like an idiot earlier."</p>

<p>She grinned, folding her piece of paper and stuffing it into her
pocket. "Thanks but I can't take all the credit." Before I could make
the appropriate retort, she winked and took off, leaving me grinning
my silly grin again.</p>

<p>The rest of the day passed by in a blur. During lunch, I saw Faith
and her group sitting near the far wall and I was tempted to go join
them but Jessica was holding onto my hand and I couldn't get away.
And maybe I wasn't ready to sever all ties with my clique yet. Even
as innocuous as who you sit with during lunch can have tremendous
ramifications for the rest of your social life --- during high school
anyway. So I wasn't ready to forsake what I knew and what I was
comfortable with even though I wanted to. The people I sat with were
the only friends I'd known for so long that I was scared to lose
them. Call me a coward. Faith seemed to understand what I was going
through though because every time we caught each other's gaze, she'd
give me a little smile which just made everything seem so much better.</p>

<p>When school ended, I was putting away some books in my locker when
someone tapped me on the shoulder. Purely on instinct which I didn't
even know I had until that moment, I whirled around and grabbed the
wrist of whoever was standing behind me.</p>

<p>"Merrick, what are you doing here and why are you sneaking up on me?"</p>

<p>He shook my hand off and said with a droll expression, "If you
weren't so preoccupied, you would've heard me coming a mile away and
as for what I'm doing here, we have training."</p>

<p>"I have a meeting to go to." He kept looking at me like what I said
didn't mean anything. "So we'll have to train later...after my
meeting. I mean, I do have a social life. I just can't abandon it."</p>

<p>"You're a Slayer, Buffy," he said in all seriousness. "You're *the*
Slayer and there's only you to protect the world against every
vampire and demon who wants to wreak havoc on the human race. And if
training means it'll keep you alive that much longer and help in your
fight that much better then I have no problem wrecking your social
life."</p>

<p>He was right. And I couldn't do anything about it *because* he was
right. I wanted to tell him to take his destiny and duty and training
and take a hike off the deep end of a canyon. But I'd seen vampires
with my own eyes. I'd killed them with my own hands. And I couldn't
pretend like they didn't exist. I couldn't argue that cheerleading
practice was more important than saving the world. All the while, he
was looking at me expectantly so I finally slammed the locker door
shut and turned to face him. </p>

<p>"Fine, let's go." If my tone was a little harsh, it was only because
I realized the extent of the sacrifice I was expected to endure. My
life was not mine anymore.</p>

<p>"First we have to pick up Faith," he said, heading to the back of the
school.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, jogging to catch up with him. "Why do we have to
involve her? Being a Slayer might be my duty but it's not hers. I
don't want to put her in danger...and anyway, I thought you said it
was really important that nobody knows about this, about me being a
Slayer."</p>

<p>Merrick glanced at me as we continued walking down the hall. "Don't
worry about Faith. She can take care of herself," he said in his slow
drawl. "And she doesn't have to get involved if she doesn't want to.
But I have a feeling she would want to help you." He paused slightly
before glancing at me again. "And I think you want her help too."</p>

<p>I didn't know how to respond to that because, yes, I did want her
help. As selfish as that was, I still wanted her by my side even
though I felt guilty about wanting that. So I followed him without a
word.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I took a deep breath and pulled the stake out from where it had been
tucked into the back of my pants. Shit. I've got to get a holster or
something cause wood chafes like a bitch. While I'm thinking about
that, there's a loud crash behind the door and I take that as my cue
to kick it open. Inside, there was supposed to be this big vamp nest
that Buffy and me were going to exterminate tonight. Some of them
were supposed to be the same ones that had attacked the party last
week. Only problem was, there weren't any vamps inside. Not unless
they'd learned how to become invisible or really, really tiny.</p>

<p>Buffy walked up to me, looking around at the empty warehouse. From
the shattered glass on the floor and the broken window, I guessed she
must have taken the dramatic entrance. "You think the vamp lied?" I
asked. Some loser vampire we were going to stake last night tipped us
off about this nest. I guess he thought we'd let him go if he spilled
something juicy. Boy, was he wrong.</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged, still looking around. "You'd think a last confession
would at least be truthful."</p>

<p>"Shows you can't trust 'em worth shit."</p>

<p>She suddenly crouched down and wiped a finger on the ground. "Blood,"
she stated. "Recent."</p>

<p>"So if they were here, why'd they leave? And the million dollar
question, where'd they go?"</p>

<p>"Where else would a bunch of vampires go?" She stood up again with a
thoughtful expression. "They'd want to go where the food is." Then a
sickened look crossed her face and I wondered what she was
thinking. "Faith, the dance is tonight."</p>

<p>It was like all the air suddenly whooshed out of my lungs. The dance?
It was just some stupid school event. I'd heard Casey talking about
it all week. She'd been so excited cause T had asked her to be his
date and she'd dragged me everywhere looking for the perfect
dress. "They can't be at that dance," I said, my stomach churning
into a knot. "It's just some stupid lame high school thing. How would
they even know about it?"</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed me by the shoulders and steadied me. "I'm probably
wrong but we have to make sure, Faith. We'll call Merrick first. This
might be bigger than we know."</p>

<p>I slipped the stake back into my pants. "Let's go." </p>

<p>The whole time we were on our way to the dance, I wanted to scream
cause I just wanted to be there already. I didn't want to think about
what could happen to T or Casey or Daniel if we didn't get there in
time. For once, I was glad for Buffy's awful driving. Worrying about
crashing into trees, cars, and people distracted me enough so I
wasn't killing myself asking what if? But as soon as we stopped in
the school's parking lot, I jumped out and ran to the gym where they
were holding the dance. I could hear Buffy right behind me as I
crashed through the doors.</p>

<p>The entire room turned to look at us. It was like something out of a
painting seeing as how still they were all standing and gawking. And
then, as if on cue, everybody began talking, some pointing, some
snickering, but all still alive.</p>

<p>I looked at Buffy standing next to me. She gave a relieved smile as
she took my hand. Everything was fine and I felt almost high after
all the worry. I saw Casey waving at me from across the room with T
at her side and I was just about to wave back when the doors behind
us crashed open again. Buffy pulled me back further into the room. I
heard the doors on the other side of the gym crashing open a few
seconds later. Some guy in a leather jacket walked in leading a group
of about ten other people. He growled, vamping out.</p>

<p>Looked like we were right after all. Shit. This was one time I wished
we were dead wrong. The guys behind leather boy vamped out as screams
came from behind us. Buffy let go of my hand and went right up to the
leader, punching him across the face. I met the first of the vampires
who charged in behind them and it was just a blur of punches and
kicks for the next few minutes. After I finally staked the vamp, I
took a look around and it was just so fucking crazy. It looked like
there were vampires everywhere and people were running and screaming.
I tried looking for T and the others but I couldn't make them out in
the confusion. </p>

<p>Then I found myself on the ground as something jumped me from behind.
I tried bucking and throwing it off my back but it was a dead weight.
Worse, it was choking me. Damn, was this how I was going to die?
Squeezed to death by an undead blood sucker who jumped me from
behind? Just when I thought I was gonna pass out, the hands around my
neck suddenly let go and the weight got off my back. Turning around,
I looked up and saw T struggling with some vamped out chick so I
picked the stake off the ground next to me and plunged it into her
heart. The struggling vamp disappeared into a pile of dust and I was
left staring into T's shocked face.</p>

<p>"T, try to get these people out of here," I said, hearing the rawness
grating on my voice. "Get as many as you can out. Can you handle that
for me?"</p>

<p>He blinked a couple of times and then nodded, taking off into the
crowd. Looking around again, I ran at one vamp who was so busy
feeding on a girl, he probably didn't even feel me stake him from the
back. The girl fell to the floor but she wasn't dead or nothing so I
helped her back up and pointed her to an open doorway, hoping she'd
make it out okay. By this time, there weren't many people left in the
gym --- not any alive anyway. I saw Buffy surrounded by a bunch of
vamps across the room and was just on my way to help her out when I
saw flames shooting up from behind a long overturned table. I went
over, grabbed the tablecloth from off the floor and lit it. Vampires
weren't supposed to be big fans of fire.</p>

<p>I turned around while the cloth was lighting up praying that Buffy
was still holding her own when the circle of vamps opened up a little
and I saw Merrick's body lying on the ground next to her. It wasn't
possible. It couldn't be Merrick cause Merrick's this tough old coot
who I pictured hanging around till he was a hundred and twenty or
something. I stood there frozen to the spot hoping that it wasn't
what it looked like and it was only when the fire licked at my hand
that I snapped out of the shock and realized that Buffy was in
serious trouble.</p>

<p>I ran over to the vampire get together and screamed at the top of my
lungs cause I wanted to see their ugly faces when they burned. Buffy
ducked out of the way as I tossed the now flaming table cloth at the
whole bunch of fuckers. I helped Buffy carry Merrick out of the gym
as they screamed. As soon as we were out, she locked and barred the
doors behind her and ran around to the other side of the building to
do the same thing.</p>

<p>Merrick looked so pale and small lying there. The top of his head was
covered in blood and slicked his hair down. I tried looking for a
pulse but I couldn't find one, not on the wrist or the neck. I put my
ear to his chest and I heard nothing. Buffy came back and dropped to
her knees next to me.</p>

<p>"He's dead, isn't he?" She asked in a whisper. I looked over at her
and she was staring dully down at his body. I couldn't do anything
except watch as tears slipped from her eyes. There were sirens in the
distance and I could feel other people milling around us but it was
like everything was happening through a haze and nothing I saw was
real. Someone kneeled down on the other side of me and pulled me into
a hug.</p>

<p>"Casey?" She kept holding me as T and Daniel walked up behind her.
They were saying something but by now, the sirens were too loud and
people were starting to yell again. I looked next to me and saw Buffy
being pulled away by her friends. I wanted to say something to stop
her but then the gym blew up. </p>

<p>The whole fucking building blew up. Pieces of mortar and brick rained
down and flames shot high up into the sky before slowly dying back
into a modest roast. I was tossed a couple of feet away along with
everyone else and through the dull ringing in my ears and the blurred
vision, I saw firetrucks and ambulances and cop cars pulling up. I
felt someone lifting me up and pushing me towards one of those
ambulances. I tried telling them that I wasn't hurt, that they'd
better get their fucking hands off me but they didn't listen. They
never listened. They stuck a needle in me cause they said I was
hysterical and then I couldn't do anything cause I felt myself
getting real tired.</p>

<p>I woke up with a nasty taste in my mouth and my head feeling way too
heavy. When I opened my eyes, I saw people in scrubs running around,
looking like they were busy. I yanked out the IV someone had stuck in
my arm and got up from the bed as carefully as I could. Everything
was still woozy when I first got on my feet but after a couple of
steps, they started clearing up. Nobody even tried to stop me cause,
like I said, they were all too busy. I saw a few familiar faces from
the school as I made my way out of the room but not the one I really
wanted to see. I was still kinda numb from what had happened. Merrick
was dead --- the old guy was dead.</p>

<p>But if I were sad about it, Buffy must be devastated. I remembered
the look on her face and all I could think about as I stumbled
through the hospital was finding her and helping her. The nurse's
station was total chaos with everyone taking calls and shouting
instructions. When I finally snagged someone's attention, she told me
if Buffy Summers had been admitted, her name wasn't listed which left
me wanting to wring her neck. I turned around and nearly wet myself
when I saw Mrs. Summers coming through the doors with a frantic look
on her face. She spotted me and something like relief washed over her
face.</p>

<p>"Faith, oh thank God," she said, rushing up to me and putting a hand
on my arm. "All they told me over the phone was that Buffy was here
and that the school's gym had burned down. I don't even know what's
going on. Do you know if she's all right?"</p>

<p>"She's fine Mrs. Summers," I said, seeing her briefly closing her
eyes and smile in relief. "But I can't find her here." I pointed
behind me in disgust. "And they don't seem to know anything either."</p>

<p>She got this determined look in her eyes and walked right up to one
of the nurses, demanding to know where her daughter was. The nurse
looked startled for a moment before quickly looking through the
computer and pointing us down the hall to one of the large rooms. As
we walked there, I couldn't help but shoot Buffy's mom an admiring
glance and say, "You go Mrs. S." She kinda smiled in embarrassment as
we walked through the door the nurse had indicated. I spotted Buffy
right away, sitting up in one of the beds, looking so lost and sad
that it made me ache to put my arms around her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Summers did what I wanted to as she ran over to her daughter and
wrapped her into a tight hug. I walked up behind them, feeling like
this was a personal moment I shouldn't be watching so I turned my
head away to give them a little privacy. The rest of the large room
was filled up with beds just like the one I'd woken up on. And on
those beds were more kids from the school looking like something out
of the "Night of the Living Dead." Some of them were looking over at
us and I wondered what they were thinking. Were they thankful that
we'd saved them? Did they even know we'd saved them? Fuck. What was
the point of saving all their asses if they didn't even know what
we'd done? I know Merrick would've pointed out that saving people was
all the thanks you needed. But where had that gotten him? He'd died
saving these people and nobody but Buffy and me knew what he'd
sacrificed. </p>

<p>"Faith?"</p>

<p>I turned angrily back to Buffy and her mom before I remembered it
wasn't them I was mad at. Buffy's eyes were bright with unshed tears
and her lower lip was quivering. Without thinking, I rushed over and
wrapped her up in my arms, holding onto her as tight as I could.
Soon, another pair of arms circled around us and I knew it was Mrs.
Summers. And sitting there like that, wrapped up in each other's
arms, I knew we made for quite a sight but I didn't care cause this
was exactly where I needed to be and what I needed to be doing at
this exact moment.</p>

<p>Eventually, we disengaged from the big group hug and got Buffy
checked out of there. Mrs. Summers asked me something about where my
parents were. I told her my 'foster' parents were probably asleep by
now. I looked away before I could get the pity look from her. I
didn't need that, especially not from someone like her. So we got in
her car with me and Buffy in the back seat. In the back of my mind, I
wondered where T and them were at but then Buffy moved in close to
me, resting her head on my shoulder and wrapping her arms around my
waist. I kinda lost my train of thought with her snuggled up so close
like that.</p>

<p>"Faith? Would you like to stay over tonight?" Mrs. Summers asked from
the driver's seat.</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah. I'd love to Mrs. S." She didn't have to ask twice. She
probably asked cause she thought Buffy could use the company of a
friend but some part of me kept wanting to think that it was more
than that. That she cared about me too. Screwy thoughts, I know but I
couldn't get rid of them.</p>

<p>When we got to her house, Mrs. Summers got us some cocoa and we
talked about what had happened. I couldn't really tell her what
*really* happened so I made up some story about gang members. Adults
seemed to eat that kind of shit up. As for the gym blowing up, I
couldn't really explain that. I knew there was a fire in there but I
would've figured it would've burnt the building down, not blow it up
like some action movie stunt finale. Buffy was silent the whole time
I was bullshitting and she was silent when we walked up to her room
too.</p>

<p>"You all right, B?" I asked, closing the bedroom door behind me. She
went and sat down on the bed, her head tilting forward into her
hands. "B?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't save him," she brokenly whispered as I took a seat next
to her. "He died because I couldn't save him." I tried to interrupt
but she just went on. "I wasn't good enough to save my own Watcher. I
*saw* that vamp sneaking up behind him but I wasn't fast enough and
then he was lying on the ground and I knew I'd let him down." She
turned and looked at me, her eyes full of hurt. "What am I going to
do Faith?"</p>

<p>My mouth stuttered open but I couldn't say anything. All I could do
was pull her into my arms and let her bury her head into my shoulder.
I knew there wasn't anything she could do because I knew no matter
how hard she wished and no matter how many times she reran the scene
through her mind, nothing was going to change the fact that Merrick
was dead.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>It was Wednesday. Three days after the gym exploded and...Merrick
died. It still hurt so much to think about it but I found that
slaying a whole bunch of vampires every night made me feel better.
Not much but it was better than feeling useless and lying on my bed
feeling sorry for myself. It had been two days since I found out that
my school had expelled me for burning down the gym. My mom had
stormed into the Principal's office, demanding to know how they could
be such complete morons. Her words, not mine. But when she came out
fifteen minutes later, she looked shaken up and looked at me like she
didn't even know me. I found out later that some of the students,
some of the same people I'd saved had come forward and said they saw
me throwing in large gas cannisters and locking the gym doors. I
fully admit to locking the doors but I don't know where they came up
with the gas cannisters. Was there a mass hallucination I didn't know
about? The school decided not to press charges though. I guess I
should be thankful for that.</p>

<p>It was also two days ago that I found out my parents were having a
divorce. They both sat me down and told me they couldn't be together
anymore. That things had been bad for a long time now and that I
shouldn't feel like it was my fault that they were splitting up. They
told me the only reason they'd been together as long as they had been
was because of me. They told me a lot of other things too but I lost
track of the explanations. All I knew was that we wouldn't be a
family anymore.</p>

<p>It had been just one day since my mom had announced that she was
going to move out of LA and that I was going with her. She gave me
all these reasons why the move would be good for the both of us but
how could it be good when I was going to be taken from everything I'd
known, from *everybody* I'd known, from my dad? I hated it and I let
her know it before I ran up into my room and slammed the door shut. </p>

<p>And now, today, as if everything else hadn't been enough of a shock,
Faith tells me she's moving again. </p>

<p>"I can't help it B. Doris doesn't want me around anymore. She says
I'm more trouble than I'm worth so they're shipping me off to the
State home until they can stick me with another foster family. I'm
just here to say a quick good-bye before I have to go."</p>

<p>I was starting to panic as I grabbed her by the front of her
shirt. "You can't go. Faith, how could you just leave me like this?"</p>

<p>A pained look crossed her face and I knew that was the wrong thing to
say. "You think I want to? This isn't my decision. Shit, they don't
care what I want. They just want me to keep my mouth shut and stay
out of trouble, at least till my eighteenth birthday when they can
unload me from the system."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that...I don't know what I mean
anymore." I pulled her into a hug. "But I know I don't want you to
go." </p>

<p>"It's like a band aid, B," she said softly, hugging me to her. "You
just have to do it quick." And then she let go and walked out the
door without a backward glance. I watched from the door as she got
into a car and drove away and I knew exactly what I needed to do. </p>

<p>As soon as mom came home that night, I told her what had happened to
Faith. "You can do something mom," I said, watching her carefully for
signs that she was catching on to what I was getting at. "Faith
doesn't have to be dumped from one uncaring family to another. You
can do something about it." She looked at me with a sad expression on
her face but I cut her off before she could say anything. "Mom, you
like Faith as much as I do and Faith *loves* you. Why can't you adopt
her or something? You're moving to get a new start right? Well, Faith
needs a new start more than anyone I know. Mom, please..." I employed
the puppy dog eyes, looking at her, pleading with her.</p>

<p>I could see all the reasons why she thought she couldn't do it
flitting through her eyes as she mulled over it and I thought my
heart was going to break as she finally opened her mouth, probably to
give me some of those reasons. But instead, she said, "Maybe you're
right." </p>

<p>I almost knocked my chair over as I rushed over to hug her. "Thank
you, thank you, thank you, thank you," I said again and again,
feeling the tears welling up in my eyes.</p>

<p>I heard her muttering that it might take time to get through all the
red tape but I didn't care. I'd gotten her to say yes and that was
the most important step. Faith wouldn't be alone and neither would I.
The rest of the week went by in a blur of boxing and packing and
saying good-bye to everybody. T had come by one morning with Casey
and Daniel and we hung out for a while before they left. It was a
welcome break from the hectic pace I'd been going through but it was
over far too soon. Before I even knew it, I was in my mom's car,
waving good-bye to my dad as we drove away.</p>

<p>Sunnydale. That's where we were going. Maybe mom was right. Maybe
this really is my new start.</p>
