<P>An: I'm soooo sorry that it has taken me so long to update. My dad was in a car accident so I hadn't really had time to write and even if I did, I wasn't really up for it and I'm sure the story would have suffered. So here is the next chapter and enjoy!</P><P><U>Chapter 4</U></P><P>(Beth POV)</P><P>Today is already an amazing day! I know this because when I opened my eyes this morning I saw a sleeping Kate and that left me with an indescribable feeling. I've never seen someone in such sweet peace before. I may be pushing my luck but that doesn't stop me from cautiously lifting my hand and tracing her face. I start out by harmlessly putting a blonde curl behind her ear. Gradually my hand slides down to her cheek and I can't stop myself from lightly caressing it. She makes a beautiful sound and scoots closer to me.  This action only pushes me on. My betraying hand continues to explore her neck and the rest of her face when it finally lands on the spot I want it the most, her lips.</P><P>I lightly trace them and am flooded by the memories of our short kiss in John's truck. It was so soft, light, and tender. I'd give anything to kiss her again. We were so close the night before, I really wish Lori had better timing. It's probably for the best because Kate might have freaked out afterwards and that's added tension that we don't need. I come back to reality when I feel Kate snuggle closer to me. I look down at her and I can't help but fall in love with her all over again. I lean down and leave a lingering kiss on her head before carefully getting out of the bed. She grunts and hugs my pillow instead…too cute!</P><P>I watch her for a little while longer before I decide to take a shower. The reason I'm letting her sleep is because school got canceled today due to the weather. I found a whole new reason to love nature…not that I didn't already.</P><P>(Kate POV)</P><P>I wake up alone. My best guess is that Beth is downstairs talking to my mom.  Those two really do spend too much time together. I chuckle as I get up to head to the bathroom to wash my face. I reach my bathroom and due to my sleepy state, I open the door without knocking. Sweet Jesus! Beth is way hotter without clothes on…Damn! Did I really just think that?</P><P>Beth is startled and grabs the towel. I quickly turn around. "Oh my god Beth…I am so unbelievably sorry!" I have my face buried in my hand and if I got any redder, I would be a tomato.</P><P>"Jeez Kate. If you wanted to see me naked all you had to do was ask."  She's chuckling. Of course, leave it to Beth to be totally…Beth…at a time like this. She's still laughing and I can't bring myself to turn around or to say anything.</P><P>I make a quick decision. "Uh…I'll just um…see ya downstairs!" I didn't give her a chance to reply. I tore out of my room and ran into the kitchen where my mom was reading the paper.</P><P>She looks up, "Whoa Kate, where's the fire?"</P><P>Oh boy, what do I say to her? Do I tell her? That doesn't seem like a good idea because she walked in on…whatever was going on between me and Beth last night. I'm just gonna play it cool. Yeah, sounds like a plan!</P><P>I look at her as innocently as I can. "I don't know what you mean, mom."</P><P>She laughs and shakes her head, "Okay honey, whatever you say. I actually have a date with a nice respectable man…so no calling this one Skip. Got it?"</P><P>Hell I'd agree with anything to get out of this awkward situation. "Sure mom. I swear I won't call him Skip." I smile that innocent smile as added reassurance.</P><P>"Okay. I'm gonna go. Tell Beth I said bye and I'll see you girls later." She leans down and kisses me on the head before leaving.</P><P>Good! At least I dodged that bullet for now but I could tell by the look she gave me, that this conversation will be brought up later. Joy! I can't wait for that. Wait a minute! If mom left that means it's just me and Beth. Shit! I forgot that I ran to my mom in order to escape the awkwardness. Now that she's gone I have nowhere to run.</P><P>"Sorry sweetie, I had to put clothes on…I know how much you like me without them." Speak of the devil and let the torture begin!</P><P>(Beth POV)</P><P>I feel so much better after taking a COLD shower. As fate would have it, right when I step out of the shower Kate walks in the bathroom. She quickly turns around because she's embarrassed but I'm not. The only thing I need right now is another COLD shower. I hear her apologize as she swiftly turns around. I can hear both of our breathing pick up and I'm really turned on.</P><P>After a painfully long awkward silence Kate makes an excuse and books it out of the bathroom. I'm plagued with thoughts that are anything but innocent as I get dressed.</P><P>I walk into the kitchen just in time to see Lori close the door. Kate has her back turned to me but I can totally read her body language…she is soooo stressed! In typical me fashion, I have to make the situation bend to my favor.</P><P>"Sorry sweetie, I had to put clothes on…I know how much you like me without them." She suddenly goes extremely stiff. I love torturing her.</P><P>She turns around. "My mom went on a date with the latest catch. What do you want to do today." Way to change the subject Kate, but I'll go along with it.</P><P>"I don't know. Carrie and Heather are still out of town and they won't be back until next week. And with the weather the way it is, I don't really feel like going out and doing anything. Wanna stay in and watch movies and stuff?" In all honesty there are a million things I want to do with her today. Things that involve no clothing and excessive contact. Okay Beth, seriously! Mind needs to get out of the gutter. Sometimes I swear I'm the president of Gutter Town.</P><P>She smiles and my knees go weak. "Sure. That sounds fun."</P><P>We ended up having a total movie marathon. I'm not sure what time it was when we finally fell asleep. Kate fell asleep before me. We were in the middle of a movie when I looked down and she was hugging my stomach, sound asleep. I smiled and shut the TV off. Then I put my arm around her and covered us up with a blanket. I was asleep instantly and I couldn't help but think that this felt so right, perfect even.</P><P>Around midnight Lori finally let herself in the house. She was being serious when she said that this guy was different. He was the perfect gentleman and he actually treated her like she was special, instead of an easy lay.</P><P>She couldn't help but smile when she looked over at the couch. Beth and her daughter were snuggled up to one another, sound asleep, with smiles on their faces. Lori made a quick decision and walked into her room. She emerged a couple of minutes later with her camera.  She took tons of pictures of the two and couldn't help but think that they made a perfect couple.</P><P>With how boy crazy Lori is a lot of people would think she would be against her daughter being gay. But to Lori, all that mattered was her daughters happiness and it had been clear since they moved that Beth made Kate happier than she had ever been. In that moment Lori decided that she would do whatever it took to make sure that Beth and her daughter ended up together!</P><P>An: Man I really love Lori in my story! Lol! So I'm not sure when the next chapter will be up cause of my dad but I do know that I have a million ideas for this story so it could be interesting! Talk to ya soon.</P>
