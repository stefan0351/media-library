<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 34: Family -->

<P>Seven wasn’t sure what had awakened her from a sound sleep, but she rolled
over and opened her eyes anyway. She glanced around the room, noticing the
candles on the nightstand and knew that she must have slept for a few hours. The
last thing she remembered after making love with B’Elanna was drifting off to
sleep while watching those same candles. They had now burned almost complete
away. Seven shifted her weight and rolled onto her back, smiling when B’Elanna
whined and tightened her grip around the blonde’s waist.</P>
<P>An unfamiliar sensation made Seven pause and put her hand on her belly, then
she grabbed B’Elanna’s arm and gently squeezed it.</P>
<P>"Lana, wake up," Seven said. She turned her head and looked at her wife.
B’Elanna’s eyes fluttered but didn’t open. "B’Elanna, wake up," Seven said a
little louder.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked as her eyes shot open. "What’s wrong?" She sat up and
stared down at Seven. "Are you okay? What’s wrong?" Her hair was tussled from
hours of lovemaking and her eyes were blurred, but she focused on Seven.</P>
<P>"Nothing is wrong," Seven said as she grabbed B’Elanna’s hand and moved it to
her stomach.</P>
<P>"Then why did you wake me up?" B’Elanna asked as she tried to slow her racing
heart. She wasn’t completely awake yet, and began settling down beside Seven.
"What was that?" B’Elanna asked as she pressed her hand closer to Seven’s
belly.</P>
<P>"That is why I woke you," Seven answered. She moved B’Elanna’s hand a few
inches to the left and pressed it against her skin. "There," Seven said with a
grin.</P>
<P>"She’s kicking," B’Elanna said. Her eyes widened and she shifted onto her
side and repositioned her hand. "Oh, my god, she’s kicking in there."</P>
<P>"Yes, she is." Seven nodded and laced her fingers over B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was overwhelmed and looked into Seven’s eyes. "That’s our daughter,"
she said quietly. "Thank you, for waking me," she added before she leaned over
and quickly kissed Seven. "Do you think she’s knows we’re here?" B’Elanna looked
back down toward Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"I doubt she has the cognitive ability at this point…" Seven began, then
smiled brightly. "But… I feel… yes, she does."</P>
<P>"I think so, too." B’Elanna laughed and crawled under the blankets and began
placing fleeting kisses on Seven’s stomach. Seven was wearing her blue
nightgown, having put it on in case she needed to get up during the night to
take care of Ty. B’Elanna’s kisses tickled Seven’s belly beneath the satiny
fabric. "Hey, little one, what are you doing up so late?" B’Elanna asked the
baby…or rather, Seven’s belly. "Don’t you know it’s the middle of the night,
wa’machwI,’?" she asked, calling the child <I>little one</I> in Klingon.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," Seven said indulgently, "she cannot see anything from her present
location. How could she know what time it is?"</P>
<P>"Oh, hush," B’Elanna said with a laugh and then growled at Seven. She gasped
when the baby kicked again.</P>
<P>"Apparently, she likes hearing her mother growl," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>B’Elanna raised an eyebrow and then began growling again. She put her mouth
directly onto Seven’s belly and continued growling. Seven squirmed.</P>
<P>"Hold still," B’Elanna ordered playfully and then growled onto Seven’s belly
again.</P>
<P>"It tickles," Seven said as she tried to pull B’Elanna’s face away from
her.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna said with mock harshness. "I’m bonding with my daughter." She
grabbed the blankets and covered her head and went back to her growling. "There
see? She likes it," B’Elanna said from under the blankets when the baby kicked
again. She began tickling Seven’s ribs. "Or maybe she likes to feel you
squirm."</P>
<P>"Stop," Seven said, but she was giggling, taking away the effect of her
complaint. </P>
<P>B’Elanna’s growls became louder from underneath the blankets. </P>
<P>Seven heard a muted hiss and turned in time to see Ty crawling into the room.
She gripped B’Elanna, trying to drag her out from under the covers.</P>
<P>"Bear?" Ty asked as he used the side of the bed to pull himself up. "Ba get
bad bear?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s head poked out from under the blankets. "Ty?" </P>
<P>"How did he know how to open the door?" Seven asked accusingly.</P>
<P>"Umm well… we were playing hide and seek earlier…and I may have showed him
how to open the door," B’Elanna said sheepishly.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said as she lifted Ty onto the bed. She smiled as he snuggled
down between his two aunts. "And if he had happened to have come in several
hours ago?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Well…he didn’t," B’Elanna pointed out.</P>
<P>"My Ba," Ty said as he tugged at B’Elanna’s arm. He wanted her up on the
pillow where she belonged. She moved up, wrapping her arm over Ty and resting
her palm on Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"My Ba," Seven whispered as she stretched out and kissed B’Elanna’s forehead.
</P>
<P>"Evan, ing… peaz," Ty asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said. "<I>Evan</I>… sing…please."</P>
<P>Seven rolled her eyes and looked over at her wife. "What would you like me to
sing?"</P>
<P>"Cowboy zong," Ty answered as he sat up.</P>
<P>B’Elanna groaned and covered her head with the pillow. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway entered the mess hall, pausing to smile and wave hello to the
crewmembers having breakfast. She saw Nara and Tach sitting with Neelix and
headed over to them.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Nara said as the captain neared the table. "How are you
feeling?"</P>
<P>"Much better, thank you," Janeway responded. "Mind if I join you?"</P>
<P>"Please," Tach said with a smile.</P>
<P>"Oh, yes, Captain," Neelix chimed in and then stood. "Let me get you some
coffee."</P>
<P>"You’re a lifesaver, Mister Neelix," Janeway said as she settled onto the low
bench.</P>
<P>"I’m glad you joined us," Nara said as soon as Neelix disappeared. "There is
something we need to ask you."</P>
<P>"Of course," Janeway said. "What can I do for you?"</P>
<P>Nara looked to Tach. He nodded and cleared his throat.</P>
<P>"We would like to ask B’Elanna and Seven something, but we thought we should
ask you first," he explained.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Janeway asked. She had the distinct feeling she wasn’t going to
like the question.</P>
<P>"Well, you know we care very much for them both," Nara said as she leaned
forward. "And Ty adores them."</P>
<P>"Yes…" Janeway nodded.</P>
<P>"Well," Nara continued. "Tach’s brother had a settlement next to ours, but he
wasn’t…cut out for farming. He gave it to us. We would like to offer it to
B’Elanna and Seven."</P>
<P>"I see," Janeway responded carefully. "That decision is up to them," she
added, though she hoped they would choose to stay. Not only were both women
valuable members of the crew, they were also close friends.</P>
<P>"Well, we thought we should clear it with you first," Tach said.</P>
<P>"I appreciate that," Janeway said. "But I would never keep them from
something they want. I will, however, say that I hope they stay on board. I’d
hate to lose them."</P>
<P>"Mama," Ty yelled as B’Elanna carried him into the mess hall.</P>
<P>Nara looked up and smiled. "Come here, you," she said as she held up her
arms. B’Elanna moved toward her. A few moments later Seven came into the room
holding Naomi Wildman’s hand.</P>
<P>"Good morning," B’Elanna handed Ty to his mother.</P>
<P>"How did you sleep?" Tach asked his son.</P>
<P>"Ba and Evan played bear," Ty volunteered.</P>
<P>"Played bear?" Naomi asked as she sat next to Nara.</P>
<P>"How are you, Naomi?" Nara pulled Naomi closer.</P>
<P>"Ba got Evan," Ty said. He reached out grabbed a nearby fork and Nara
struggled to take it away from him.</P>
<P>"Yes, my son," Nara said with a wicked grin. "Ba tends to do that."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna was feeling the baby move," Seven clarified. Her face was as red as
Janeway had ever seen it. </P>
<P>"She kicked for the first time last night," B’Elanna added as she sat next to
her wife and rested a hand on Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"You shouldn’t kick your wife," Tach told Seven, his eyes sparkling
mischievously.</P>
<P>"The baby kicked," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Of course it did," Nara said.</P>
<P>"Of course," Janeway added.</P>
<P>"Uh huh," Tach said.</P>
<P>"She was playing with the baby," Seven insisted.</P>
<P>"Of course she was," Nara said.</P>
<P>Seven was beginning to whither under the embarrassing scrutiny when the baby
kicked as if on cue. She smiled and looked at B’Elanna who had also felt it.</P>
<P>"I think that’s even harder than it was last night," B’Elanna said as she
looked down at Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said. "I believe she gets her temperament from you," she told
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna whined, but smiled.</P>
<P>"Can I feel?" Naomi asked.</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said. "Come over here next to me." She guided Naomi’s hand
to her belly and pressed her tiny fingers against her stomach.</P>
<P>"I don’t feel anything," Naomi said.</P>
<P>"Just wait a second, Squirt," B’Elanna said. She edged Naomi’s hand toward
her.</P>
<P>"Wow," Naomi said when she felt the flutter under her fingers.</P>
<P>Neelix returned with the captain’s coffee and saw the commotion. He handed
Janeway her mug and knelt next to Naomi. "May I?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded and leaned back to give the furry chef access to her belly. From
there, a small crowd gathered, eager to feel the tiny kicks. Janeway stayed
seated, not wanting to interfere, and also not quite ready to be that involved
with the reality of the pregnancy. It was one thing to be happy for the couple,
but it was something else all together to rest her hand on the belly of the
woman she still had some unresolved feelings for.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Later that afternoon, B’Elanna insisted that Seven go for a check up with the
Doctor. She wasn’t taking any chances with her wife or daughter’s health. She
wanted Seven to have daily check ups until the Doctor assured her that Seven was
out of danger.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I do not wish to see…him," Seven said coldly. She paused in the corridor,
trying to convince B’Elanna to let her visit with Nara and Tach instead of
seeing the hologram who had tried to terminate her pregnancy.</P>
<P>"I know, love," B’Elanna said as she took Seven’s hand. "I’m not too thrilled
with him either, but what choice do we have? You need medical attention. I’ll be
with you the whole time."</P>
<P>"All right." Seven nodded and gripped her wife’s hand as they neared the door
to sickbay.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Doctor turned when the doors to sickbay opened. "Seven, are you ill?" he
asked.</P>
<P>"No," she said coldly.</P>
<P>"I thought she should have a check up, just to make sure she’s still okay,"
B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>"I take it you are not thrilled with the idea?" he asked Seven.</P>
<P>"Thrilled is the last thing I am," the exdrone stated. "But I have no other
option."</P>
<P>"Actually," he said quietly. "Thanks to Mister Kim and I, you do have another
option."</P>
<P>"Explain," Seven said. She pulled B’Elanna closer to her side.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Less than a half-hour later, Seven and B’Elanna were in the holodeck staring
at Doctor Opaca.</P>
<P>"Seven, it’s wonderful to meet you," Opaca said. "And you B’Elanna, I’ve
heard a great deal about you." She motioned for Seven to move onto the biobed.
Harry had programmed a medical bay into the holodeck because he didn’t think
Seven wanted to be anywhere near the Doctor for the time being. "Are you having
any pain?" Opaca asked as Seven sat on the examination bed.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She glanced over at B’Elanna and smirked almost
imperceptibly. "My wife wanted to be certain that I did not have a relapse."</P>
<P>"Not likely, given the nature of your problem," Opaca said. She looked over
at B’Elanna and smiled. Her nose ridges crinkled and her eyes sparkled warmly.
"But it is perfectly normal for a first time mother to be nervous."</P>
<P>"Excuse me," Seven said as she tilted her head to one side. "But how do I
know that you will not make the same decisions as the Doctor?"</P>
<P>Opaca nodded and stepped back. "Because, my matrix is based on a Bajorian
physician. They value the patient’s beliefs and wishes above all else. I am also
versed in Starfleet medical ethics, which prohibit me from taking any action you
forbid, additionally, Mister Kim added a subroutine that will not allow me to
ignore either of those qualifying factors."</P>
<P>"What do you think about that, Doctor?" B’Elanna asked. She stood next to
Seven, her hand resting on the former Borg’s knee.</P>
<P>"I don’t think it is necessary, but it doesn’t bother me," Opaca said. "I
find the Doctor’s actions reprehensible. You should never have been put in the
situation to fight your doctor for the life of your child."</P>
<P>"Pleasant words," Seven said carefully. "But I will reserve judgment until I
get to know you better."</P>
<P>"A wise choice," Opaca said with a smile. "I suggest that you examine the
matrix parameters. It might help you feel more secure."</P>
<P>"I intend to," Seven responded.</P>
<P>"Now, let’s have a look at you," Opaca said as she began scanning Seven.
"Hmm, very good." She moved her tricorder to Seven’s belly. "Yes, you are
healing very nicely. Any pain from the muscle tears?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "Not since last night."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s hand squeezed Seven’s knee reassuringly.</P>
<P>"Good," Opaca said. "I don’t see any problems. Do you have any questions?"
She put the tricorder down and turned to Seven and waited patiently.</P>
<P>"The baby started kicking last night," B’Elanna volunteered.</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said. "With the temporal variance, the pregnancy has advanced to
the equivalent of the fifth month. She should be moving quite a bit."</P>
<P>"I have a question," Seven said. She looked expectantly at Opaca. "I was not
comfortable speaking with the Doctor about it, but I feel…compelled to find
out."</P>
<P>"Of course, what is it?" Opaca asked. She rested her hand on her chin and
listened intently.</P>
<P>"I was uncertain as to how… enthusiastic I could be when making love with
B’Elanna," Seven explained. "Last night, given my injuries, we limited my
activities to those of performing acts on my wife."</P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna exclaimed.</P>
<P>Opaca laughed a deep and heartfelt sound. "My dear, a healthy sexual life is
imperative to emotional health," she assured B’Elanna. "There’s nothing about
Seven’s condition that should limit her love making."</P>
<P>"But," B’Elanna blushed deeply. "What about…well… you know… the baby is
getting bigger. I don’t want to injure her."</P>
<P>"I assure you, B’Elanna, you won’t poke out your daughter’s eye with normal
penetration," Opaca stated. </P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened and her blush deepened. </P>
<P>"Normal?" Seven asked curiously. "What is considered normal?"</P>
<P>"Oh, geeze," B’Elanna said as she covered her face with her hands.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna spent the next half-hour standing off to the side as Opaca and Seven
had a detailed conversation about every aspect of sex. B’Elanna thought her
skin’s ability to blush was going to wear out. When Opaca told Seven that she
should be careful when using toys, the exdrone was thoroughly confused. Opaca
then asked if they utilized toys, Seven was still stymied, so she turned to her
wife.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, what are these toys?" she asked.</P>
<P>"You know what?" B’Elanna asked as she turned around and faced Seven. "This
is not a conversation I want to be having with Opaca the sex therapist."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Opaca said with a smile, "There is nothing to be embarrassed
about. Many women utilize toys during their lovemaking."</P>
<P>"What kind of toys?" Seven asked. She wondered how any of the toys she had
seen could be used sexually. Certainly Samantha Wildman would not give Naomi
sexual aids to play with.</P>
<P>B’Elanna seemed to read Seven’s mind and she laughed. "Be’nal, not the toys
you are thinking about. We’re talking about artificial…umm… synthetic…no, umm…
<I>things</I> for penetration."</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven said, suddenly understanding. "You mean dildoes? Why did you not
just say so? I have researched various sexual aids, however I did not feel we
needed them."</P>
<P>B’Elanna wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear. Her wife had no modesty.
"Yes, dildoes," she said. "I personally find the idea of using some… fake… piece
of technology to make love… rather impersonal."</P>
<P>"What do you call this?" Seven asked as she held up her left hand to B’Elanna
and wiggled her fingers. </P>
<P>"I…umm." B’Elanna found out that she could blush a few shades deeper.</P>
<P>"I read in your medical files that the entire arm from the elbow down has
been replaced," Opaca said as she moved closer to the exdrone. "What exactly can
your prosthetic hand do?"</P>
<P>"None of your business." B’Elanna stepped in front of the small hologram. The
Klingon suddenly wished the warp core would breech, something, anything to get
her out of her current conversation.</P>
<P>"I’m a doctor...my interest is purely scientific," Opaca assured her.</P>
<P>"Well, go study some spores and leave my wife out of it!" B’Elanna turned and
moved over to Seven. "Can we go home now, please," she asked her wife.</P>
<P>"Were you exposed to the pheromones?" Opaca asked as she began scanning
B’Elanna. Seven smirked, but then covered her mouth to avoid laughing.</P>
<P>"No," Seven explained. "Lana is Klingon. Passion, possessiveness, and
aggressive behavior are all standard for her species… That is why I married
her."</P>
<P>"That’s it," B’Elanna said. "We’re leaving. Now." She took Seven’s hand and
pulled her toward the exit.</P>
<P>"I am familiar with Klingons," Opaca said with a smirk as they moved toward
the exit. "If you have anymore questions, just ask."</P>
<P>"End program," B’Elanna said. She released a long sigh when the black and
yellow grid appeared.</P>
<P>"That was rude," Seven pointed out. "She was still talking."</P>
<P>"I just wish I had thought of it a half hour ago." B’Elanna stopped and
turned to look up at Seven. "I think you enjoyed embarrassing me."</P>
<P>"Why does the topic of sex embarrass you?" Seven asked, genuinely
confused.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stopped and took both of Seven’s hands in hers. "It doesn’t, with
you. Our sex life is our business, and no one else’s. And yes, I get embarrassed
when you talk in such graphic detail with someone."</P>
<P>"But, I did not discuss what we do," Seven said as she tilted her head to the
side. "I only asked hypothetical questions, so that I would know what we can and
cannot do." Seven squeezed B’Elanna’s hands and then brought them up to her lips
and kissed her knuckles. "I want to make love to you, my Lana… but I don’t want
to endanger our child."</P>
<P>"I know," B’Elanna said as she leaned forward and rested her forehead onto
Seven’s chest. She wrapped her arms around Seven and squeezed her gently. "I
just don’t like sharing that aspect of our life with anyone."</P>
<P>"I will gladly refrain from discussing these matters," Seven said quietly,
"If you will promise me that you will ask the relevant questions of our
physician."</P>
<P>"Oh…I." B’Elanna closed her eyes and sighed. "Okay, but don’t you dare give
me a list of… interesting questions to ask that little…doctor," B’Elanna
said.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said as she pulled away and guided B’Elanna toward the
door. "I believe she already answered most of my questions."</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna said quietly as she stopped. "You can always ask me if
you’re curious."</P>
<P>Seven blushed, which confused B’Elanna, given the exdrone’s earlier candor.
"My questions to you generally involve actions I wish to…experience. My
questions to Opaca were as to the safety of our activities."</P>
<P>"Good point," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven. </P>
<P>Seven moaned, and completely forgot about the Bajorian hologram.</P>
