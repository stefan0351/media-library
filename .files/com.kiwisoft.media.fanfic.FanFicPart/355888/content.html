<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 6: Your Little Secret -->

<p>Joey broke into a run when she saw Kaela crying. She had always been at least half joking when she talked about hating Pacey, but now she was going to cut him dead. "You asshole," she hissed, "you're not going to live to see the sunrise." She put her arm protectively over Kaela's shoulder and pulled her away, before either she or Pacey had a chance to respond. Dawson just stood there dumbstruck, feeling as if he'd just been caught in the eye of a storm. He looked at Pacey incredulously.</p>
		<p>"Hey, man, don't give me that look! You know I didn't do anything to her, Jesus!" Pacey said with a look of disgust, thinking that his best friend actually thought he might try to force himself on a girl.</p>
		<p>"I wasn't thinking that, Pacey," Dawson shot back defensively. "It was just a weird situation. Ideally, no one cries on a first date."</p>
		<p>"Fuck you," Pacey muttered, getting up to leave.</p>
		<p>"Pacey, wait a second." Dawson grabbed his arm and sat him back down. "I'm sorry, that was really rude. Tell me what happened, I know you'd never do anything like that."</p>
		<p>Pacey sighed, trying tiredly to think of some sort of quasi-lie that might serve as cover for the girl he was hot for, who was hot for the last girl he'd been hot for...he couldn't think too clearly.</p>
		<p>"We were just talking, Dawson, and she got upset about something I'm not at liberty to disclose."</p>
		<p>"Oh really?" Dawson's eyebrows went up suspiciously, as he ran down a mental list of what those things might have been.</p>
		<p>"Yes, really. Look, if it were about me, I'd tell you in a second, but it's totally none of your business, or mine either, if you come right down to it, so I'd say we better just drop it."</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay, sheesh," Dawson sighed dissapointedly. "...but did you kiss her?" A grin was creeping over Dawson's face.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Kaela, shit, I'm so sorry, I said I wouldn't leave you alone..." Joey's voice trailed off as she sat her friend down on the grass by the riverbed, stroking her hair as she hugged her. "I swear I'll kill him," she whispered as Kaela's tears quieted. She pulled back to look in her friend's eyes, assessing the damage. The fear she saw almost blew her mind.</p>
		<p>"Pacey didn't do anything, Jo," Kaela whispered as she tried to catch her breath. Joey was running her fingers though the hair at the back of Kaela's neck, softly, and Kaela wished for a moment that she could just sit there all night without having to say anything, or explain anything, and just stay safe and warm in Joey's quiet affection. But of course, silence wouldn't cut it for much longer.</p>
		<p>"What happened, Sweetheart?" Joey asked gently. Kaela looked at her for a moment, and then back down at the ground, her heart racing. She felt like a deer caught in headlights. A dozen fabrications flew to mind, perfectly good reasons she could be crying, but she knew she'd never be able to lie to Joey. She wanted to say it, she was dying to, she could even hear herself saying it.</p>
		<p>"I...God, Jo, I can't tell you." Her eyes filled with fresh tears as she spoke, watching Joey's face fall in an expression of deep hurt.</p>
		<p>"You can tell me anything, Kaela, you know that." Joey's own heart began to beat a little faster as the air around her seemed to get thicker. There was something tingling all around them, as if the whole world might shatter at the hugeness of what was coming. But what it was, Joey had absolutely no idea.</p>
		<p>"Anything but this, Joey," Kaela said shakily, hating herself as the words fell from her lips. "I'm sorry, I want to so much...but not now, I just can't."</p>
		<p>Joey nodded, and wrapped her arms around Kaela's bent frame fiercely, hugging her close until the tears melted into even breaths. Kaela put her head down on Joey's shoulder, letting herself be comforted as the sensation of being trampled set in on her. She took in a deep breath, breathing Joey in without really meaning to. Her hair smelled so good. She was so far away from safety, a million miles from where she wanted to be, but for a few silent moments, she could at least pretend the world was how she wanted it.</p>
		<p>"Wanna go get some coffee before we go home?" Joey asked quietly, disentangling herself slowly from the moment that hadn't quite been.</p>
		<p>"Yeah," Kaela sighed while she dried her eyes, sniffling as she made her way back to reality. They went back over to where they'd left the boys, who were looking a little less bewildered than they were.</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Pace," Joey said quickly, and Pacey nodded, but Joey wasn't even really looking. The awkwardness hung over them all faintly, like mist, until they entered the coffee shop. Once they had ordered, they realized they were back among a large group of teenagers, almost just like if they were hanging out at the Icehouse, and they all relaxed a little. They got their drinks to go, and once they were served, they headed back towards the truck. Pacey tried to keep Kaela's spirits light, telling dumb jokes and cracking on weird people they saw walking by. It seemed to work a little; she laughed a few times, at least, and the smile she usually wore wouldn't be held back much longer. It was a bit more reserved than her normal smile, but it was better than nothing.</p>
		<p>Joey, meanwhile, was desperate to understand what had just happened. A million possibilities ran through her head, but nothing that really made sense...and what on God's green earth could Kaela tell *Pacey* that she couldn't tell her? They barely even knew each other. Joey's instinct was to feel hurt, and a little rejected, but she couldn't keep feeling that way with Kaela holding onto her hand for dear life. She's not mad at you, Joey said to herself over and over. It's okay, she'll tell you when she's ready. As they all climbed into the truck, Joey leaned over and tucked a lock of hair behind Kaela's ear, kissing her forehead. Kaela didn't respond, but smiled a little. Joey sighed and put her head down on Dawson's shoulder, suddenly feeling very tired.</p>
		<p>"Joey, we're home." Dawson's voice in her ear was the first clue Joey had that she'd been asleep the entire trip back. Dazed, she looked up quickly, for a moment having no memory of the night's events, only a vague apprehension.</p>
		<p>"What time is it?" she asked foggily.</p>
		<p>"Quarter to one," Pacey said looking at his watch. "you're safe."</p>
		<p>She nodded, opening the door, and slid off Dawson's lap onto the less welcoming ground. Dawson got out next so that Kaela could get out, too, since she was sleeping at Joey's. For a moment, Pacey and Kaela were alone in the truck's cabin.</p>
		<p>"You gonna be okay tonight?" Pacey whispered to her, taking her hand protectively.</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Pacey, I'm scared," she admitted shakily.</p>
		<p>"Look, you can come stay at my house if you want, it'll give you some time to clear your head and get things together before you decide how you're going to handle this."</p>
		<p>"That's really nice of you to offer, but I can't bail on her now...you weren't there when we talked, it was...really, really intense, and if I leave now she's going to think I'm ditching her or something, I owe her more than that." Kaela bit her lip as she thought of how much harder it would be to keep her cool once she and Joey were alone.</p>
		<p>"Okay," Pacey sighed, "you know where I am if you need me." Kaela nodded and hugged him quickly, before slipping out of the safety of the truck, tentatively walking over to the front step where Joey stood waiting.</p>
		<p>Bessie, of course, was still awake when they walked in. "Hey," she said wearily, "so where'd you go?"</p>
		<p>"Providence," Joey said absently, hoping to keep the conversation to a minimum.</p>
		<p>"Neat, to the festival I bet. Was it fun?"</p>
		<p>"Mm-hmm. We're exhausted, though, so we'll see you in the morning, okay Bess?" Joey gave her sister a quick kiss on the cheek and, without waiting for a reply, took Kaela's hand and led her down the hall to her room. They changed silently into their pajamas, both with a million questions of the tip of their tongues but both afraid to speak first. Finally, when there was nothing left to do, Joey sat down on the bed and crossed her legs, bracing herself for-- what? "So are we going to talk?"</p>
		<p>Kaela felt her stomach do a few calisthenics, tugging on her hair before she could think of a reply. She crept to the edge of the bed and sat down cautiously, looking down at her hands.</p>
		<p>"I have no idea what I'm doing here, Jo...I just don't want to ruin everything."</p>
		<p>"Kaela, nothing you could say could ruin everything. You're my friend, I love you, whatever it is." Joey began to feel like she wasn't even in the room anymore, but watching from above, or on a TV screen. Yes, that's exactly what it was, another one of Dawson's convoluted screenplays, only this time Dawson wasn't calling the shots.</p>
		<p>Kaela felt the tears behind her eyes pressing to be let out, and she knew the next time she opened her mouth, there would be no stopping them. She breathed in a few very slow, deliberate breaths, and after a moment of cloudiness she regained control. On a whim, she reached over to Joey's desk and picked up the heavy volume of Spanish poetry the two of them had used in their presentation. Opening it, she flipped the pages tensely, having no idea what it was she was looking for until she got to it.</p>
		<i>
		<p>"Entre lo que veo y digo,</p>
		<p>entre lo que digo y callo,</p>
		<p>entre lo que callo y sueño,</p>
		<p>entre lo que sueño y olvido,</p>
		<p>la poesía."</p>
		</i>
		<p>She read it aloud quietly, not quite realizing she was using the poem to try to explain herself. Subtext seemed to be the only place where she was safe. Joey put her hand over Kaela's and closed the book, watching her tears fall on the heavy cloth cover.</p>
		<p>"Please, talk to me." Joey's eyes hunted for a sign, any sign, that she was getting somewhere. Kaela kept her eyes averted, her lip trembling as if she were holding in a scream.</p>
		<p>"I want to talk to you, Joey, I just...shit, why can't I do this? The only thing I want to do is say this to you." She finally met Joey's gaze; her crooked glance filled with love and concern almost broke Kaela's heart.</p>
		<p>"Okay," Joey said decisively, "this is what we're going to do. I'm getting up to go wash my face, and you sit here and take a minute to breathe. When I get back, you can tell me."</p>
		<p>Without waiting for confirmation, Joey quickly got up and left the room, leaving Kaela with no choice but to gather her strength. All she could think was that these were going to be the last five minutes of their friendship, Joey was about to hate her forever. She thought of all the innocent times Joey had hugged her from behind and played with her hair, having no idea the power she had, what she was doing to her. It has to stop now, Kaela told herself, beginning to feel terribly nauseous. She couldn't keep going like this, Pacey was right, it was consuming her. She couldn't write one more poem, couldn't spend one more night crying, she'd just splatter all over the room or throw herself against a brick wall.</p>
		<p>Joey spent longer than necessary scrubbing her face, feeling a heavy knot forming in her own stomach. Her usual ability to critically analyze any situation had vaporized into a vague, electric energy of certainty that something big was happening, something so big she was afraid to say it for fear that the very words would slice her throat to ribbons, wrap around her lungs until the whole world crashed down on her. Breathe, she told herself. Just breathe. Her face bright pink (from scrubbing, of course), Joey hesitantly pushed the bedroom door open, finding Kaela in the exact same position she'd left her in, knees pulled up as if she were being attacked, on the edge of the bed. Joey didn't say anything, just sat down next to her and put one hand gently on her cheek, looking unwaveringly into her clear blue eyes. Kaela pulled her eyes up to meet Joey's, still trembling. She saw herself at the edge of a cliff, looking over, toes right at the edge. One tiny shift in her weight would send her down, no going back. No more thinking, she just had to let herself fall. Without giving herself a moment to reconsider, she leaned in and kissed Joey on the mouth. For maybe half a second, Joey's fingers stayed on her cheek, her lips accepting, almost welcoming. Maybe only a quarter of a second. Then she jumped back in surprise, and Kaela felt herself hit the ground. She burst into tears and jumped up quickly, grabbing her shoes and her jacket.</p>
		<p>"Fuck, I'm so sorry, Joey, I'm so sorry..." her voice trailed off into a few broken sobs, and Joey, for a critical moment, couldn't remember how to think, and didn't move.</p>
		<p>"Kaela, wait a second!" But she was already out the bedroom door, going nowhere, anywhere. Without stopping to put on her own shoes or jacket, Joey ran after her. Kaela was out of the house in a flash, running blindly towards the road. She couldn't catch her breath, though, she was crying so hard, and Joey caught up with her, grabbing her arm. She yanked it away as if she'd been bitten, and then sunk to the ground in a daze of bitter tears. Joey swallowed her own terror and kneeled down next to her, hugging her tightly.</p>
		<p>"Don't be sorry, don't ever be sorry," Joey whispered fiercely as the buzzing energy that had charged them both all night began to leak away, leaving them weak, spent. They didn't speak for almost fifteen minutes, and they both felt so drained they might have stayed outside all night if it weren't biting cold. Joey got up first, the cold hitting her full-force as she pulled herself away from Kaela's body heat. "C'mon," she said softly, tugging Kaela to her feet. They walked slowly back to the house, as if in a daze, without looking at each other.</p>
