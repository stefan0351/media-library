<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 2: Girl Talk in a Boy's Town -->

<p>"Are you sure you're warm enough?" Dawson asked as he and Joey left the school building, headed towards his house. "Maybe you should take my jacket."</p>
		<p>"For god's sake, Dawson, will you please relax? I'm fine." Joey rolled her eyes at Dawson's grandfatherly vigilance, which she had been trying to ignore all day.</p>
		<p>"You're not fine, Jo, you've been coughing all day. Maybe you shouldn't have come back to school yet--"</p>
		<p>"Dawson, I was out all last week. I'm fine. A little leftover cough is nothing to worry about, my throat's just irritated now. It'll clear up in a couple of days, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay, I just don't want you to push yourself too hard, that's all," he finished lamely, putting his arm around her shoulder protectively. She was about to remark that it seemed like his idea of pushing herself too hard was waking up every morning, but she sneezed instead.</p>
		<p>"Bless you," Dawson said with a hint of sarcasm, giving her his 'I told you so' look.</p>
		<p>"Dawson, you've got to get a grip. I don't freak out every time you sneeze!"</p>
		<p>"Well I'm not the one who had a hundred-and-three degree fever last week!"</p>
		<p>She pushed his arm off her shoulder and dropped her backpack on the grass in utter exasperation. "You know, you're acting like you think you're my father or something. Please, Dawson, I can take care of myself just fine! You're driving me nuts! Okay?" She folded her arms over her chest and stood her ground, studying his face for some sign that she had gotten through to him.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Joey....that's not what I meant to do, it was just...you really scared me last week, you know?" Her frown softened, and she almost regretted her harsh tone.</p>
		<p>"I know, Dawson, and it makes me feel so special and so safe to know you're always looking out for me like that, but you've got to let it go. Trust me that I know my needs better than you do. I've always been prone to fevers, they're not so abnormal, you know. Hell, I get a hundred degree fever every time I get my period!" Then she blushed and picked up her backpack, resuming their walk at a slightly brisker pace.</p>
		<p>"...Every month, Jo? That's...I mean that sounds crazy." Dawson began to redden a little, too, but he resolved not to let it close him up. After all, he should be able to talk about these things with Joey if they were ever going to...</p>
		<p>"it's not crazy at all, Dawson, it's pretty common for girls. I mean not for the whole week, just the first night or so. And it's not every month." Neither of them seemed to know what to say after that, and they walked a while in silence, eyes turned towards the few budding flowers, or the scant crowd of early returning birds swooping from their trees. Dawson realized there were things about Joey he'd never even thought about...things he'd never think to think about.</p>
		<p>"Joey?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"How old were you when you first..." he began to falter, but toughened his resolve-- "when you first got your period?"</p>
		<p>He thought he saw her stiffen out of the corner of his eye, but he pretended not to notice.</p>
		<p>"Why'd you ask that?" she said cautiously.</p>
		<p>"Just curious...I mean I guess it's something I never thought about before." Joey didn't say anything for a moment, and he regretted bringing it up.</p>
		<p>"Twelve," she said finally, a little whimsically, Dawson thought. "It was November of seventh grade. I went to the nurse's office to get a pad because-- because in the girls' room they only had tampons, and I was scared to try, and when I opened the drawer and took one, Cherie Savageaux walked in and saw me, god she was such a damn blabbermouth, and I was so embarrassed, I knew she'd tell everyone." Joey kept her eyes focused on the ground ahead of her.</p>
		<p>"...But she didn't," Dawson added after a moment of silence.</p>
		<p>"Of course she did. I was mortified."</p>
		<p>"But I don't remember anything about that," Dawson said, confused.</p>
		<p>"Well, you weren't involved."</p>
		<p>"But you just said she told everyone."</p>
		<p>"She did-- all the girls, I guess I meant to say. Girls can be such vultures, Dawson. Especially at that age. They're just so...brutal to each other." She finally looked over at him, and he thought he saw traces of the memory in the line of her face, the way her eyes trembled slightly. He nodded, not knowing what else to do. He wanted to kiss her, at that moment, to show her what he was feeling, but somehow he felt he had tread too closely on territory where he had no right, so he kept on walking. Joey sensed him pulling away, and she shook off her momentary vulnerability as easily as she could, trying not to feel sad that he didn't understand or care for such matters as these.</p>
		<p>"Anyway, every girl's got a story like that. Either you got it too soon or you got it too late, or your bra was too noticeable or else it wasn't noticeable enough." She laughed and shook her head, ironically at first, but then she developed an expansive, dopey grin, and seemed to be remembering something precious. Dawson's fear of butting too far into her personal space was still nagging him, but he desperately wanted to know every thought and feeling she was having, every feeling she'd ever had, everything there was to see or know inside her, and it got the better of him.</p>
		<p>"What's so funny, Jo?"</p>
		<p>"I was just remembering...a few months after that, spring of seventh grade, I guess, the thing I wanted most in the world was a red bra. Not just any red, either, I mean blood red. Crimson. The most intense red that fabric can be dyed."</p>
		<p>Dawson bit his lip and tried not to let the image enter his head, but he couldn't stop it. Joey in silky red underwear, leaning back against the wall, watching him stare at her, waiting for him to come closer...</p>
		<p>He cleared his throat loudly, scratching the back of his neck. "Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah, I was fixated on it. I was just so sick of white and beige...beige is such an ugly color. But Bessie was adamantly against it. She said when I was changing for gym and all the other girls saw it, they'd think I was a slut or something." She laughed out loud, forgetting her embarrassment in discussing these things with Dawson. "That was half the point! If they thought I was a slut, at least that meant they'd think I was sexy...I just wanted to feel sexy."</p>
		<p>All the embarrassment that Joey had thrown off, Dawson had immediately absorbed. He began to fidget with his jacket zipper, trying desperately to continue walking normally with these images of her floating through his eager thoughts. If Joey noticed, she didn't let on.</p>
		<p>"...Anyway, Bessie gave in eventually. She had to, I just wouldn't shut up about it. God I loved that bra." She finally looked up from her privately screened memories, and saw Dawson looking at her like a dog in heat. Except that only females could go into heat. There wasn't really a word for it in males. She looked around quickly to see if there were any people nearby.</p>
		<p>She was lucky there weren't, because she didn't have the will power to stop him either way. He pushed her up against the tree she'd been walking past, and kissed her deeply. She kissed him back with equal ardor, her hands going into his hair, pressing her body closer to him. He put one hand on her waist, inside her jacket, and the other on her cheek, eagerly enjoying her soft skin. He moved down to her neck, and she leaned her head back against the rough bark in utter oblivion to its harsh texture, letting out a sigh of pleasure. Then she heard another sound-- as one might make when startled or caught off guard-- and it hadn't come from Dawson.</p>
		<p>"Pacey!" she shrieked, yanking herself out of Dawson's arms like a startled forest creature. Dawson, for his part, would've been more than eager to dismember his chuckling friend right then and there, if only he'd had the proper tools.</p>
		<p>"Hey, guys, I deeply and humbly apologize; believe me, this is not something I'm exactly eager to see. Just forget it happened." Pacey attempted not to grin as Joey buttoned up her jacket, her back turned to both of them while she tried desperately to stop blushing.</p>
		<p>"What the hell were you doing, Pacey?" Dawson demanded hotly, not sure of what his own proper protocol was at that moment.</p>
		<p>"Look, Dawson, I said I was sorry! I was just walking to your house since I missed you after school...I just wanted to see if you want to hang, maybe work on the truck, but I can see you've made other arrangements." With that, Pacey turned on his heels and marched away, not even attempting one of his obscene and humorless wisecracks. Dawson felt guilty for a moment-- after all, the guy had been sort of a helpless victim, really-- but the truth was he was far more eager to get back to Joey than he was to follow Pacey into town. He went over to where Joey stood, on the other side of the tree, and put his hand on her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"You okay?" he asked, trying to sound okay himself.</p>
		<p>"Shit, that was embarrassing...if it had been anyone else, it might have been okay..." she took a deep breath, and Dawson turned her around to face him.</p>
		<p>"Just forget it, like he said. I honestly think he feels worse than we do."</p>
		<p>"I sure hope so," Joey muttered ruefully, glancing at her feet. "C'mon, let's get going."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>The daylight was lingering longer and longer as the days ticked by toward spring, and the sun was only beginning to set when Joey left Dawson's house. As she climbed down the ladder, she noticed Jen sitting at the edge of the dock, where Joey usually left her little row boat. She didn't seem to be doing anything but looking out into the water. Joey stood behind her for a few moments, unsure whether she should just pass her without saying anything or interrupting her thoughts, or say hello. When she took her first step onto the wooden dock, Jen snapped around quickly, as if startled, and Joey could see her eyes were red.</p>
		<p>"Hey, you okay?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, Joey, I thought it-- yeah, I'm fine," she stammered, wiping her eyes on the back of her sleeve.</p>
		<p>"It's okay to talk if you want," Joey said cautiously, reminding herself that Jen had just lost her grandfather. "I mean, I've been there." Jen looked so surprised that Joey reddened and shifted her eyes down to clapboards beneath her feet.</p>
		<p>"Are you being nice to me?" Jen asked, attempting to make a joke but sounding more sarcastic than she meant to.</p>
		<p>"Hey, no skin off my back, it was just a thought." Joey quickly brushed past her and went to untie her boat.</p>
		<p>"No wait, Joey, that's not how I meant to-- I mean you never--" she bit her lip and her eyes welled up again, as she looked back out at the water. "Shit, I just can't speak English sometimes." Joey stopped and sat down next to her boat, trying to show Jen she was still willing to listen. Not being able to say what she meant was something she was well acquainted with.</p>
		<p>"I just wasn't expecting you to mean it," Jen said finally. "I mean I've tried so hard to be your friend, and the nicest thing you've ever said to me is that I don't look like a duck." Joey grinned sheepishly, holding in a thin wisp of laughter. She was ashamed of herself, of her behavior towards Jen in the past, but she'd always felt so-- trapped.</p>
		<p>"Well, I guess we could give it another try..." she offered quietly, hoping to redeem herself somewhat to the girl she'd had such animosity towards for so long. "I'm sorry you took so much shit from me, Jen, I know that sounds kind of hollow but I do mean it." Joey was looking down at her fingernails as she spoke, and she didn't notice Jen staring at her until she looked up.</p>
		<p>Jen was grinning mischievously, and Joey was suddenly paranoid, her wall going back up more quickly than it had come down. God damn it, was this some kind of joke?</p>
		<p>"What?" she demanded sharply.</p>
		<p>"Oh-- nothing," Jen said dismissively, her grin dissipating into a few mild chuckles.</p>
		<p>"Tell me why you're looking at me that way!" Joey reiterated, her fists clenched.</p>
		<p>"It's just...well, I can see you and Dawson had a good afternoon," she said suggestively. Joey's face burned with embarrassment; what did she mean by that? Had she been spying on them? Why hadn't they drawn the curtains?</p>
		<p>Jen realized after a moment of silence that Joey had no idea what she was talking about. Could it be she didn't even realize--? "Joey," she said slowly, "you know you've got a huge hickey on your neck." Joey's eyes widened in embarrassment and disbelief, and her hand went to her throat protectively. "There's nothing wrong with that," Jen added quickly. "I mean, it's normal! You should be proud of it."</p>
		<p>"Proud?" Joey squeaked. "I can't go home with this! I can't go to school with this! I can't believe Dawson didn't say anything..." her voice trailed off, as she realized he was probably embarrassed, too, maybe even more than she was, and not likely to mention any sexual injuries he might have unknowingly inflicted on her. She sat for a moment with her hand over her throat, her knees quickly pulled up to her chest and her eyes squeezed shut.</p>
		<p>"Look, Joey, it's really no big deal, but if it bothers you that much, why don't you come inside with me for a minute and I'll cover it up for you." Joey opened her eyes slowly, her eyebrows knit into a doubtful expression.</p>
		<p>"Really?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, I've done it a million times, c'mon," she said casually, getting up and holding out her hand to help Joey up. After a moment's hesitation, Joey took her hand and stood up, following Jen back to her grandmother's house.</p>
		<p>"Are you sure your grandmother won't draw blood if I go inside?" Joey asked awkwardly, trying to act as though she didn't care that Jen's grandmother thought she was a juvenile delinquent from the wrong side of the creek.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry, Grams has been pretty lenient ever since..." Jen's voice trailed off, and Joey inadvertently felt a pang of compassion.</p>
		<p>"It's okay," Joey said softly, putting her hand on Jen's shoulder. Jen looked away, her chin quivering for a moment. A tear slipped down her cheek and she quickly wiped it away with the back of her hand, then looked back at Joey, attempting a brave smile. Joey squeezed her shoulder, communicating her good intentions silently. Jen nodded, and they began to walk towards the house.</p>
		<p>Much to Joey's relief, they didn't even see Jen's grandmother on the way up to her room. The house had the smell of old age in it, and Joey felt, for a moment, grateful for her own home, which had the smell of babies and talcum powder. Jen's room was on the second floor, at the far end of the corridor. Joey realized, as she opened the door, that she was actually curious as to what Jen's room would be like. What she found wasn't at all what she had expected-- no frills, nothing pink, no posters of Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt. The walls were a simple, old flower print wall paper that Joey recognized from so many old, colonial houses in Capeside; the only poster was a Van Gough print of "Starry Night." There was a plain wooden dresser with a mirror above it, covered mostly by a clutter of school books and papers-- a lot like Joey's room.</p>
		<p>"This is nice," she remarked in a genuine tone.</p>
		<p>"Don't sound so shocked," Jen said, laughing. Joey looked down at her feet again, a little embarrassed, but laughing, too. "Okay, um, why don't you sit down in front of the dresser here, and I'll organize my makeup." Joey sat down and eyed Jen's bountiful makeup supply nervously. She felt completely out of her element here, just like she had when Jen had done her makeup for that dumb beauty pageant. But she swallowed the lump in her throat and promised herself she'd be good and sit through this nicely. After all, Jen was doing her a favor.</p>
		<p>Having gotten all her various compacts and tubes in order, Jen pulled up another chair in front of Joey's, and turned the desk light to face her. "Okay, now just tilt your head back and try not to move too much." Joey was about to comply but she turned her head quickly away from Jen and sneezed.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me," she said, sniffling.</p>
		<p>"You're still sick, huh?" Jen asked with a note of compassion in her voice.</p>
		<p>"Nah, this is just like the little mini-cold at the end that hangs on. It'll be gone in a day or two," Joey said carelessly as she took a tissue out of her pocket and blew her nose.</p>
		<p>"Well you sure had Dawson freaked out. He was convinced you were on your deathbed last week."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, he's been driving me nuts all day, acting like any minute I'm going to keel over or break in half. You'd think no one had ever had the flu before!" she sighed, grinning a little though she was trying hard not be amused by it.</p>
		<p>"You have no idea how much he loves you, do you?" Jen said suddenly. Joey looked up at her, startled, and then blushing. "...I'm sorry, Joey, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. It's true though. You have no idea the way he looks at you when you're walking away..." Jen looked down at her hands, and Joey realized that now that she had "the upper hand" with Jen, she didn't want it.</p>
		<p>"Can we just talk to each other like friends, Jen?" she asked suddenly. "I mean, for real, no strings attached. I don't want to do this dance around Dawson anymore with you, where we both tiptoe around on eggshells and don't trust each other. ...Do you think we can?" Jen was so shocked at Joey's directness, she didn't say anything for a minute. They both stopped fidgeting and looked each other in the eye, in their first attempt at an honest connection.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, Joey, I think we can." Jen grinned and Joey looked down again shyly, but smiling. "...So are we still doing this makeup thing, or what?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, yeah, absolutely," Joey said happily.</p>
		<p>"Good. Now I'm going to talk you through this so you'll be able to do it yourself next time..." they looked at each other and began to giggle. "Stop it, Jo, this is serious! Now you've got to start with a little green eye shadow to cancel out the red, and then it's best to use a layer of liquid foundation..</p>
