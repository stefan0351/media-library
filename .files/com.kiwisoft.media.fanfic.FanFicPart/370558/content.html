<p>Last Chapter! Enjoy!</p>
<p>Miley walked out first. She couldn't help but glance at Mikayla as she passed by her table. Angry eyes met her own. She walked quickly to her own table. Joannie was tapping her fingers impatiently.</p>
<p>"Took you long enough," she said.</p>
<p>"Crowded."</p>
<p>"Did you see her?" Mikayla hissed as Lilly returned to their table.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Miley! And Joannie is sitting right <i>there</i>," she whispered, motioning with her head behind them.</p>
<p>Lilly glanced over Mikayla' shoulder, watching as Miley and Joannie talked. "Yes, I saw her."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"And what?"</p>
<p>"What did she say? Why are they here?"</p>
<p>"Dinner?"</p>
<p>"You know what I mean? Jesus, I can't believe she slept with you and she's out again with Joannie. Has she no shame?"</p>
<p>Lilly closed her eyes. Shame? She was just kissing the woman minutes ago. Kissing Miley in a bathroom stall. When her date was <i>right</i> here! Shame? She was the one who had no shame.</p>
<p>"Lilly? Delivery," Jean said. Lilly looked up from her desk, her mouth dropping open. Flowers. Lots of flowers. Spring flowers this time.</p>
<p>"On your desk again?" Jean asked, setting the large vase on a corner.</p>
<p>"Thanks," she murmured. It only took a second for her office to fill again with women.</p>
<p>"Damn, Lilly. You must be good," one teased.</p>
<p>"Are they from the same person?"</p>
<p>"What's the occasion?"</p>
<p>"They're for sex, silly."</p>
<p>Lilly stood and pointed at her door. "Out! Get out."</p>
<p>They all left in a cloud of laughter and Lilly sunk back into her chair. Damn the woman. If Lilly could get her hands on her, she'd… what? Throttle her, she insisted. No, kiss her, most likely.</p>
<p>But they were beautiful. She reached out and touched a petal, conscious of the smile that crept onto her face. Her intercom buzzed.</p>
<p>"Line three. She wouldn't give a name," Jean told her.</p>
<p>"That's because she didn't think I'd take her call," Lilly murmured. Then she pushed line three. "Lilly Truscott."</p>
<p>"There's this woman that has this friend. A best friend. A little crazy, but still, a friend. And this woman is single. <i>Very</i> single. So the friend talks her into going to a bar on Valentine's Day. See, this friend likes this other woman. Likes her a lot, in fact. But this other woman, she told her they needed to date other women and not get serious. So, see, the best friend didn't know what to do. So, she thought, I'll make the other woman jealous and have her think that I'm dating this woman, the friend."</p>
<p>Lilly leaned back in her chair and stared at the ceiling, trying desperately to follow Miley's ramblings.</p>
<p>"There's a couple of problems. The friend, the woman, can't dance. So they look like idiots. And two, the woman, the friend, sees the most beautiful woman ever there at the bar. She's lost from just one look. She tells the friend. But the friend says, no, that's the woman I'm trying to make jealous. So the first woman is crushed, thinking that the beautiful blonde was taken. Then she finds out later that it's not the blonde her friend was trying to make jealous. It was the blonde's friend, a dark-haired woman."</p>
<p>Lilly had to cover her mouth to stifle a laugh.</p>
<p>"But see, the woman couldn't resist the blonde, so she asked her to dance, even though she can't dance. Oh, and my God, the kiss they shared was to die for. But the friend got mad, thinking that the blonde would tell the other woman if she knew that the friend was not really her date. So, the woman couldn't tell the blonde and the blonde thought she was dating the friend. When they weren't. Not ever. Not . . .."</p>
<p>"Please stop. My brain is going in circles trying to follow this." Lilly leaned her elbows on the table, and she smiled. Then she laughed. "Okay. In English this time, Miley. Please?"</p>
<p>"Joannie and Mikayla dated. Joannie liked her a lot. In fact, although she's not said this to me, I think she may be in love with Mikayla. But when Mikayla told her they were getting too serious, Joannie panicked. So, she talked me into going as her date to make Mikayla jealous. I saw you and… I forgot all about Joannie's plans. Even though Mikayla was your friend, I didn't care. But Joannie swore me to secrecy. She was afraid that if you knew the truth, you would tell Mikayla and Joannie would look like an idiot. And don't say it. I know she's an idiot to come up with this plan to begin with."</p>
<p>"When you said you could explain, you were kidding, right?"</p>
<p>"Lilly, please, it's the truth. You've got to believe me."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed. "Oh, I believe you. No sane person could possibly make up this story."</p>
<p>"So I'm not dating Joannie, I've not slept with her. That would just be gross. I'm single. I'm perfectly sane. I know we met at a bar and I know you have rules. But please, Lilly, give this a chance. I feel something when I'm with you. I think you feel it, too."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and smiled to her empty office. Yes, she felt it, too. "Write this down," Lilly instructed.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"10368 Skyline. Apartment 310. Six o'clock."</p>
<p>"Lilly?"</p>
<p>"Don't be late."</p>
<p>Lilly was still smiling and staring at her flowers when Mikayla knocked on the door and entered. "I heard you got flowers again," she said. "My God, the woman has balls. What is she thinking?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. "Sit down, Mikayla. Let's talk," she said.</p>
<p>"Talk? You're using that attorney voice. I don't like it when you do that. It scares me."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled. "I'm sorry. This is a friendly chat. Nothing more."</p>
<p>"Okay. What's up? And why the hell did she send you flowers again? Just because you saw her out with Joannie?"</p>
<p>"Do you like Joannie?"</p>
<p>"What? Yes, I like her. I told you that. But she's not exactly available."</p>
<p>"What if she was?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean? You're going to pretend to date Miley? Break Joannie's heart? So that she can run back to me? No. My God, she replaced me in a <i>week</i>!"</p>
<p>"You told her to replace you, if you remember," Lilly reminded her. "But I'm just asking, what if Joannie was available. Don't think about Miley. Just pretend Miley doesn't exist. If you had to do it over again, would you continue seeing Joannie?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"Maybe?"</p>
<p>"Yes. If I had to do it over again, if I hadn't freaked out, yes, I would continue seeing her again. I liked her," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Okay. That's all I wanted to know."</p>
<p>"Why? What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing? You're planning something and I want to know what it is."</p>
<p>"I'm not planning anything, Mikayla. Now, I have work to do. I'm leaving early today."</p>
<p>"Why are you leaving early? You never leave early."</p>
<p>"I have some… errands."</p>
<p>"I don't trust you. You have that look in your eye," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"I don't have a look in my eye. We'll talk tomorrow," she said.</p>
<p>Miley sped through town, trying to find Skyline. Of all days, she had appointments she couldn't get out of. She had left work late. She'd showered and changed, barely stopping long enough to feed Garfield. Now, it was five minutes after six and she was lost. She grabbed her cell phone and punched out Joannie's number.</p>
<p>"Get a map," she told her.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"A map."</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Where is Skyline?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Skyline! The street. Where is it?"</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"I'm trying to find Skyline, what the hell do you think I'm doing?"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Joannie! Please. I've got an appointment. I'm late. Where is it?"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay. It's on the north side. Past the Loop."</p>
<p>"Christ!"</p>
<p>"Where are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm on the damn Loop. MacArthur is coming up."</p>
<p>"You're too far. You need to go back."</p>
<p>"Shit! Fuck!"</p>
<p>"Why did you make an appointment this late? And don't most of your clients come to see you?"</p>
<p>"It's a special client," she said. "Hang on." She tossed the phone on the seat as she exited, speeding through the yellow light to cross over the Loop. She picked the phone up again. "Okay. Now, how far?"</p>
<p>"You have to go past Franklin. I think it's the Spencer exit," she said.</p>
<p>"You think?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Skyline's off of Spencer."</p>
<p>"Okay. I think I can find it. Thanks." She disconnected before Joannie could ask any more questions. It was already six-fifteen. Lilly would think she'd stood her up.</p>
<p>Lilly paced, then looked at the clock. She's not coming, she thought. After all this, she's not going to show.</p>
<p>"Go figure," she murmured. She walked past the flowers that lined the bar and grabbed the wine bottle. She opened it quickly, hating that she felt disappointed. Maybe Miley got held up?</p>
<p>"Maybe she changed her mind." Maybe, now that Lilly had agreed to see her, Miley lost interest. Oh, you're being ridiculous, she thought. It's only 6:20.</p>
<p>Miley pulled into the first parking spot she found and ran to the building, sliding to a halt in front of the reception desk.</p>
<p>"Elevators?" she gasped.</p>
<p>"Down the hall." She ran down the hall and pushed the 'up' button six times. She looked up and watched the floors.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ!" It was on the 14th and heading up, not down. She turned to the other wall and pushed that button several times. Sixteenth floor? She glanced at her watch. Nearly six thirty.</p>
<p>"Stairs."</p>
<p>She ran quickly to the end of the hall and pushed open the door to the stairs. She took them two at a time, running up the flights without thinking. By the time she burst into the hallway on the third floor, she was winded. The door closest to her was 346.</p>
<p>"Great."</p>
<p>She walked down the hall, then turned the corner. 323. Closer. She ran again. 319. 314. 310. She stood outside the door and took several deep breaths. Finally, she knocked.</p>
<p>Lilly jumped at the sound of the loud knocking. She glanced at her clock, then set her wineglass down. The knock came again.</p>
<p>She opened the door and stood staring at Miley. She finally raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Got lost," Miley managed between breaths.</p>
<p>"Why are you out of breath?"</p>
<p>"Stairs."</p>
<p>"We have elevators, you know."</p>
<p>"They were on fourteen and sixteen." Lilly nodded, then smiled, letting Miley enter. "You thought I stood you up, didn't you?" Miley asked.</p>
<p>"The thought crossed my mind," Lilly admitted.</p>
<p>"I would never miss an opportunity to see you," Miley said seriously. "Never."</p>
<p>Their eyes locked. Lilly's heart pounded, her chest heaving, matching Miley's, although she couldn't blame running up the stairs for her breathlessness. She walked the short distance to Miley, resting her hands against Miley's chest, feeling her heart as it pounded. They should have wine. They should talk.</p>
<p>"Please kiss me," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>Wine would have to wait. Lilly moved into her arms, sliding her hands around Miley's neck and pulling her closer until their lips met. Slow kisses, soft, gentle. Just lips meeting lips, moving across the others lightly. Miley slid her arms around Lilly's waist, pulling her closer and Lilly buried her face at Miley's neck and they held each other.</p>
<p>Miley closed her eyes, breathing in the scent of Lilly. It was perfect, the way Lilly fit in her arms.</p>
<p>Lilly finally pulled away, her eyes clouded with desire when she looked at Miley. She didn't want to have wine and she didn't want to talk.</p>
<p>"I want to make love to you," she whispered. She watched Miley's eyes turn nearly black. She reached out a hand and touched Miley's face lightly, moving her fingers across Miley's lips. "Please?"</p>
<p>Miley pulled her closer, her hands moving under her shirt to touch warm skin. This time, when their lips met, the gentleness was gone, replaced with a hunger neither could control. Tongues dueled and hands reacquainted themselves with each other. Miley groaned when she found Lilly's breasts. There was no bra to stop her.</p>
<p>"We should talk," Miley murmured as her lips found Lilly's again.</p>
<p>"Yes. We should."</p>
<p>"If only you'd worn a bra, maybe," Miley whispered as her hands massaged Lilly's breasts. Lilly bent her head back as Miley feasted on her neck. No, she didn't want to talk. She only wanted this woman's hands on her.</p>
<p>"Mmm, we'll talk later," Lilly moaned as her own hands moved over Miley's body. "Right now, I want my mouth on you."</p>
<p>Miley lay propped on her elbow, watching Lilly sleep. As she'd been doing for the last half-hour. She should really go. She was going to be hard-pressed to make it to work on time the way it was. But she couldn't make herself leave the warm bed.</p>
<p>Her hand reached out and touched Lilly's soft skin, moving in lazy circles just under her breast. She felt the familiar stirrings of desire whenever she touched this woman. She was exhausted, really, but her body still found the energy to respond. They had slept for a few hours here and there, always waking to make love all over again. Even now, as daylight broke over the city, her hand crept higher, molding itself to Lilly's breast. Green eyes opened slowly and found hers.</p>
<p>"Mmm," Lilly murmured, turning her head to find Miley's lips. Lilly's body stretched out, rolling slightly towards Miley. Her hand moved under the covers, sliding over Miley's hip before slipping between her legs. She found what she was looking for. Warm wetness enveloped her fingers. Her eyes locked on Miley's as she found her swollen, ready.</p>
<p>"I say we call in sick today," Lilly whispered. Miley lay back, pulling Lilly on top of her. Their bodies fit together perfectly and Miley wrapped strong arms around Lilly and held her. Then gentle lips found her own, kissing her lightly before Lilly buried her head at Miley's neck.</p>
<p>"I normally hate Valentine's Day," Lilly said. Her lips nipped gently at Miley's neck. "I especially hate Valentine's Day at the bar." Then she raised her head to meet Miley's eyes. "I'm thinking it's my new favorite holiday."</p>
<p>"Mmm. Years from now, we'll look back on this and laugh. That is, if Joannie and Mikayla are still speaking to us."</p>
<p>Lilly pulled back, staring into Miley's eyes. "Years from now?"</p>
<p>Miley held her stare with gentle eyes. "Yes. Years from now."</p>
<p>Lilly stared at her for the longest moment. Warm blue eyes held hers and they shown with nothing but honesty… and love.</p>
<p>"Do you believe in love at first sight?" Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>Miley smiled and her eyes brightened. "Absolutely."</p>
<p>The End</p>
