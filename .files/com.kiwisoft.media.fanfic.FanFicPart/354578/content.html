<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 9 -->

<p>Buffy walked into her mom's house dragging the reluctant slayer behind her
by the hand. "Hey B I think there's some vamps that need dusting so while
you talk to your mom I'll just go and…"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head at Faith and let out a small laugh, obviously ignoring
her attempts of getting out of the situation. "Mom, are you home?" Buffy
called out from the bottom of the stairs, almost hoping there would be no
response so she could have the night with Faith alone. Unfortunately for
both slayers, they heard Joyce walking around upstairs after Buffy called
out her name.</p>

<p>"Is everything okay Buffy? Why are you here so late?" Joyce asked as she
walked down the stairs. When she noticed the dark haired girl standing
behind her daughter she immediately stiffened, and her eyes narrowed.
"Faith," she said flatly as she stared the girl down.</p>

<p>"Mom, Faith's kinda awake now but she's good and we need a place to stay
tonight so can we stay here?" Buffy asked quickly even though she already
knew it would take more than that to convince her mom of Faith's being good.</p>

<p>"And I'm Betty Davis," Joyce said. Faith wanted to laugh at her attempt of
making a sarcastic remark, but she knew since she was here to defend
herself, laughing at the person you're trying to convince something of isn't
a good tactic. "What have you done to my daughter Faith?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do anything," Faith answered, becoming serious again. "I'm sorry
for everything I did before. I just want to make it up to all of you.
B…Buffy's given me another chance and so has the rest of the Scooby gang. I
just want another chance."</p>

<p>"Why should I believe what you say? You fooled us all before and put my
daughter's life in danger. I don't think it's quite that simple Faith,"
Joyce snapped. Buffy noticed Faith wince and knew how bad her mother's words
were hurting her girlfriend.</p>

<p>Buffy took hold of Faith's hand once more and stood half in front of the
brunette in a protective manner. "I won't say that you're wrong for being
angry with Faith. You have every right after all that happened. But you are
wrong if you won't give her another chance. Out of the people that she hurt
when she turned against us, who did she hurt the most?" Buffy asked her
mother. She felt Faith grip her hand tighter and she knew it was just as
painful for Faith to have to do this as it was for her.</p>

<p>"She hurt you the most Buffy. Why do you think I can't forgive her? I'm your
mother and it's my job to protect you," Joyce told her.</p>

<p>"You're right about one thing, that she hurt me the most. If I, of all
people, can forgive her and see the good that's in her, why can't you? I'm
an adult now mom, I don't need you to protect me anymore." Buffy stopped
talking and turned around to face her girlfriend. "Come on, let's go back to
the dorm since we obviously aren't welcome here," she said softly, hoping
that she could make the pained expression in her girlfriend's eyes disappear
somehow.</p>

<p>The two slayers began to make their exit, but just before they got out the
door they heard Joyce calling out to them. When they turned around they saw
the older woman looking at them regretfully. "I'm sorry, just give me some
time to come to terms with you being back Faith. If Buffy trusts you, then
I'll try to as well."</p>

<p>Both slayers flashed brilliant smiles at her and Joyce knew she made the
right decision. "Thank you Miss S. I'll prove to you that I'm good again,"
Faith told her as she walked out of the house. She turned around to see her
girlfriend giving her mother a hug and smiled at the two of them. It made
her wonder what ever made her decide being bad was better than being good in
the first place. Maybe it was easier, but it was far less rewarding. Not to
mention boring since you can't really make friends when you're trying to
kill them all.</p>

<p>"Whatcha thinking?" Buffy asked as she closed the door to her mom's house
and moved closer to Faith.</p>

<p>"Just that I like being on your side better than trying to fight you," she
said softly as she gave Buffy a quick kiss. "It's much more rewarding."
Faith took Buffy's hand into her own and the two walked down the street back
to Buffy's dorm where they hoped they'd be able to get rid of Missy somehow.
Unbeknownst to them, Joyce had been watching them from the window and saw
them kiss. She just shook her head, hoping that her daughter wouldn't get
hurt again. Joyce could only be thankful that at least Faith wasn't a
vampire.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Okay guys, I think it's time for me to head back. It was nice hanging with
you all tonight without all the tension like before," Missy said to the
group of friends as she stood from the table.</p>

<p>"Just remember that Xander's mine now," Anya told her with a smile as she
held onto Xander's arm.</p>

<p>"Like I'd want him," Missy said suddenly and her eyes went wide in surprise
of what she said. "Not that there's anything wrong with you Xander, I
just...Not my type?" Missy offered weakly and Xander just smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'm used to rejection," he told her. Missy laughed as she
waved goodbye and started to walk away from the group but she heard Willow
calling her name.</p>

<p>"You know it is pretty late and I have an early class tomorrow so I should
probably go too. We could give you a ride back in Oz's van. It's quicker and
not quite as vampire-y as it is if you were walking. And it's good because
vampires are bad and then they go grr and it's not fun so if you rode with
us it'd be fun because we're fun people."</p>

<p>Missy laughed, this being the first time she's seen Willow go into babble
mode and found it endearing. "Chill Willow, I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"Does this mean we can go have more orgasms now?" Anya asked Xander,
embarrassing him for the millionth time that night. Xander just nodded and
the two left the Bronze without saying anything else. Missy just shook her
head at them, amazed that she found someone with a bigger sex drive than
Jan.</p>

<p>Missy, Willow and Oz were right behind them and they made their way back to
the campus quickly. Oz dropped them off near Stevenson hall and Missy waited
for Willow so she could walk the red head back to her room. When they
reached Willow's room the duo saw the slayers walking up to them hand in
hand. "Glad to see you two worked things out," Missy said as she gave them a
proud look.</p>

<p>"Yeah, thanks for being brave enough to call me a dumbass," Faith winked at
her. "I'll get you back for that one day."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you try," Missy retorted, knowing full well that Faith
wouldn't do anything to her. Willow watched the exchange between the two
girls, amazed at not only how much they look alike but also how close their
personalities matched. She was still uncomfortable around Faith but she knew
that if Buffy loved her than she must be a better person and worth giving a
chance to.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes of Faith and Missy's banter Buffy tugged on Faith's
arm indicating it was time to move on to some more fun things back in the
room. "Are you two staying in the room tonight?" Missy asked and they both
nodded. "I feel bad. It's your first night together as being together and
I'll be there kinda ruining it."</p>

<p>"It's better than the alternatives," Buffy said even though she really
wished that Missy wouldn't be there as well. She liked having her roommate
around, but she thought it was about time her and Faith got some real time
alone.</p>

<p>"You can stay here tonight," Willow said to Missy hesitantly. She wasn't
very sure if she liked the idea or not, but it would help her best friend
out so she was willing to try. "My roommate's always at her boyfriends, and
it's better than being alone so if you wanted to stay you could. But if you
don't it's okay. I was just trying to be helpful because it's nice to be
helpful."</p>

<p>Missy grinned again at the red head's babble and nodded. "You know, I think
I might just take you up on that offer. I'll go grab some stuff from the
room and meet you back here." Missy walked back to the room and after Faith
and Buffy said their goodbyes to Willow they followed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Missy was in the room stuffing clothes into a bag when Faith and Buffy came
in. She just gave the two a smile and went back to gathering her things for
her night at Willows. By the time she finished, the two slayers were already
laying on Buffy's bed kissing and Missy found herself entranced by the
sight. Missy couldn't help but stare as she watched what was practically
herself making out with another girl. "You know, I would make one hot
lesbian," Missy thought out loud which caused the two slayers to break
apart.</p>

<p>Buffy was blushing and Faith just grinned at her. "You should try it
sometime." She turned to Buffy and her smile grew even larger. "Her and Red
would make a hot couple don't you think?"</p>

<p>Missy and Buffy's eyes grew larger as they stared at Faith. "Don't get any
ideas Faith, I like men just fine." When Buffy started making stuttering
sounds Missy stopped talking and both brunette's looked at the blonde,
trying to hold back their laughs.</p>

<p>"Chill B, I was just joking. Red's like the straightest girl I know." Faith
rubbed Buffy's back in a calming manner and the blonde relaxed.</p>

<p>"Okay, I'm outta here. You two can get back to whatever it is you were
doing." Missy gave them a smile but before she could leave Faith stopped
her.</p>

<p>"Be gentle with Red, she's the sensitive type." Faith winked at Missy and
Buffy's mouth just hung open again as she wondered what her girlfriend was
implying.  Missy shook her head and walked out, a knowing smile on her lips
and walked back down to Willow's room.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Missy left the two slayers cuddled on Buffy's bed and just held each
other in silence for a while. Buffy was resting her head on Faith's chest,
enjoying the feel of it rising and falling with every breath. She could feel
the brunette tracing patterns on her back with her fingers and she was sure
that she would melt into the brunette at any moment. "This is nice," Buffy
said softly.</p>

<p>"Mmm, it is," Faith murmured. "But you know what's better?" she asked as her
smile grew.</p>

<p>"There's something better than this?" Buffy questioned as she lifted her
head up so she could look at her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," Faith said as she slid two fingers under Buffy's chin and brought
the blonde's lips to her own. She slid her tongue over Buffy's bottom lip
before letting it sneak into her mouth to continue its exploration. Buffy
moaned softly and moved her body so she was half laying on the brunette and
half off as she deepened the kiss.</p>

<p>Faith wrapped her arms around Buffy's waist and pulled her closer, suddenly
craving more contact with her girlfriend. Buffy could feel Faith trying to
press her body up into her own as her hands slid under Buffy's shirt. Buffy
realized where this was going so she broke the kiss. "Wait Faith," she
whispered softly as she caught her breath.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry B. Did I do something wrong?" the brunette asked, afraid that she
had tried to move too fast.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at her reassuringly and gave Faith a quick kiss. "It's not that
baby. I want to...you know. It's just that I've never done this before. I
mean I have, just not with a girl and I don't really know what to do so I'm
kind of scared," Buffy confessed, hoping she didn't babble too much trying
to get that out.</p>

<p>Faith sighed in relief and rolled the blonde onto her back. "Then let me
show you B. Let me take care of you and make love to you, please?" Faith
asked. Her voice was filled with so much love and desire that Buffy could
only nod in response. Faith was amazed that Buffy actually wanted the same
thing and she once again claimed her lips with her own. When they broke
apart she brought the blonde into a sitting position and slowly lifted her
shirt off. "Just relax Buffy," Faith whispered just before kissing the
blonde again. Buffy was so shocked that Faith had used her whole name her
nervousness floated away and she did just as asked, glad to get lost in the
sensations of Faith's hands on her.</p>

<hr>

<p>"You have no idea how glad I am to be here," Missy said as she reclined on
Willow's bed. "The two were down each other's throats before I even got out
of the room. You have no idea how weird it is to see yourself with another
girl."</p>

<p>Willow laughed after Missy said that knowing by the look on the brunette's
face that she didn't really mind. "Actually I do know what it's like,"
Willow said as she sat down next to Missy on her bed. "When we were still in
high school Anya messed some things up and there was this vampire me from
another reality and she was kinda gay."</p>

<p>"Kinda gay? Is there such a thing?" Missy questioned as she rolled on her
side to face Willow. She had expected the night to be a million times more
awkward than it was since it was only recently that the two truly became
friends.</p>

<p>"Well there's bisexual people so isn't that kinda gay, or are they just
confused?"</p>

<p>Missy laughed, the red head had a point. "So then the vampire you was
bisexual?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I guess she was more than kinda gay. It was kind of freaky at
first but I guess it doesn't bother me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess so," Missy said. She briefly thought about bringing up what
Faith said about how they'd make a cute couple but she didn't think Willow
would find it funny. Of course, even if Willow didn't find it funny she was
sure she'd find Willow's reaction funny. "You know, before I left Faith said
you and I would make a cute couple."</p>

<p>Willow's mouth dropped and she turned a few shades redder as she stared at
Faith. "I... You and me? I have Oz. I love Oz," Willow nodded to help prove
her point and Missy held back a laugh. "Not that anything's wrong with
liking girls because it's okay I mean if you do or anyone else but Oz. I
have an Oz," Willow concluded finally and Missy let her laugh out.</p>

<p>"She was right, you are sensitive. I'm just as straight as you, at least
last time I checked. It's what she said, not me so just take a deep breath
okay?" Willow did as she was told and finally relaxed again. "You have an
early class tomorrow don't you?" Willow nodded and Missy stood up from the
bed with a small sigh. "Just give me a pillow and a blanket and I'll crash
here on the floor."</p>

<p>"You can't sleep on the floor. It's hard and cold and I have a bed," Willow
said and shook her head.</p>

<p>"You sayin' you wanna sleep with me Willow?" Missy asked with a smirk.
Willow started stuttering again and Missy laughed. "Okay, enough sarcastic
girl. I'm sorry Willow. I was just joking. Ha, ha, funny type stuff you
know?"</p>

<p>"I know it's just with Buffy and Faith and...God, I sound like an idiot
don't I?"</p>

<p>"No, it's cute actually. You're like a little kid who's afraid they'll send
their gayness to you like cooties or something."</p>

<p>Willow realized what Missy was saying is true and she felt like the biggest
dope in the world. Ever since her encounter with her vampire self she had
been afraid that there was some part of her that was gay but it was just
lying dormant. Now with Buffy and Faith being together, and just Faith being
back all together she'd been super spazzy lately. "I want you to sleep with
me, just in the non gay way." Willow paused and Missy smiled to herself.
'You just keep telling yourself that Willow,' she thought to herself, then
wondered what the hell made her think that in the first place. "You're like
my guest and it's not right to make you sleep on the floor. "</p>

<p>"Yeah sure," Missy said and she crawled into Willow's bed. Willow turned out
the lights and crawled in next to her new friend. The bed was fairly small
and as the two lay next to each other they realized there was no way to
sleep without their bodies touching each others. Willow quickly fell asleep,
and sleep wasn't far behind for Missy. 'Maybe Faith was right, me and Willow
would make a cute couple,' was Missy's last thought before joining her
friend in slumber.</p>
