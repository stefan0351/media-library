<p>A/N: Hehe, y'all gonna love me...</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>(Cell phone ringtone- I'm Just a Girl)</p>
<p>"Hello, my life sucks!" Paul immediately answered his phone, knowing who was gonna be on the other end.</p>
<p>"<i>Paul..</i>.." a pitiful voice whimpered in distress from the other side. Paul double-checked the caller id.</p>
<p>"Viola?"</p>
<p>"<i>Paul..!</i>" the voice came through a bit more urgent. Paul smiled cruelly for a second, being able to read the situation.</p>
<p>"You gotta say it."</p>
<p>"<i>What? No!"</i></p>
<p>"Then I guess my wisdom is not really needed to solve your troubles." Paul sighed, his evil smile still playing at the edges of his lips.</p>
<p>"<i>Oh, come on! I wanna have some girl-talk and you just want to take advantage of my innocent vulnerability!"</i> Viola protested.</p>
<p>"Say it or nothing." Paul demanded. There was a pause on Viola's side before he heard a sigh of defeat.</p>
<p>"<i>grumble."</i></p>
<p>"I can't hear you, what was that?"</p>
<p>"<i>I said 'Paul Almighty, will thou art assist a fair maiden in distress with thou hunkiness which evry' man hath desired?'</i>" Viola deadpanned in a robotic tone.</p>
<p>"Okay, what can this hunk of man do for you?" Paul said with a satisfied grin. Viola sniffed in discontentment.</p>
<p>"<i>Paul, its about Olivia, you remember her right?"</i></p>
<p>"The adorable blond that has a huge crush on you, how could I forget?"</p>
<p>"<i>YOU KNEW?"</i> Viola sounded floored. Paul chuckled.</p>
<p>"It was so obvious she might as well been wearing a medical bracelet that said 'Will die of happiness if Viola ever touched her'. If your head wasn't so full of soccer balls you would have noticed." Paul chastised his good friend. A stunned silence followed.</p>
<p>"<i>I... I honestly would have never known if she didn't confess to me today</i>."</p>
<p>"Oh, she confessed? I wish I was there to see your face."</p>
<p>"<i>This isn't funny, Paul! What am I gonna do?"</i></p>
<p>"What are you gonna do? What did you do when she confessed?" Paul asked, confused.</p>
<p>"<i>Nothing, she just left before I could say anything!"</i> Viola whined. Paul groaned.</p>
<p>"Vi, why are you so slow sometimes?"</p>
<p>"<i>My mom beats me with frilly dresses daily. Maybe that's why</i>." Viola accused.</p>
<p>"Blaming your own stupidity on your mother doesn't work most of the time." Paul said in amusement. "So what do you plan to do with your new-found knowledge?" he asked in curiosity.</p>
<p>"<i>I... I don't know. That's why I called you."</i></p>
<p>"Well, do you like her?"</p>
<p>"... <i>I don't know</i>."</p>
<p>"Do you know anything, woman?" Paul yelled in exasperation.</p>
<p>"<i>Guess not."</i> Viola retorted sullenly.</p>
<p>"I think its time you took a real long look at that girl. And I mean really look." Paul suggested. He waited a few seconds for the response.</p>
<p>"<i>I guess I never really thought of her... in that way... Sorta</i>."</p>
<p>"Hmm? That 'sorta' sounds interesting."</p>
<p>"<i>Well, there was the time I saw her naked in the shower. That was pretty interesting</i>." Viola said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"And..?" Paul urged.</p>
<p>"<i>And... At the carnival, it was like I </i>wanted<i> her to kiss me. How crazy is that?"</i></p>
<p>"Insane." Paul said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"<i>Also, when she asked Duke out on a date, I was... I was super jealous!</i>" Viola realized.</p>
<p>"Dang, how much drama did I miss out on?" Paul said to himself.</p>
<p>"<i>And, you know, I always thought she was pretty. Gorgeous, actually. I could just stare at her for hours and never get tired. And she has these eyes that kinda grabs your attention and never lets go and you feel like everything is right in the world when shes with you</i>..." Viola continued wistfully, deep in thought. Paul smirked.</p>
<p>"So you like her."</p>
<p>"<i>I never said that!"</i></p>
<p>"Vi! Just admit it to yourself! You're attracted to Olivia and shes attracted to you! Now what the hell is stopping you from hunting that girl down and making her yours this very minute?"</p>
<p>"... <i>Nothing."</i></p>
<p>'She will, she won't, she will, she won't...' Olivia chanted in her head at every step she took. She was currently on an evening jog to relieve some of her anxiety. Nothing could distract her from her current line of thought; what would Viola's answer be?</p>
<p>If the answer was no, then she was gonna have to toughen it up and try to still be Viola's friend. If the answer was yes... for some reason she couldn't bring herself to imagine the possibility of a 'yes'. Too much hope or something. If anything, she had to prepare to have her heart broken.</p>
<p>'She will, she won't, she will, she won't, she will...' At that moment she spotted a yellow cab pull up to the curb some feet below her and she was compelled to pause. The person to step out of the cab was the very subject of her thoughts.</p>
<p>"Viola." Olivia breathed out. Viola stood on the sidewalk as the cab pulled out and drove away, hands in her pockets and smiling shyly up at the blond standing on higher ground. She was wearing the attire she'd usually wear as a girl: jeans, sneakers and a t-shirt under a hoodie. Her hair was pulled up into a messy ponytail, but to Olivia she still looked amazing in anything.</p>
<p>The two girls simply stood facing each other for awhile just looking at each other, the atmosphere deepening with the silence. Finally, it was Viola who got the look in her eye to move and she made her way deliberately towards the other girl. Olivia suddenly had trouble getting air to her lungs and her heart was thumping so hard she couldn't hear anything else as Viola now stood in front of her looking down at her with brown eyes. And then she was enveloped in Viola's warmth as the taller girl wrapped her arms around her waist and pulled her closer. Olivia was too stunned to react even as Viola's head bent down the last couple of inches to capture Olivia's lips with a contented sigh.</p>
<p>'Is this for real..?' Olivia thought before her eyes fluttered close and she was swept up in the feeling of Viola's lips against her own and she surrendered to it, real or not. One of Viola's hands came up to cup the back of her head to tilt her head for better access and Olivia had to cling to her forearms to keep from fainting. Viola's mouth moved gently over her own as if testing the waters, but it still made Olivia melt into it, before she pulled her head away slightly. Olivia's mind was left in a blissfully buzzed state, eyes still closed as if savoring the moment when Viola placed her lips near her ear.</p>
<p>"I came to tell you I'm ready. I'm ready to fall into the unknown." Viola whispered into her ear, making a tremor go through Olivia's body and her breath hitched. Viola smiled at the reaction. Looked like her brother's lyrics were good for something after all. Olivia pulled back to peer into Viola's eyes searchingly for any hint otherwise, but Viola's eyes only reflected the earnest truth. And slowly but surely a smile filled with joy formed on the blonde's face. Viola smiled shyly back and her heart skipped a beat at how beautiful Olivia was, now that she was really looking at her.</p>
<p>Now Olivia threw her arms around Viola's neck and embraced her in another kiss, and this time the passion from Olivia was so intense that Viola's knees nearly buckled beneath the force of it. Olivia was in pure heaven as she tapped her tongue against Viola's lips and was immediately granted access. She moaned low in her throat when Viola pulled her up tight against her athletic body and she in turn tightened her hold on the taller girl, shamelessly pressing herself as close as possible to Viola's body, on display for the entire campus to see.</p>
<p>And someone was watching. From the bike garage a fair distance from the scene Duke was currently making the " ZOMG TWO GIRLS ARE TOTALLY MAKING OUT IN FRONT OF ME. " face. And then he realized the two girls were Olivia and Sebastian's sister and he turned his head away from the two girls having a passionate embrace, a dark blush on his cheeks. He decided that he shouldn't intrude and turned away to finish parking his Ducati, just missing another yellow cab pulling up.</p>
<p>The real Sebastian stepped out of the cab, slinging his guitar over his shoulder and grabbing his bags from the trunk. He had arrived early from his trip to London, which had gone really well for his band. So he felt things were going well for him in general. Especially when he spotted two girls making out not far from where he was on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"I think I'm going to like this school." he said to himself with a goofy grin on face. He couldn't see the girl's faces from his position, but it was still pretty hot that girls did that in public at this school. Total score for him, he thought. He turned around and started walking towards the dorms in search of his room, totally unaware of the circumstances his sister had left for him.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A/N- Tell me what you think, like it, hate it? I think it turned out okay but I'm not too sure.</p>
<p>In a week I'm gonna start working the night shift at my job. So my day time hours will be occupied with school and sleep. Just letting everyone know because I don't know if this change will effect my writing time if any. Better money though, so yay for that.</p>
