<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 16 -->

<p>Brooke gazed out the window, the events of the last half hour playing
through her mind over and over again torturously, like a broken record.  She
could still feel the warmth of Sam's body against her, trying to repel her,
hating her with every breath and every tear.  She could still feel Sam's
heartache through her slightly damp collar, breaking her heart again as she
fingered the wet material.  She raised her fingers to her lips and traced
them gently, they were still slightly bruised.  Moments after she had
stopped struggling Sam had raised her head, tears still streaming down her
face, and kissed Brooke with an almost savage intensity, as if she were
testing the blonde and punishing her at the same time.  As their lips
crashed together painfully Brooke had tightened the hold she had on Sam,
taking her punishment gracefully, even gratefully, softly stroking Sam's
cheek as she kissed her, for even in that package Brooke realized what the
kiss was, salvation.  Sam was going to forgive her, and finally she could
breathe again.</p>

<p>Now, Brooke stood in front of the window trying to find an answer, no,
trying to work up the courage to give the answers to Sam that she knew she
had to.  The questions Sam asked, teary eyed and pale, needed to be
answered, the issues addressed.  Brooke knew this, she just dreaded it.  She
had just gotten Sam back and now she had to tell her everything that could
push her away again.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Brooke said finally, running her hand through her hair again
as she remained looking out the window.  "I just got scared," she continued
turning around to face Sam plaintively.  "I've spent my entire life living
inside the box.  No, living inside the box inside the box.  You don't become
popular by being different, you find out what the model is and then you
shape yourself to it…and once you get there, you're comfortable, and all you
have to do is tow the line to stay in."</p>

<p>"And you worked hard to get there?" Sam asked although it was really more of
a statement.  "And Nicole threatened to take it away?" she asked in the same
tone, her eyes flittering away from Brooke's.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," was Brooke's reply.  Sam already  knew the answers
to the questions she asked so there was no need to address them directly.
"It's all that I knew in life and all that I'd ever needed to know.  I'm
popular Sam, it's what I do…it's what I am," she continued.  Sam looked away
from her and flopped down onto the bed.  "It's all I've ever been…for better
or for worse."</p>

<p>"So why are you here?" the brunette asked finally.  Her voice was a bit more
cutting than she had intended, but she couldn't really help the antagonistic
feelings that had been brought up by Brooke's little sermon.  Everything the
blonde had just said were reasons why Sam had denied what she had felt for
her in the first place.  When the plebeians mixed with the patricians
disaster always resulted.  Brooke was royalty that had consorted with the
peasant stock and was now threatened with being disinherited. This was a
proposition that Sam had never seen end well, inevitably social friction
always tore the lovers apart and Sam was dreading that that was what was
happening to them.  Rubbing at her eyes she wasn't sure who she was more
angry at, herself for falling for Brooke, or Brooke for being Brooke.</p>

<p>Brooke sighed heavily before responding.  "All popularity has gotten me is
an eating disorder, an inferiority complex, chronic indecisiveness-because
we can only be independent thinkers if everyone else is-a clan of psychotic
backstabbers for friends, and at times a kind of bipolar personality that
really is beginning to worry me," Brooke responded crossing over to where
Sam was sitting and kneeling down on the floor in front of her.  "That's
option A.  Option B, starts with an 'S', ends with an 'M' and has an 'A' in
the middle, which in the circle that is me spells unimaginable happiness,"
she continued resting her head in Sam's lap tentatively, then relaxing once
the overture wasn't rejected.  "Now, you'll have to excuse me because I am
blonde *and* a cheerleader…but eventually it became clear to me that there
really wasn't a choice at all."</p>

<p>Sam trailed her fingers through Brooke's hair as she spoke, before trailing
her hands along Brooke's jaw line and under her chin tilting her head up so
that Sam could look into her eyes.  From that position she bent her head
down and fleetingly pressed their lips together, her body flooding with
relief.  She could've told herself over and over again that Brooke was no
good for her and she was no good for Brooke, but she had tried that earlier
on and now knew for a fact that it just didn't do any good.  Even though
their relationship was riddled with problems the size of planetoids they
were in love, and that meant that nothing else really mattered, which
sometimes meant that they were going to fucked up the ass with a chainsaw
every now and then, but mostly meant that they were happy.</p>

<p>"So now what?" she asked looking down at Brooke once they separated.  Her
eyes were searching the blonde's, looking for clues as to where she really
was, what she was feeling under their fuzzy pink feelings for each other.
"We headline?"</p>

<p>"I would prefer not to," Brooke responded her eyes traveling the contours of
the ceiling.  Despite her declarations she was still trying to deal with the
entire situation.  She just didn't know if she was strong enough to endure
the whispers and the looks, she just couldn't fathom what it would be like
not to be admired.</p>

<p>"I know you don't want to go from pin-up to poster girl," Sam responded
knowingly,  "it just sounds like Nicole's taken that option away," she
observed more soberly.  "I only see three options: we can be outted…as it
were, we can be out," she said placing emphasis on that one, "or we can be
over," she finished softly.</p>

<p>Brooke looked over that Sam intensely after she finished speaking, watching
her for a moment.  "That's not an option," she said softly in response to
Sam's last statement.  "And the other two don't necessarily need to be
either," she continued thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Sam watched Brooke carefully, there were so many emotions floating across
her features that the brunette couldn't keep track of them.  She would have
asked what Brooke was thinking, but she wasn't really confident that the
blonde had any more of an idea what was going through her head than Sam did.
  "What do you mean?" she asked deciding to concentrate on the small picture
of the moment.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to her, maybe convince her not to do this," Brooke said
softly.  "I know you all think she's some evil demon spawn, but there's more
to her than nice hair and biting one liners, I've seen it.  If I can get at
that part of her, the part that's been my friend then…" Brooke trailed off
knowing the rest of the sentence would come to Sam intuitively.</p>

<p>"And if not?" Sam asked gently.  She could tell that it was a painful
subject for Brooke, that the cheerleader wanted to believe that her friend
wouldn't sell her out, but she also heard a kind of dubious tone in Brooke's
voice, as if she wasn't completely confident that she could convince Nicole
herself.</p>

<p>"If not, then it comes down to this:  It's all about being popular, Nicole
thinks that if this gets out I'll be dethroned and she can take over as
Princess of Candyland, and she's probably right," Brooke started
thoughtfully, pushing her more sentimental feeling to the side.  "But as
much as Nicole knows my secret I know hers," she continued a somewhat
haunted look taking over her features.  "So, it becomes a matter of whose
secret is more scandalous, and whether or not she's willing to let hers out
to out us," she concluded.</p>

<p>"I see you didn't go all of those years without picking something up from
her," Sam responded softly as she ran her fingers through Brooke's hair
soothingly.  "What did she do?  Steal money from a homeless shelter?"
Whatever it was would have to be huge, since gayness was a pretty big deal.</p>

<p>Brooke beckoned Sam to lean down, then whispered something in her ear.</p>

<p>"Ohmygod!" Sam exclaimed, her lips curving into a smile, then her brows
scrunching together before being followed by a look of revulsion but also
fascination.  "Are you serious?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Brooke responded, slightly amused by the expressions on Sam's
face.  She must have looked the exact same way when she found out.  It was
an oddly fascinating tale, even though you kind of felt bad for being
intrigued by it.</p>

<p>"That'll do it," Sam replied sobering up a bit.  "That'll definitely do it."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke agreed resting her head against Sam's thigh wearily.  "I just
hope it doesn't have to come down to that."</p>

<p>"She means a lot to you, doesn't she?" Sam asked running her hand under
Brooke's chin and tilting her head up so that they were looking at each
other.  Brooke merely lowered her eyes, confirming Sam's question silently.
  "Sometimes," Sam said a moment later, "we don't always get what we
want…but if we try, sometimes we just might find we'll get what we need."</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a minute than smiled.  "And sometimes, we can't get no
sa-tis-faction," she replied breaking out into a full fledged grin.  Nothing
cheered her up more than words of wisdom for the Rolling Stones, actually
ice-cream did, but this was good too.</p>

<p>Sam looked down at her for a moment after than, a soft smile playing across
her features as she watched Brooke seem marginally happy for the first time
in days.  When the blonde finished laughing, she meet Sam's eyes and the
watched each other for a while in a comfortable silence.  Sam's eyes were
drawn to Brooke's lips after a moment, they were slightly red and puffy, and
she reached out and traced them lightly with thumb.  She had done that to
her she remember sadly.  Sam let in finger fall after a moment and leaned
down bringing their lips together softly, lovingly as if trying to erase the
damage she had done earlier.</p>
