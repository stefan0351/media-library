<p>This is my first fanfic, and I'm writing it because I have major writers block for another story I'm writing. It's rated M to be safe, just incase things get a little more intense later in the story. Hope you like it! Review please! But be gentle...</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I do not own She's the Man, or Harry Potter, or a company, or the empire state building, or a pony... *sigh*</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"Hey Liv, wait up!" called a familiar voice from behind me. I turned to acknowledge the voice's request, at the same time attempting to replace the stupid grin, which had just appeared on my face, with a slightly more appropriate friendly smile. An attempt witch completely failed when I actually laid eyes on the unbelievably gorgeous girl who was now approaching me.</p>
<p>Viola Hastings fell into step beside me. She was no longer clad in her girl-pretending-to-be-a-boy garb, but was instead fitted out in her new uniform. Her <b>girls</b> uniform. Her long wavy brown hair was no longer shoved under a wig, but instead was flowing down her back like the calmest waterfall. Her uniform consisted of a high khaki skirt, light blue blouse, with the top three buttons undone, and dark blue sweater, which had the school emblem emblazoned on it. She had somehow managed to make the skirt look much shorter than it actually was, which I didn't exactly understand because Viola was not that kind of girl. But then again maybe it was my imagination, but why would I be imagining that? I hurriedly pushed these thoughts out of my head as Viola continued to speak.</p>
<p>"Mind if I walk with you to biology?" She asked.</p>
<p>Biology was the only class we had together, and so had quickly become my favorite subject.</p>
<p>"Of course not! Why on Earth wouldn't I?" Was my rushed reply.</p>
<p>Viola shrugged lamely.</p>
<p>"I don't know, maybe you finely decided that you can't be friends with the creepy cross dressing girl, who is so obsessed with soccer that she was willing to pretend to be her twin brother, and come up with this huge, elaborate plan to go to a completely different school in order to win a soccer game and prove a stupid point about girls being just as good as boys. I'd say that would be a good reason."</p>
<p>I laughed and Viola's smile widened.</p>
<p>"Vi, we've talked about this a thousand times! I understand that you did what you did because you love soccer and honestly I think that your dedication is quite inspiring." I said lightly.</p>
<p>This was true. We had gone over this more times than I could count. It seemed to me quite the empowering act, to do something so daring for something you are passionate about. And It only added yet another virtue to the long growing list of amazing qualities Viola Hastings seemed to possess.</p>
<p>"Geez Liv, it's so awesome how cool you are about this whole thing." Said Viola, breaking into my thoughts. "I honestly don't know what I'd do with out you." She placed a hand on my arm and looked directly into my eyes.</p>
<p>The skin under her hand felt like it was on fire and the contact was sending electric waves through my body, my mind was drawing a total blank due to the intensity in her emerald green eyes. It was like she was Sebastian all over again, able to turn me into a melted puddle with nothing more than a touch, a look, and a few heart felt words. But this wasn't Sebastian, or anyone else pretending to be him. This was Viola, his twin sister, a girl! And somehow, nothing had changed.</p>
<p>I mumbled something like, "Yeah, sure, no problem, anytime..." as we rounded the corner and entered the last hallway on our way to Bio. I silently rejoiced that I would not be parting with my companion once we reached the door. I didn't want this floating-on-air sensation to end.</p>
<p>She let me go in first, causing me to giggle as she made this huge sweeping motion with her arm and said jauntily "Ladies first madam!"</p>
<p>I breezed by her with a high and mighty air and said a short, "Why thank you good sir."</p>
<p>We were both giggling uncontrollably by the time the bell rang and we took our seats.</p>
<p>It was impossible for me to stay focused in class that day, partially because we were just reviewing what we had gone over the day before and partly because Viola kept leaning over, giving me a clear view straight down her shirt.</p>
<p><i>Wait</i>. I thought suddenly, <i>Why am I looking down her shirt! Stop it Liv! Stop it! You're not a...a... a what? </i></p>
<p>A perv? A lesbian? Well, I definitely was not a lesbian. Not that I have a problem with lesbians, live and let live right? But I liked boys. Well, I didn't currently like any boys, but I had. When I had first found out that Sebastian was actually Viola, and that the real Sebastian did actually look quite a bit like her and seemed to be just as sweet, we had dated a bit. But after a while it became clear that the real Sebastian was nothing like the Sebastian which Viola had created. And the relationships hit a dead end. We had both been okay with it, Sebastian had his music to worry about and I... Well, I had his sister to chase after. So maybe I was bi then? The idea had never crossed my mind, I mean, I'd had girl crushes before, but those were all on celebrities or famous athletes. That was different. Right? But that still didn't explain these emotions I was experiencing towards Viola, emotions that I had felt before, but never to this extremity. Never before had I been looking at someone and just wanted to rip their cloths of and...</p>
<p>"Liv, Liv...OLIVIA!"</p>
<p>I jumped and looked up into Viola's eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>"The bell already rang hon," she said gently, grinning as she took in the delirious look on my face, "It's time to go to lunch."</p>
<p>I nodded vaguely, my mind stuck on the fact that she had just called me "hon".</p>
<p>We walked to the cafeteria together, all the while Viola was chatting away about soccer practice and the team and what big games they had coming up. I was completely content to simply listen to her ramblings and enjoy being with her, she just made things so easy.</p>
<p>We got our lunches and looked for a place to sit. Finding a table with Duke, Toby, Eunice, who was where ever Toby was, Andrew, Maria and some of our other friends, we sat down to enjoy the free time. I glanced over at Viola to see if she was going to be okay. She and Duke had broken up just a little while ago and I knew that both of them were still hurting a bit. But Viola was just so strong, if she felt uncomfortable, it didn't show.</p>
<p>"So," Duke began, "any of you guys going to Chandler's party tonight?"</p>
<p>Most of the people at the table shrugged. So did I.</p>
<p>"I don't know," I said noncommittally, "Are you going Vi?"</p>
<p>If she was going, giant spiders couldn't keep me away from that party.</p>
<p>"Well, yeah. Actually I was thinking of going. You know, it's friday night, it would be good get out and have some fun. Besides, I haven't been to a good party since I left Cornwall, Illyria's definitely lacking on my party meter." She said with a cheeky grin.</p>
<p>Even though Viola was no longer the well worshiped womanizing god of a man that she had been as Sebastian, she was still a trend setter, and looked up to by most of the students at this school. I knew as well as anyone that if Viola Hastings was going to be at the party, so would most of the student body.</p>
<p>"Well thats settled then!" Said Duke with a grin, "who wants a ride?"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Welllll? What did you think? Viola and Duke's break up will be addressed again later. At the party, sparks will fly! I'll try to update again soon. Thanks!</p>
