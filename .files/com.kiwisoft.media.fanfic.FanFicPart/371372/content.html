<p><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
<p><i>21st</i><i> December</i></p>
<p>The changing rooms were bustling with all different forms of life as Lilly sat on a bench and attempted to buckle her ski boots. Her mother was somewhere nearby, probably searching for her third pair of gloves, but Lilly had lost her some time before in the crowded room.</p>
<p>It smelled of hot feet and fresh, mountain air, an interesting combination to Lilly's nose, as the door to the slopes kept swinging open and shut, and people around her heaved on their boots. Small children clasping miniature skis were standing, sucking thumbs, and looking doe-eyed as parents fussed and straightened hats on their heads. Gloves were being dropped on the floor and picked up again every few seconds and men were calling for their wives while endless children ran off excitedly, drawn as if by some instinctively playful magnet towards the snow.</p>
<p>"Oh here you are Lilly." Heather Truscott's voice broke through to her daughter and she suddenly appeared among the throng of people.</p>
<p>"I'm right where you left me." Lilly stated the obvious before returning to her boots, which were giving her serious issues.</p>
<p>Heather Truscott fretted with her gloves for a little longer before noticing that her daughter needed help. She bent down, lightly smacked Lilly's tiring fingers away from the stiff buckles and set about fixing her feet into the ski boots with practiced ease. "All done." Heather stated at last and helped her daughter get to her feet, "How do they feel? Not too loose?"</p>
<p>"No they're great mum, thanks." Lilly replied and picked up her skis.</p>
<p>"Good." Heather nodded her approval, "We don't want them flopping off your feet when you fall over in the snow."</p>
<p>"And who says I'm going to fall?" Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>Heather smiled, "Your brother and Sarah may have a bet on it, but that's not for me to tell you about. Anyway, come along dear, you don't want to keep your group waiting."</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>A cluster of anxious middle-aged women, a man in his forties, some nine year olds and Lilly stood in a quiet circle as a French man in a bright yellow jacket helped a little boy learn to click on his skis properly.</p>
<p>"Everyone," their instructor addressed the group, "you must ensure zat ze skis are clicked on before you go. Eef you do not, zen you will be in trouble. Shake ze snow off your boots and zen put on ze skis, otherwise ze snow will affect ze skis and they will come off. Is zat clear?" There was a mumble of understanding and the instructor nodded, "Excellent. My name is Jean-Michelle, and I am going to look out for you on ze slopes and teach you how to ski." He smiled warmly at the nervous and excited faces, "Now we 'ave just a couple more people to arrive and zen we will go."</p>
<p>Lilly looked about at the scene, at the medley of people that were beginning to strike the snow beneath them and head in the direction of the ski lifts and slopes. Little children with sleds were tobogganing down a small slope nearby and others were playing in a winter playground. Snowmen were steadily being erected and small snowball fights broke out every few feet.</p>
<p>The cold air nipped Lilly's face, and all other exposed patches of skin, and she was glad to be wrapped up in her ski jacket.</p>
<p>"Sorry I'm late." A friendly voice twanged through the air next to Lilly as a familiar girl trudged up beside her through the snow.</p>
<p>"Zat is quite alright… Miss?"</p>
<p>"Miley, my name's Miley Stewart." Miley informed their instructor.</p>
<p>"Hello Miley." Jean-Michelle replied before assisting her with her skis and giving her the same information that he had told the group before.</p>
<p>Once Miley was haphazardly balanced on the long planks beside Lilly she offered the blonde a warm grin, "Mornin' Lilly, seems like we're in the same ski group, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." Lilly smiled back, "Are you nervous?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded, "I'm not gonna lie and say I'm not, how about you?"</p>
<p>"A bit, but I'm excited as well."</p>
<p>"Good, me too." Miley replied and met Lilly's eyes before the blonde had to look away and face the instructor who was addressing the group once more.</p>
<p>"Right zen everybody, we are going to head off. To get moving, just push along ze ground with ze poles. We will come to a leettle slope, so I want you to go down, keeping ze skis parallel and wait until you come to a stop, or brake. To brake, we push ze skis togezzer at ze front, like zis…" Jean-Michelle showed them with his own skis and several members of the group mimicked, "…Good, good. Now, off we go!"</p>
<p>The instructor led the way and Lilly began to push against the ground with her own poles, feeling the pressure in her shoulders as she shifted her weight forward. Miley was beside her, a fixed look of absolute concentration set on her face, along with trepidation, that Lilly couldn't help giggling at.</p>
<p>Miley looked up abruptly, "What are you laughing at blondie?"</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, "Nothing really, just your expression when you're trying to push yourself along."</p>
<p>Miley laughed, "Sorry, I do get a weird face when I'm focusing on stuff. But it's not like you look completely normal all hunched over like that. Stand up a bit straighter girl; you're not going to fall over on the flat."</p>
<p>"Thanks for the pointer Miss Expert." Lilly retorted as she corrected her posture, "Okay, this isn't so bad."</p>
<p>They were beginning to approach the baby slope now, which the children were still sliding down. More adept skiers were over-taking the group of beginners, including Lilly's own brother who swerved dangerously close to her, "Hey, watch it!" Lilly called out, but Matt only laughed.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the baby runs today Lilster!" He hollered back before disappearing down the small mound only to reappear at the bottom of it, gliding along with effortless skill.</p>
<p>"That your brother?" Miley asked as she pushed along to keep level with Lilly.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately he is." Lilly replied.</p>
<p>"Mine's the same." Miley sympathised, "He made my dad take us skiing because he's been loads of times with his friends and wanted us to do it. It's not really my thing but it is Christmas and I didn't want to spend it away from them."</p>
<p>"Same with my family really," Lilly said, "but I was quite happy with the whole idea. My brother got engaged to his girlfriend back in October and my parents thought that this would be a great thing to do so that our family can bond…"</p>
<p>"And now," Jean-Michelle's voice boomed over them once more, "we go down ze first leettle slope…" before he disappeared over the small hill, came to the bottom and spun round with apparent ease to stop and wait for his group of skiing misfits.</p>
<p>"Well, here we go then." Lillt said and set her poles into the snow, gave herself a hard push and whooshed down the slope. The wind blew back the loose bangs which evaded her hat and had framed her face, whilst the slope beneath her was smooth, and the whole sensation was rather exhilarating. She managed to come to a stop as Jean-Michelle had earlier shown them and twisted around to watch Miley, who also survived the incline, but whose legs shook as she braked.</p>
<p>"Stopping is definitely not the easiest part." Miley confessed as she saw Lilly watching her, "My legs get all wobbly because they're not strong enough. But, I'm sure you're used to it with all that surfing and skating you do?"</p>
<p>Lilly was mildly taken aback that Miley knew her hobbies so well, when they had never really spoken before, "Well yes I guess you can say my legs have a bit of muscle in them."</p>
<p>"You'll be grateful for that later, I can tell ya." Miley reflected before the girls rejoined the group and set off towards the baby ski runs.</p>
<p>Long hills which curved off to their right were soon before them and Lilly gulped. The slopes weren't particularly steep; it was just the first bit that looked scary for it jutted down menacingly to the amateur's eye. A ski lift slowly chugged above them, bringing excited and chattering couples to the top of the slope, including a young man who shouted over to Miley, "Hey sis, just been warming up on the baby runs but now dad and I are heading further up the mountains, we'll catch you at lunch okay?"</p>
<p>"Thanks Jackson." Miley called, and smiled at her father who waved at her when disembarking from their swinging bench.</p>
<p>"Catch ya later bud." Mr Stewart said to Miley before pushing into the snow to catch up with his son.</p>
<p>"Brothers." Miley muttered to Lilly who smiled.</p>
<p>"Now zen, we are going to do zis slope." Jean-Michelle began, "Eet looks a leettle bit scary, but really it is okay. You just need to get down ze first bit and zen it is easier. To turn ze skis, do zis." Jean-Michelle began to make another example of the footwork that was to be required when the group tackled the slope. He then went on to suggest the easiest way down the hardest looking part of the slope, informing them to stay as horizontal to the incline as possible, with parallel skis, and to turn quickly so that they would not lose control.</p>
<p>Lilly faced the slope, trepidation rising up through her body to match the adrenaline that was already pumping, she turned to Miley again, "Are you ready to do this?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded and looked at Lilly, who could easily make out the nerves fluttering within her cerulean eyes, "Let's go."</p>
<p>To Lilly's surprise Miley was the first member of the group to push off and handle the slope, she did well and was elegant in her movement, gliding diagonally down the hill before turning, a little shakily, and tackling the next part. Lilly followed in her tracks, taking it easy and putting her faith in the strength of her legs, which were serving her well so far, despite the corners being difficult. Eventually she made it down to where Miley had come to a stop, on the next flat and met the brunette with a smile, "Well, that was fun." Lilly confessed and Miley's face lit up with hers.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it wasn't too bad actually. Sure does look a lot worse from up there than it actually is. You're pretty good on those skis Truscott." Miley looked at her appraisingly with eyes that sparkled.</p>
<p>Lilly felt her stomach jolt, "Erm thanks, but I was only following in the footsteps of the master. For someone that's only been skiing once you do know what you're doing."</p>
<p>Miley shook her head, "I really don't actually, and I just know the basics. It's quite straightforward to learn how to brake and turn, like riding a bike, you never forget. You'll soon be overtaking me because I'm not really cut out for skiing."</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged, "We'll see, but I think you're wrong."</p>
<p>Miley shook her head and opened her mouth to continue arguing but their instructor had returned, was reassembling the group into a line and telling them more about how to take on the slopes.</p>
<p>Slowly, and following the good directions of Jean-Michelle, the unsteady group of new skiers made their descent down the baby slopes. Lilly was beginning to revel in her new-found ability and progress when suddenly the only grown-up male in the group lost control and began coming up behind her a little too fast.</p>
<p>"Watch out!"</p>
<p>Lilly heard him and started turning, but she wasn't yet quick enough to instigate a fast manoeuvre and found herself struck from behind by a heavy weight that knocked some of the wind out of her. She hit the snow on her side and twisted, ending up with her face buried in the soft flakes.</p>
<p>"Lilly!" Miley's voice was calling out as she skied over to her and Lilly rolled over onto her back.</p>
<p>"I'm fine." Lilly stated and smiled at Miley's concern, which soon dissolved the other girl's panic into a smile of her own.</p>
<p>"I can see that. Here, let me help you." Miley stretched out her hand to the other girl, and Lilly gladly took it. Miley hauled her upwards with ease, until Lilly was halfway to standing and slid forward on her skis, taking Miley's feet out from beneath her and both girls hit the snow.</p>
<p>Laughter filled the air as the pair realised that it may not have been the best idea and their good humoured instructor had to come to both of their aid, "Girls," Jean-Michelle addressed them, "if you want to help each other up, zen zis is what you must do." He then continued to demonstrate to the entire group how to help another who had fallen and explained that it was very difficult indeed for a beginner to get up completely unaided.</p>
<p>The rest of the journey down the slope went by without any disasters from the pair of young ladies, although a few other members of their group happened to bite the dust, and the man who had taken Lilly out went down more than once more. Finally they reached the bottom and joined the queue of skiers in a line for the ski lift.</p>
<p>"Now, I will tell you how to get on ze lift." Jean-Michelle said to his group, "You must position yourself in ze grooves which 'ave already been made in ze snow and zen let ze lift catch you from behind and take you upward, before resting your skis on ze bar. Is this all clear?" The group nodded nervously and paired off for the lift. Miley and Lilly naturally stuck together and smiled at one another as they stood in line.</p>
<p>To reach the lift, the skiers had to make their way up a small slope in their skis before they could take up position in front of the benches which would swing around to scoop them up. Lilly approached the slight incline with caution, since skis were designed for downhill, and not up. However, Jean-Michelle had taught them how to climb slopes only a little while before so she turned herself sideways and dug her skis into the snow to manage her short climb. Slowly Lilly ascended and reached the space in the queue, behind two other pairs, for the next couple, before turning to smile at Miley who was beginning her climb.</p>
<p>Just as Miley was nearing the small summit to take her place next to Lilly, she lost concentration for a moment, her skis twisted and she went flying backwards into the netted fence that roped off the area of the lift. She almost went tumbling over the barrier itself and had to be helped by a few of the older women in their group. Lilly found herself mercilessly laughing with glee after Miley's previously smug attitude at being the only person to have not fallen down the slope.</p>
<p>"Ha. Ha. Very funny." Miley reproached Lilly sarcastically with a face that was red from embarrassment.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Miley, it's just that was so <i>funny</i>." Lilly continued giggling and the corners of Miley's mouth twitched as she attempted to suppress a smile. "But," Lilly regained some of her decent composure, "are you okay?"</p>
<p>Miley smiled at Lilly, "Yeah I'm fine thanks. That was unexpected though. It takes a surprising amount of effort to go uphill and my knees were knockin' like crazy after all that braking down the slope."</p>
<p>"Well, hopefully this holiday will help get you into shape." Lilly teased.</p>
<p>"I thought I already was." Miley pouted.</p>
<p>"Round is a shape…" Lilly muttered.</p>
<p>"What's that you're saying?" Miley turned to Lilly in fake mortification and Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I'm just messing with you. I really shouldn't because I don't even know you that well." Lilly replied.</p>
<p>Miley smiled, "It's okay. Luckily for you I like being mocked and having all my self-assurance drained out of me by others." She then winked at Lilly, before looking at her steadily, "I am glad to have you here though." Miley confessed.</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed and the same jolt which she had experienced earlier occurred once more in her stomach, but before she could say anything further or assess the situation their instructor was ushering them forward to get on the lift.</p>
<p>It was simple really, they just had to align themselves in the grooves, side by side and then the lift struck the backs of their legs so that they sat down. Miley reached above them and pulled down the safety bar as they sat with ski poles in one hand and watched the slope drop beneath them as they climbed slowly upward.</p>
<p>A strange silence settled between the girls as they were gently rocked and watched the people on the slopes under them. Lilly was suddenly filled with a need to know more about this elusive Miley Stewart, but could hardly even begin to think of where to start in her questions. Plus she was puzzled by her feelings which she had around this other girl, who she barely knew and yet was so comfortable with. Lilly could only really describe them as a desire to become this girl's friend, and for her to like and accept Lilly because that would make everything in Lilly's life better. To be friends with Miley was quickly becoming Lilly's aim for this holiday, since the other girl seemed so, well, special to her, for reasons that Lilly couldn't determine. She was funny and pretty and kind and smart, and both girls seemed to be on the same level. <i>That was it,</i> Lilly reasoned to herself internally, <i>we're meant to be friends, I know it</i>.</p>
<p>"Do you think it's weird to be on holiday rather than at home over Christmas?" Miley's question suddenly interrupted Lilly's train of thoughts.</p>
<p>"Erm, I guess it is kind of weird." Lilly answered, "But in my opinion, home is where the heart is."</p>
<p>Miley grinned, "That's kinda cheesey Lilly… and it's the right answer I guess. My dad and brother are my two favourite people and it's good to be here with them, even if <i>here</i> isn't my first choice with the whole skiing thing."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, "Yeah but at least this way you're getting a white Christmas."</p>
<p>"True, and with views like this, well it could just be the most beautiful place on earth to spend a Christmas."</p>
<p>"It's like a Hallmark card or something." Lilly muttered.</p>
<p>The ski-lift continued to climb the mountain as the two girls took in the view, until they reached the top of the ascent.</p>
<p>"Now, how do we get off this thing again?" Lilly asked with a smile to Miley who was analysing the situation of the approaching exit.</p>
<p>"Just do as Jean-Michelle says I guess." Miley chewed her lip for a moment, "Put the safety bar up, stand when the ground is beneath you and just glide off naturally."</p>
<p>"Got it." Lilly replied confidently, and when the time came both girls survived the dismount.</p>
<p>The rest of the ski lesson consisted of tackling the baby slopes a few more times and perfecting the most basic of ski skills which they had learned that day. By noon both girls were feeling exhausted, with trembling legs and hungry bellies. Fortunately the ski lesson ended there, after a hard three hour slog and they were allowed to return to their families, who were awaiting them in the square outside the hotel.</p>
<p>"Hello darling," Heather greeted Lilly as she slid over the flat towards her mother, "how'd it go then?"</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, "Hey mum. Yeah it went good thanks." She shared a smile with Miley, "Mum this is Miley by the way. We're in the same ski class."</p>
<p>Heather beamed and extended her hand at once towards the other girl, "Miley, it's a pleasure to meet you. Lilly's told me so much about you."</p>
<p>Miley laughed and shook Heather's hand, "I wasn't aware there was much to tell." She stated good-heartedly and Lilly giggled.</p>
<p>"There's plenty to tell today Miley, after your little accident near the ski lift."</p>
<p>Miley blushed but was quick to come back, "Well you fell over too, so I guess there'll be some money exchanged between your brother and his fiancé."</p>
<p>Lilly grinned in good humour, "Yeah, yeah. I'm going to get out on those slopes this afternoon and practice, then you'll be in for it tomorrow."</p>
<p>Miley laughed, "Whatever you say Truscott."</p>
<p>Heather smiled as she watched the two girls' repertoire of gentle teasing, "And will you be skiing this afternoon Miley?" She asked.</p>
<p>Miley shook her head, "Not today I'm afraid. My dad and brother have already booked for us to go to take in the views at the top of one of those mountains." Miley pointed off in the direction of the higher summits, "Dad wants to take some pictures and he can't really have his good camera on him when he goes skiing. But…" Miley looked at Lilly, "I will be in the bar later this evening, if you would like to join us?"</p>
<p>Lilly felt a warm smile wrap itself across her features before she had a chance to stop it, "I would love to actually."</p>
<p>"Cool. Catch ya later then Lilly." Miley winked at her again, before turning to Heather, "It was nice to meet you Mrs Truscott."</p>
<p>"Please, call me Heather." Lilly's mother insisted.</p>
<p>Miley grinned and waved at Lilly as she wandered off in the direction of her father and brother who had already shed their ski equipment in favour of her father's camera, which was already pressed to his eye as he snapped his daughter approaching them.</p>
<p>"Come on dad, that's enough…" Miley protested as she grew nearer and Lilly chuckled as she watched the other girl walk away. She was looking forward to their evening drinks already.</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>Lilly ascended the final steps which led into the bar area of the hotel and couldn't help feeling more than a little awed by the place. As she pushed back one of the double doors she was greeted by the sight of warm fire places and comfortable squashy couches with low tables. There was a good general atmosphere about the place as the room was filled with people relaxing after a hard day's skiing. The dress-code was casual as people lounged in tracksuits and t-shirts with light jumpers, happy for the break from the cold to be spent in good company with a drink by their sides.</p>
<p>The blonde's appreciation of the area was soon overcome by the nerves she was feeling at meeting Miley that evening. Lilly was rarely ever shy, and the thought that she should be feeling this way was something that she couldn't really understand. It was only Miley after all, and she saw the other girl at school practically everyday, in passing of course. Yet something about this setting in the Alps, after getting to know her better, was beginning to change everything.</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes swivelled about the room as she approached the bar itself, which was another attractive piece to the area. It was a square which backed onto a wall and coloured in a dark brown wood, to fit in with the general rich colours of the room. Three smiling bar staff were working in simple white shirts and black trousers. The attention of their punters was focused on their drinks, each other, or the television screens in a further area which was set aside for viewing purposes.</p>
<p>That was when Lilly noticed Miley, who was looking towards the blonde. Feeling Miley's eyes on her already from the other side of the bar made blood pool to Lilly's cheeks, although she could not say why. In her head the blonde quickly went over her outfit, the way her hair was styled and glanced down to clock the shoes she was wearing, but nothing seemed out of place. This put her in ease more for when she approached the brunette, who was casually seated on a stool and sipping from a glass which contained a small amount of creamy liquid.</p>
<p>"Hey Lilly." Miley greeted softly and her eyes, glowing in the warm yellow lights of the bar area, caught Lilly's up at once and brought another unstoppable smile to the blonde's face.</p>
<p>"Hello Miley," Lilly grinned, "how was your afternoon?"</p>
<p>Miley lowered her glass thoughtfully, "It was pretty great actually. We went to the top of one of the slopes in a cable car and had lunch in this nice restaurant. Then dad went and took his artistic shots with some holiday snaps of us thrown in," Miley rolled her eyes smilingly, "but it was a good afternoon. It's really beautiful up there, you should go some time."</p>
<p>"Alright, I will then." Lilly answered and Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"Well I'm glad I managed to sell that to you." Her eyes were twinkling, "Can I get you a drink?"</p>
<p>"Erm sure." Lilly was uncertain and glanced to Miley's own glass, "What are you drinking by the way? It looks interesting."</p>
<p>Miley chuckled, "Baileys, it's some Irish cream liqueur. Have you heard of it?" Lilly shook her head, "Well it's really nice, here try some."</p>
<p>Miley held the glass up towards Lilly's mouth and the blonde froze for a moment as she noticed the brunette wanted her to take a share in her drink, in the glass that her lips had touched, where her mouth had taken up some of the liquid.</p>
<p>Lilly broke her pause with a smile and took a sip, allowing the drink to flow across her tongue before swallowing it, "Mmm… That's really good." Lilly nodded her approval.</p>
<p>Miley smiled, "I'm glad you like it. I'll get you one." She caught one of the bar staff's attention and a minute later another glass was on the table which Miley pushed towards Lilly.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much." Lilly gushed.</p>
<p>Miley laughed, "Not a problem Truscott." She took another sip from her own drink, "This is what I love about European hotels they never bother to ask for ID."</p>
<p>"That's a pretty good arrangement." Lilly agreed as she felt the warming liquid slip down her throat.</p>
<p>A sandy-haired boy suddenly appeared beside Miley at the bar and Lilly recognised him from the ski lifts that morning, "Hey Miley, get me a beer."</p>
<p>"Get you a beer what?" Miley reproached her brother.</p>
<p>"Get me a beer <i>please</i>." Jackson asked.</p>
<p>"And where is <i>your </i>money?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's err, kind of in my room where I accidentally left it." Jackson mumbled before smiling at his sister in what he obviously hoped was a winning way.</p>
<p>Miley sighed, "Alright, but you owe me for this."</p>
<p>Jackson grinned, "Thanks!" His attention suddenly flocked over in the direction of Lilly who he addressed with a charming smile, "Hi, I'm Jackson, and you must be Lilly? Miley was telling me earlier about your classes…" Jackson trailed off before examining Lilly closely, "Have we met before?"</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, "I think we have if you work at Rico's?"</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact I do." Jackson took his beer from his sister who was noticeably growing impatient with him blocking her from conversation, "I think I remember seeing you around."</p>
<p>Lilly blinked, "That is possible."</p>
<p>"Erm, Jackson," Miley prodded him in the back from behind, "you're kind of inhibiting our conversation here."</p>
<p>"Alright, I'm going! I know where I'm not wanted." Jackson gave Lilly a helpless smile, "See you later, nice to meet you properly."</p>
<p>"See you later Jackson." Lilly replied as the boy slouched off in the direction of the television.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about him," Miley said, "and I'd like to say he's not always like this, but if I did then I would definitely be lying."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed, "It's okay, and I know what he's like anyway. He's already hit on me twice before and can't even remember."</p>
<p>Miley raised her eyebrows, "Oh really? Well, when I next see that boy he's going to have a talking to."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, "It's not that bad. He's not very good at it so I just brushed it all off and that was it."</p>
<p>"That's good to know." Miley said, her eyes moving away to one of the television screens before almost immediately flickering back to Lilly. Miley was now watching her with a quiet intensity that made Lilly shift on her bar stool, correct her posture and sit with her legs in a more lady-like manner. As suddenly as it had begun, Miley's gaze shifted to softness, "So what did you do this afternoon?"</p>
<p>Lilly gulped and took another quick sip of her drink, <i>What is it about Miley that makes me so nervous? </i>"Well I went skiing with my parents and brothers on the baby slopes, and Matt kept swerving near me, so I fell over a couple more times." Lilly looked down with a smirk as Miley laughed lightly.</p>
<p>"Oh dear Lilly, I hope you didn't come out of it too scarred?"</p>
<p>"Nah, I'm alright, just got a couple of bruises, but I'm sure I'll survive. They are a little sore though."</p>
<p>"So no hospital wing tonight then?" Miley teased.</p>
<p>"I think I've just about avoided it." Lilly replied.</p>
<p>"How's your side after that guy wiped you out earlier?" Miley inquired and her eyes trailed down the area which Lilly had previously landed on.</p>
<p>Lilly felt her body tense under Miley's gaze, "It's okay, but I've got a bruise coming out there as well, and it's getting quite big."</p>
<p>Lilly passed her hand over the affected part of her body and Miley watched her movements where, as if acting on instinct, Lilly began to lift the fabric of her light top to show Miley the extent of her injury. She raised her shirt to where the bottom of her ribs started to reveal a long, slender purple mark that was beginning to blossom out with greens and yellows.</p>
<p>"Ouch." Miley breathed, her rolling over where Lilly showed her, "Have you put anything on it?"</p>
<p>"Like what?" Lilly asked, puzzled as she lowered her top to its previous position.</p>
<p>"My dad brought some stuff with us called arnica. It's a cream for bruises which helps them to heal quicker. I'll lend you some tomorrow if you wanted." Miley offered.</p>
<p>"Thanks, I'd really like that." Lilly replied.</p>
<p>"Great." Miley put down her now empty glass for the bar staff to collect and Lilly, finishing hers, copied her action. "Well Lilly, I'm going to hit the hay because I think we've got a long day ahead of us what with attempting a different slope and all. Just when I was getting used to the first one…" Miley grimaced as she leaned back to click her back into place.</p>
<p>"Cool, I'm pretty beat myself." Lilly replied and joined the brunette in standing.</p>
<p>The girls began the steady trek through the hotel to their rooms, starting in the lift but finishing on Lilly's floor, which was a couple of levels below Miley's. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning then, bright and early." Miley grinned at Lilly.</p>
<p>"Yup, nine a.m., so don't be late Miley Stewart." Lilly replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>"I won't be, not tomorrow anyway."</p>
<p>A comfortable pause filled the lift as Miley continued to hold the door open for Lilly, who was very reluctant to leave the Southerner's warm company. Miley's eyes were sparkling as she smiled at Lilly and left the other girl wondering how they should say goodbye. Finally she decided to play it safe, "Sleep tight."</p>
<p>"And you, see ya tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Night."</p>
<p>"Goodnight Lilly." Miley replied; her voice deep and with a husky ring on Lilly's name, which brought on that familiar jolt in the blonde's chest as she backed out of the elevator.</p>
<p>The doors shut and Miley disappeared from sight. Lilly stood and listened as the machinery of the lift set in and began to take her acquaintance upstairs to where she would shortly be going to bed. Lilly sighed and shook her head, "Maybe I should have hugged her?" The blonde wondered to herself as she started her walk down the corridor, "No, that's too weird. I've only really started knowing her for a day." She looked up when she reached her door and slid her card-key down in the lock.</p>
<p>Lilly was still thinking about how she should have said goodnight to Miley when she was changing into her pyjamas. Her excitement when she discovered that she was in the same skiing group as the brunette played across her mind as she brushed her teeth, and when she lay down in bed she couldn't get rid of the image of Miley Stewart's warming smile for anything.</p>
<p>"How could I have never noticed her before?" Lilly asked herself, staring at her ceiling before turning out the light.</p>
<p>Turning over in bed it was the last thought she allowed herself that night before settling into easy dreams of a white sea and dancing mermaids.</p>
<p><i><b>She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>She makes you feel warmer as you're trying to remember what you are</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>She likes to leave you hanging on a wire…</b></i></p>
