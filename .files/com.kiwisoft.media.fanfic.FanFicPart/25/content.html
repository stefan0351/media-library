<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 1 - Mess Hall -->

<P>Seven walked into the mess hall in her usual arrogant demeanor. Of course
that wouldn't be much of a problem if she wasn't also drop dead gorgeous. Half
the guys in the mess couldn't help but steal glances here and there as they went
about eating. More like nibbling, no one wanted to look like a pig wolfing down
a meal in front of her. </P>
<P>What they didn't realize was that Seven was completely aware of the effect
that she had on many of the crewmen, for instance Ensign Harry Kim. He was so
obviously attracted to Seven, that it often amused her to watch him struggle
with his words. Of course it also irritated her because it was so inefficient.
Amusement was one of the many emotions that she had learned while on board
Voyager.</P>
<P>As Seven silently walked up to the counter, the furry-haired Talaxian had his
back turned looking for some Barion Spices he had picked up a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>"Neelix, I require these nutritional supplements." Seven held out the list to
a startled cook who almost dropped the very spices he had been looking so hard
for. "You know, you really should stop sneaking up on me like that. The Doctor
tells me it's not good for the old heart."</P>
<P>Seven looked at him awkwardly. "I apologize for frightening you. I will
announce my presence upon entering all rooms you are present in next time."</P>
<P>"Well I don’t' know if that will be necessary. All I ask is that you don't
just suddenly appear in front of me with a blunt object raised near my face."
</P>
<P>Seven gave him a funny look. "That was a joke" She stated. Neelix laughed and
patted her on the shoulder. "Indeed it was. Now let's see what I can do about
these nutritional supplements the Doctor wants you to ingest." He looked at the
list and began thinking about all the wonderful ways he could put the list of
ingredients together. Unfortunately, the Doctor had a way of always listing the
most unappetizing nutritional supplements possible. </P>
<P>Neelix looked up from the list and motioned Seven towards the tables. "Now go
find a seat and I'll be right out with something new and delicious for your
taste buds." </P>
<P>Unlike her, Seven fought back the urge to tell him that she doubted the meal
would be delicious as he claimed it would be. The last time Neelix said he was
cooking up something delicious, she had to swallow the meal as fast as possible,
as to avoid tasting it for very long. The Doctor had briefed her on being
considerate towards other people's feelings.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Lt. Torres, Seven had a way of being so inconsiderate in
engineering, that she had designed her own holo-deck program featuring the very
Borg that she so despised. In this program B'Elanna would play herself in
engineering, and if Seven got out of line, she would take out all her
frustrations on Seven in front of the simulated staff. Stuff she knew she
couldn't do in real life, because she knew Janeway would have her thrown in the
Brig.</P>
<P>Torres looked up from her soup only to find the beautiful Borg standing right
in front of her. "May I join you Lt. Torres?" B'Elanna was stunned. Seven had
actually asked her, as opposed to just doing it, and having her find out later.
B'Elanna said "Sure," kind of annoyed that the Borg had chosen her of all people
to sit down next to. </P>
<P>After all the battles they had fought in engineering, she thought Seven would
have avoided her at all costs. Apparently Seven didn't take any of B'Elanna's
insults personally, because otherwise Seven would be asking someone else if she
could sit down next to them. </P>
<P>Seven simply stared at B'Elanna, as if expecting her to initiate the
conversation. This annoyed the half-Klingon even more. Seven had a way of making
her nervous, maybe it was the fact that she was so blunt and never sugar-coated
anything she said. "Well, aren't you gonna say something Seven?" B'Elanna asked,
hoping the Borg's stare would waiver, but of course it never did. </P>
<P>"I am curious as to why you were so adamant at being named the leader of this
away mission." Seven stated bluntly. "Oh, so that's what's on your mind."
B'Elanna sounded relieved, as she was almost certain that Seven was curious
about her sexual relations with Tom, again! "Well, you see, I've always had a
thing for green trees, rolling country sides and beautiful sunsets. And this
planet seems to have it all." B'Elanna said almost dreamily. </P>
<P>"I do not understand the human fascination with beauty in inanimate objects
or settings. In fact, I do not understand the human fascination with beauty at
all. It is simply a subjective opinion, most likely learned from one's parents
or social upbringing." Seven sounded off.</P>
<P>"That's exactly your problem Seven. You have to learn to appreciate beauty in
all it's forms. Otherwise what's the point in living?" B'Elanna was so sure that
Seven would give one of those Tuvok like responses, but surprisingly Seven
seemed mystified. "I do not know what the point in living is." She sounded
unsure of herself.</P>
<P>"Wow, for once I got you stumped. Where's that Borg perfection when you need
it?" B'Elanna resounded sarcastically. Seven crooked an eyebrow. "That is
precisely the problem. When I was a drone my purpose to living was defined. Now
I am no longer certain as to what my purpose is.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was beginning to feel slightly more comfortable with the Borg Ice
Queen she had grown to hate so much. Maybe it was the fact that the perfect Borg
had become imperfect and uncertain for the time being. "Well, you could always
say your purpose is to serve Voyager and her crew. But I bet we can think of
something a little less Tuvokian than that. B'Elanna laughed out loud. </P>
<P>"I believe that was a joke regarding Tuvok and his Vulcan logic." Seven
crooked her neck at B'Elanna. "You're damn right it was. And there's a lot more
where that came from." B'Elanna felt like she was Janeway teaching Seven the
subtleties of human behavior. "So the Doctor's been briefing you on how to
recognize jokes. Too bad he didn’t' teach you how to laugh at them." </P>
<P>"I believe you are being sarcastic. It is common for humans to try to mask
their nervousness with humor." Seven was becoming like, well Seven again.
"Thanks for being so observant. Maybe you should stop hanging around Tuvok so
much, I think he has a bad influence on you."</P>
<P>"In what way?" Seven seemed curious. "Well, stating the obvious for one.
Nothing's more annoying than having someone state obvious human behavior. And
you and Tuvok seem to have that down pat." </P>
<P>"I am sorry, I will attempt to no longer state obvious human behavior. I did
not realize that it annoyed you so much." Seven sounded sincere. "Gee, thanks."
B'Elanna was speechless. She had never expected the Borg to apologize to anyone,
least of all her.</P>
<P>At that moment Neelix came stumbling over with a tray filled with all sorts
of weird dishes. "Here you go Seven, something to try out all of your taste buds
in one sitting. "Wonderful." Seven sounded less than pleased. </P>
<P>The familiar sound of the communicator echoed through the air. "Doctor to Lt.
Torres." B'Elanna tapped her communicator. "Torres here, what's up Doc?" </P>
<P>"What's up is that you are late for your immunization before you head down to
the planet. You know that you need the shot a full 24 hours before going down
there. Even with your enhanced Klingon immune system, you never know what kind
of evil viruses lurk in the beauty of those green trees, rolling country sides
or in the air while you watch the sunset." He stated, sounding very upset at
being forced to wait for an unruly and inconsiderate patient. Apparently
B'Elanna had told more than one person how much she was looking forward to this
away mission. Although the warp core was something to behold, her eyes got
rather tired of looking at the glowing cylinder. She needed some real natural
beauty to appreciate.</P>
<P>"Sorry Doc, I lost track of time. I'll be over there ASAP. Torres out." She
tapped the communicator one more time to cut off the Doc's inevitable response
and stood up to leave. "Well it looks like you'll be eating alone Seven. I guess
I'll see you tomorrow in the transporter room." It was Janeway's idea that Seven
be part of the away team. The planet so resembled Earth that she wanted Seven to
enjoy some of it. Initially Janeway was to lead the team but she got caught up
in administrative duties. </P>
<P>B'Elanna said goodbye and left, while Seven had to deal with Neelix asking
how every dish on the tray tasted.</P>
