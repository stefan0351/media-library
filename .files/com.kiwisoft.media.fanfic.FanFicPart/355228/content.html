<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Breaking Point -->

<p>Sam pulled the laces on her Adidas sneakers tight and took a deep breath.  It had been a while since she?d last jogged and she needed to get back into her routine.  She looked around her neighborhood; it was a little after 8 so it was quiet. Everyone was either at work or at school.  Sam had to admit that it was a nice neighborhood.  She and her mother had been welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p>"Going for a run, Spam?" Nicole asked as she headed to her brand new car, courtesy of her newly inherited trust fund.  She hadn?t been kidding when she said that it was a pretty penny.  There was little chance that she would ever have to work for a living thanks to her loving Nana.  The first thing she?s done was buy herself a car.  Now she was out hunting for just the right place for her and Lily.  Sam smirked at her.</p>
<p>"Morning to you too, Satan.  And yes, I am," she shot back.  Sam had been pleasantly surprised.  Living with Nicole hadn?t turned out as bad as she anticipated and the formerly bitchy and self-centered blonde even paid Jane room and board for the room that she stayed in, which Jane never asked for.  Nicole had said that it was the least she could do to help.  Apparently without her mother?s influence to make her angry and bitter, Nicole wasn?t actually a half-bad individual.  </p>
<p>&lt;At least things are working out for someone&gt; Sam thought.</p>
<p>"Don?t strain yourself and pull a muscle or else Brookie might get upset," Nic teased as she started her red 2002 BMW.</p>
<p>"Har har," Sam stuck out her tongue at the car as it drove away.  She was in better spirits since she started seeing Sister Margaret twice a week.  Granted she had only seen the compassionate nun four times so far but having the opportunity to talk to someone outside of the situation was freeing to Sam.  She felt lighter somehow.</p>
<p>She popped Sheryl Crow?s new CD in her Walkman, gave her legs a final stretch and headed off at a slow pace.  She didn?t want to push it too hard since she was slightly out of practice.</p>
<p>With each footfall another chip fell off of Sam?s emotional barriers.  She was trying to free herself from within the fortress she?d built around herself.  And while she knew it couldn?t all happen in one day, at least now she was willing to work at it.</p>
<p>Sam hated the fact that she was so scared of Mike McQueen.  Waking up that morning with Brooke had shown Sam exactly how much power he still had over her life.  And it pissed her off.  She hated that someone else was lording over her like that; pulling her strings and making her dance.  She had never felt such overwhelming panic before and she never wanted to feel it again.</p>
<p>She was disturbed from her thoughts by a car horn frantically beeping behind her, cutting right through her music.  She slowed down and turned around while removing her earphones.</p>
<p>"What?" she shouted at the silver Saab. "I?m on the freaking sidewalk!"</p>
<p>"Sam!  Sam, I gotta talk to you, it?s an emergency!" Tyler Ross exclaimed as he leaned out the car window.  Sam knew what he was going to say before he spoke.</p>
<p>"Mike knows," she whispered in horror.</p>
<p>"Listen, Sam, I?ve got bad news.  One of my dad?s friends saw us out the other night at the movies with Brooke and Cath and he told my dad.  He totally flipped and went nuts.  He?s demanding that I stop seeing Catherine and he?s on his way to Brooke?s dad?s office to tell him," Tyler said in a rush. "I tried to call you at home but there was no answer.  I?m glad I found you.  You HAVE to warn her."</p>
<p>Panic again froze Sam in place as she imagined Mike?s reaction to the news.  She started to hyperventilate as images of Mike taking his anger out on Brooke played through her mind.</p>
<p>"Sam?  SAM!" Tyler shouted to get her attention.  Sam shook herself back to reality.</p>
<p>"Shit, shit, shit.  Can you give me a lift to the school?" Sam asked, her voice trembling.  Tyler nodded.</p>
<p>"Of course.  Get in."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam dashed down the hallway of the school, her sneakers squeaking on the linoleum floor as she frantically tried to remember Brooke?s schedule.  She knew it was either English or Math but couldn?t remember which given the rotating schedule.  She stopped in front of a row of lockers and took a deep breath.  The English hallway and the Math hallway were on opposite ends of the school so Sam knew she?d have to stop panicking if she wanted to find Brooke.</p>
<p>&lt;OK, it?s Wednesday.  Second period.  With the rotation, Brooke will be in?ENGLISH!&gt; She took off again at high speed for the English wing.  She slid to a halt in front of Mrs. Hiller?s room, banging on the door before she ripped it open.</p>
<p>"Ms McPherson! What is the meaning of this?" Mrs. Hiller huffed from the blackboard.</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke questioned as she turned in her seat to look at the flushed girl in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Brooke?need to?talk to?Brooke," Sam panted as she tried to catch her breath.</p>
<p>"Do it on your own time, Ms McPherson.  You may no longer go to this school but Ms McQueen does.  Talk to her after school," Mrs. Hiller advised condescendingly.  "And I suggest that you leave school property before someone has you removed."</p>
<p>"Brooke, NOW," Sam ordered, ignoring the teacher totally.  Brooke nodded, closed her book and stood up to leave.</p>
<p>"If you leave, Ms McQueen, expect a detention," Mrs. Hiller threatened.</p>
<p>"Yeah, OK," Brooke said absently, more concerned about Sam then anything else.</p>
<p>"And where do you think you?re going, Ms Esposito?"</p>
<p>"With her," Lily said simply as she followed Brooke out.</p>
<p>"A week?s detention for you both!" Mrs. Hiller called after them.</p>
<p>"What?s wrong, Sam?" Brooke asked gently.  She had no idea why Sam would be there but whatever it was, it must be bad.  Sam was bright red, panting, bathed in sweat, and shaking like a leaf.  Her brown eyes were impossibly wide against her horribly unnaturally pale complexion.</p>
<p>"Gotta?tell you?" Sam kept panting.  She put her hands on her knees and bent over trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>"Take it easy, Sammy, before you pass out," Brooke advised.  Sam nodded and paused.</p>
<p>"Tyler, came and found me a little while ago.  One of his dad?s friends saw us out with him and Catherine the other night and ratted on us to Mr. Ross.  And now he?s going to your dad.  Brooke, he?s going to know everything!" Sam explained getting agitated again.</p>
<p>"Sam, calm down and start from the beginning," Brooke said trying to soothe her upset girlfriend.  She didn?t like seeing Sam so upset because it scared her.  She put her arms on Sam?s shoulders and could feel the tremors rocking the other girl?s frame.  Now fear raced through Brooke.  She understood enough of what Sam had said to know the situation was bad and to feel Sam?s terror so tangible in her hands added to her own.</p>
<p>"I was out jogging and Tyler pulled up behind me," Sam began slowly, slightly calmed by Brooke?s touch. "He said that one of his dad?s friends saw the four of us at the movie theater the other night.  He told Tyler?s dad, who went nuts on Tyler.  Now Mr. Ross is heading to your dad?s office to tell him everything.  Do you follow me?" Brooke paled.</p>
<p>"Oh my God," Lily breathed as the consequences played out in her mind.  She could still see the scene from Terri?s house clearly and it made her shiver.</p>
<p>"Oh God, Sammy.  Now what do we do?" Brooke asked fearfully as nausea rose to the back of her throat and she pulled Sam in close.</p>
<p>"I don?t know," Sam lamented. "We could run again," she said hopefully.  Brooke pulled away and shook her head.  She stroked the side of Sam?s face with her knuckles.</p>
<p>"No, Sam.  It?s tempting but no.  As scared as I am, there?s no more running," Brooke decided firmly.</p>
<p>"Then what, Brooke?" Sam snapped. "If he gets his hands on either of us?"</p>
<p>"Sammy, please stop assuming the worst," Brooke pleaded.  Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"How can I not, Brooke?  He went for you and Mom.  Broke a bone in my face while he was at it," Brooke flinched at the words.  She traced said cheekbone with the tips of her fingers.</p>
<p>"How can I not worry about what he might do?  What he might be capable of?" Sam finished.</p>
<p>"Sam, he?s my dad.  I have to believe that there?s some good left in him," Brooke argued softly.  Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"I know," she relented. "But I?m scared."</p>
<p>"Me too, love.  But please, let?s see what his reaction is before we panic."</p>
<p>"OK," Sam agreed reluctantly. "But if he so much as glares at you?"</p>
<p>"I?ll run, Sam.  I promise.  And to Hell with him."</p>
<p>"Brooke, are you sure?" Lily asked, breaking her stunned silence.  Brooke gave her a sad look as she hugged Sam again.</p>
<p>"No, Lily.  No, I?m not."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The Palace was eerily dark and quiet when Brooke walked in the door.  There wasn?t a single light on in the entire house, which struck her as odd.  Her heart thundered loudly in the dead silence as she dropped her bag by the door and walked into the living room.</p>
<p>She was petrified.  Despite her words to Sam otherwise, she doubted that there was any good left in her father.  If there were then he never would have acted the way that he had or done the horrible things that he had done.  Simply put he was a narrow-minded, angry little man.  And not at all the man Brooke once thought he was.</p>
<p>"You?re late," Mike?s voice coming from the armchair behind her made Brooke jump a clean three feet.</p>
<p>"Jesus, Mike, you scared me," she gasped.  She looked at her father, glowering at her dangerously as he swirled a glass of what Brooke guessed to be whiskey in his hand.</p>
<p>"A little early in the day to be drinking, isn?t it, Mike?" she asked, putting her hands on her hips and refusing to be intimidated.</p>
<p>"I am your father and you WILL address me as so," Mike demanded in a growl.</p>
<p>"OK, Father," Brooke stressed the word sarcastically.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh well, in for a penny, in for a pound&gt; she figured.</p>
<p>"Is what I heard true?" Mike asked.</p>
<p>"What did you hear?" Brooke answered his question with a question and heard him sigh.</p>
<p>"Have you been going behind my back and seeing?Sam," he choked on her name. "While pretending to see Tyler Ross?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Dad," Brooke replied honestly. "I have." Mike sighed again and took a long swig from his glass.</p>
<p>"Why couldn?t you have just listened to what I said and done as you were told to?" he asked quietly.  Brooke frowned.  It wasn?t the reaction she had been expecting but she?d take it.</p>
<p>"Why couldn?t you have sat down and talked with me instead of trying to run my life the way you wanted to?" she asked in the same soft tone as she sat on the nearby couch.  Mike shook his head.</p>
<p>"You don?t understand.  I?m trying to do what?s right," he began.</p>
<p>"No, Dad, you don?t understand.  I love her.  REALLY love her.  But you don?t want to see that."</p>
<p>"It?s not love, Brooke.  It?s?it?s just wrong," Mike insisted.</p>
<p>"What?s wrong, Dad?  Being gay or being in love with Sam?" Brooke asked.</p>
<p>"BOTH!" Mike yelled, suddenly throwing his glass across the room and making Brooke jump again.  The glass shattered against the wall splashing the liquid all over the rug.</p>
<p>"Geeze, no need to scream.  I?m sitting right here," she mumbled.</p>
<p>"Brooke, being gay is not normal.  And you are the typical, all-American normal girl.  I know this because I raised you to be that way.  I don?t know why you feel this need for attention, which I know is the only reason you?re playing this game."</p>
<p>"You still don?t get it," Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Don?t interrupt me when I?m talking," Mike snapped at her. "You?re only playing this game to get attention but you?re getting the wrong kind of attention.  It?s negative attention, Brooke.  People are thinking badly of you.  And me."</p>
<p>"Is that what really bothers you about this whole thing, Dad?  You?re freaking reputation?" Brooke said exasperated.  </p>
<p>"Brooke, you are NOT gay!" Mike insisted.</p>
<p>"I am NOT having this fight again, Dad.  I AM gay.  I LOVE Sam!  Get over it or get out of my way!" Mike jumped to his feet, causing Brooke to involuntarily flinch and cower.</p>
<p>"DON?T SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY!" he screamed, his face contorted and red.  Seeing Brooke cowering on the couch snapped a little sense back into him and he took a deep breath to calm himself.</p>
<p>"I can?t deal with you being homosexual, Brooke.  I can?t," he confessed finally.</p>
<p>"Why, Daddy?  I?m still me," Brooke pointed out softly.  Mike shook his head.</p>
<p>"You aren?t my daughter.  Not if that?s how you?re going to live your life." Tears started to stream down Brooke?s face.  As much as she despised him for the things he?d done, Mike was still her father and such rejection from her only parent stung.  It hurt almost more than her mother walking out on her when she was a child.</p>
<p>"Why are you making me chose between my family and my heart, Daddy?  It?s not fair," she cried quietly.</p>
<p>"Life isn?t fair, Brooke.  It?s either right or it?s wrong and what you?re doing is wrong.  It?s my job as your parent to make sure you do what?s right," Mike told her.</p>
<p>"Dad, if this is something that you can?t deal with, then why did you come and get me when I left for Texas?  Wouldn?t it have just been easier to let me go?" Mike shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke.  That was a wrong choice that you made that I had to fix for you.  That I am STILL trying to fix.  You tried to take the easy way out to get your own way and I won?t allow it."</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>"And now, this betrayal of my trust.  I let you date and have your life because I thought you understood the rules and the consequences if you broke them.  And now, this?" His voice send an unpleasant chill down Brooke?s spine and caused her heart to leap to her throat.  It wasn?t that she feared physical harm, but whatever was on his mind sounded like it might be disturbing.</p>
<p>"Then just let me leave, Daddy.  Let me get out of your life and have mine," Brooke offered although the thought of cutting ties with her only parent broke her heart.  But he was making her chose and if it came right down to it, Brooke realized that she would chose Sam over her own father.  That realization gave her a lot of sudden clarity about her life.</p>
<p>"Looking for the easy way out again, are you, Brooke?" Mike sneered.  "Just like your mother," he spat and Brooke?s breath caught in her throat.  Mike turned to her and looked at her with such a look of contempt and hatred that Brooke felt her world fall away from beneath her.</p>
<p>"Dad?"</p>
<p>"Mike?until I tell you otherwise, you will call me Mike," Mike informed her rudely and Brooke felt her blood run cold.  Now he was scaring her and she wished Sam was with her for support and help.</p>
<p>"If you thought pulling this stunt meant that I was either A) going to throw you out of the house or; B) going to send you away, think again.  You WILL remain in this house and live by my rules until your eighteenth birthday.  At that point, you can do what the hell you want to.  I won?t give a fuck.  But until then, Brooke Elizabeth, I OWN you.  Do you understand me?" Mike growled, his voice rising in pitch and intensity as he spoke.  Brooke began to shake but at the same time, found herself insulted by his words.</p>
<p>"Excuse you?" she snapped before she could really stop herself.</p>
<p>&lt;Good one, Brooke.  Further piss off the obviously unstable homophobe while you?re locked in the house alone with him.  Brilliant move&gt; she scolded herself.</p>
<p>"You heard me.  You will do what I say, when I say and you WILL not talk back to me.  You WILL NOT see that immoral bitch you refer to as your girlfriend.  She somehow corrupted you to get what she wanted and you are not to even mention her for the remainder of your stay here.  You will also be tutored at home so that you can?t see your ?friends?.  You will NOT leave this house without my express permission or me chaperoning you.  Simply put, when I say ?jump?, you will ask ?how high?.  Are we clear?" </p>
<p>"You have got to be joking!  That?s ridiculous," Brooke scoffed.  Mike advanced on her dangerously.</p>
<p>"Don?t think that I won?t hit you, Brooke.  Your little threat to call the police or whatever doesn?t scare me anymore.  Besides, I can find a lot worse things to do to you than hit you," Mike threatened.  Brooke arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Yeah?  Like what?" she challenged.  She wasn?t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing how scared she was. Mike?s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"Don?t try me, little girl.  Haven?t you ever wondered why your mother REALLY left me?" he hinted.  Brooke frowned in confusion. </p>
<p>"And don?t even THINK about running away again.  Every time you do, I will drag your sorry ass back here and think of worse ways to punish you.  Don?t try me, Brooke.  You don?t want to see what I am really capable of."</p>
