FOUR</b></p>
<p>A firm hand was on her shoulder, shaking her. <i>Why?</i></p>
<p>"<i>Shit!</i>" Miley was scared; her entire body went stiff as she blinked hard.</p>
<p>Thump. Thump. Thump. <i>BAM</i>!</p>
<p>Lifting her right hand, Miley set her hand over her pounding heart and clutched her shirt tightly. Long, slim fingers were gliding through her hair, slowly tangling themselves in her dark curls.</p>
<p>Miley was wet. Completely and utterly wet. She wouldn't be surprised if she had soaked through her pants and left a mark on the couch where she was sitting, propped against a familiar warm body.</p>
<p>The arm that was wrapped around her shoulders wasn't helping whatsoever. Jerking back as those fingers made to tangle in her hair once more, Miley glanced up at the person holding her. Lilly looked back at her, a pensive look on her face.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" Lilly asked softly.</p>
<p>Miley could tell she was confused, and quite frankly, so was she. "What happened?"</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes darted back and forth between hers, not breaking eye contact. "You, uh… I'm not really sure. You kind of blacked out on me. I didn't mean to scare you, but you were pretty out of it."</p>
<p>"Oh." Miley lifted her head and ran a hand through her hair.</p>
<p>"I had just told you that – that you smelled absolutely<i> wonderful</i> and I simply couldn't resist, which is still totally true, and you kind of just… I don't know." Lilly explained. "You zoned on me, and I figured I'd just let you sleep a little more, but then you were jerking and you started sweating. I knew you weren't sleeping because your eyes were partly open. The same thing happened last night, but your eyes weren't open then; you almost flung me off the couch a couple times."</p>
<p>Miley leaned forward and dug her elbows into her knees, burying her face in her hands. She inhaled deeply and let out a slow breath. Sweat was building on her forehead, sliding down her heated cheeks onto her neck; she could feel the sweat sitting on the small of her back, her shirt sticking to her damp skin. Miley sat in silent horror at Lilly's words. Then, Lilly trailed her hand from Miley's back to her back, rubbing the damp material in soothing motions. Miley tensed considerably under her touch, the throbbing between her legs almost unbearable.</p>
<p>It was a dream.</p>
<p>It was a <i>fucking</i> dream.</p>
<p>Miley should've known that Lilly would never be so forward as to touch her like that, especially when her father was on the deck. Straining herself, she could still hear his guitar through the rushing in her ears.</p>
<p>A part of her was overjoyed that it had just been a dream – a day dream? That had never happened before. The other part of her was severely disappointed because of that. She'd thought for sure that it was real, but… Miley knew that the Lilly in her dreams was merely her imagination. The question that had flowed from her lips had been a question Miley had to ask herself. What <i>would </i>she have done if it had turned out to be reality, that her best friend had really made love to her on her big green couch with her father so close by?</p>
<p>Miley's head was spinning, and the dizzy feeling wasn't fading in the least.</p>
<p>Was it so bad that she wanted her dreams to become reality? The answer: yes. Lilly was straight. Hell, <i>Miley</i> was straight – but somehow Lilly had… made her not straight? It was too hard to tell, her head spinning round and round. But she knew that Lilly couldn't know about her dreams, that Miley was attracted to her in a way she'd never been to anyone except her. Lilly was her best friend, and it was kind of creepy with Miley having such thoughts about her. It was creepy and dirty, and guilt rose in Miley's throat, choking her.</p>
<p>"What's going on, Miles?" Lilly asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Could you – could you not touch me?" Miley whispered, her voice was slightly muffled by her hands pressed against her face. Lilly withdrew her hands from Miley as if she'd been burned, setting them in her lap and clasping them together. "Thank you."</p>
<p>Oh, God, how Miley was throbbing, almost to the point of being painful. With the girl she'd just been dreaming about – but then, she couldn't even remember falling asleep – right next to her, looking as if Miley had kicked her puppy… Miley took a deep breath and lifted her face from her hands.</p>
<p>"Miley?"</p>
<p>Miley looked at Lilly, biting her bottom lip hard. "Would you give me a few minutes? I'm… a little hot."</p>
<p>Lilly sighed and nodded. "Sure, go ahead and relax. I'll start making us some food."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lils." Smiling gratefully, Miley reached over and took her hand, squeezing it gently before standing up and bouncing up the stairs.</p>
<p>Once she made it to the safety of her bedroom, Miley quickly flung open the drawers to her dresser and collected clothes to wear. After picking out a simple outfit perfect for lounging around the house and possibly the beach, Miley made her way into the bathroom. It didn't take very long for the shower to warm up, and when it did, she stripped out of her clothes, tossing them in the laundry basket. She stepped into the shower, the warmth embracing her instantly, and slid the shower curtain shut.</p>
<p>Water cascaded over her body, goose bumps rising in its wake. Her hand slid down between her legs, her fingers brushing over her sensitive skin. Closing her eyes, she leaned against the cool tiles behind her and started rubbing herself. She threw her head back as she rocked her hips against her hand, biting her bottom lip almost to the point of bleeding as she stifled her sounds of pleasure.</p>
<p>And then, she could hold in no more as white-hot pleasure flooded her body, and as she screamed out, the name that escaped her lips was that of her best friend.</p>
<p>"God damn." Miley whimpered, withdrawing her hand and emerging herself fully under the spray of the water. She leaned forward and pressed her forehead against the wall beneath the shower head, her fists banging on the wall beside her head. Why had she done that? How could she let herself become so out of control that she'd scream out her best friend's name in the heat of the moment?</p>
<p>"Are you okay, Miley?" Lilly asked. "Did you need something?"</p>
<p>Miley squeezed her eyes shut and stifled a sob. It came out despite her attempt to hide it, and in an instant, the shower curtain was flung open and Lilly was taking in the sight of her best friend, who didn't even attempt to cover herself. Without a word, Lilly reached over and turned the water off. She then grabbed the towel from the counter next to the sink, and opened it. When Miley made no move to wrap it around herself, Lilly stepped into the tub and wrapped it around Miley's wet, shaking body.</p>
<p>"C'mon, Miles, help me here." Lilly muttered.</p>
<p>Then Miley let out a soft whimper and tears slipped down her face, which was scrunched up in anger but shadowed by sorrow. Lilly managed to wrap the towel around Miley's middle, only her arms wrapped around Miley in a hug holding the towel up.</p>
<p>Then, Lilly began to talk softly. "I don't know what's going on, Miley, but I'm sorry. Did I… did I do something to upset you? Is there something else really serious going on, or is Hannah getting to be too much? I just want to know what's going on, because you've practically been a zombie lately. And now you're having a breakdown in the shower? What is going on, Miley?"</p>
<p>Silence fell then, though Miley's gasping breaths were loud and clear to both of them. Miley opened her eyes and stood up a little straighter, her hands covering Lilly's over the towel. "I know you and Oliver are worried, but –" The words died on her lips. There was no way she could admit to what's been bothering her so badly. "I'm just going through this thing. I just need to give it some time, and I'll be fine."</p>
<p>"You've been like this for five months, Miley. Five whole months." Lilly countered, growing angry. "Oliver and I have been waiting for you to be <i>fine</i>, but so far you've been getting worse. So would you mind telling me the truth?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Lilly." Miley whispered brokenly, turning around fully to face her friend, "I can't."</p>
<p>"Come on, Miley." Lilly pushed. "It's me, isn't it? Did I piss you off or something? I did something wrong, and you won't tell me until I realize what I did wrong? Is that it? Don't think I haven't noticed the way you've been acting around me, Miley. I just want to know what the hell I did to make you like this."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to tell you, Lilly." Miley growled. "Just – <i>get out</i>. Leave me alone, Lilly. I'm perfectly fine."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded once and stepped out of the tub. "Okay, then. I want to be here for you, Miles, but if you're not going to let me in, then I can't be. I guess… just call me when you're ready to talk."</p>
<p>Miley watched her as she left the bathroom, and if the slamming of her front door had anything to say about it, her house. Her heart pounded painfully in her chest, each beat causing a crack in her perfectly-crafted façade.</p>
<p>"I have to tell her, don't I?" Miley whispered brokenly to her empty bathroom.</p>
