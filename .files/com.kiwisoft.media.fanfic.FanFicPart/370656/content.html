<p>Viola easily slide off Olivia's panties and was kissing up her inner thigh when there was a loud thud followed by the door swinging open, following that both Viola and Olivia shrieked as Duke screamed.</p>
<p>"What the..." Duke looked down at the newly exposed Olivia and covered his eyes.</p>
<p>"I'll um just be going", said Duke walking out the door with his eyes still closed.</p>
<p>Olivia looked down at the still petrified Viola.</p>
<p>"We have to get him, if he tells anyone..." Viola didn't get to finish as Olivia captured her lips.</p>
<p>"If he tells anyone they'll realize that I'm yours", said Olivia as she pulled away.</p>
<p>"So now your my girlfriend?", asked Viola, beaming.</p>
<p>"Well I was hoping I wasn't a one night stand", joked Olivia looking down at herself.</p>
<p>"There is no way you could ever be anything less than my... beautiful... seductive... loving.. tender..." Viola filled every gap with a kiss but she couldn't continue her flattery as Olivia refused to let go of her lips after tender.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door which made Viola and Olivia reluctantly detach themselves, as Viola grabbed a shirt and Olivia put some clothes on.</p>
<p>"Alls clear", said Olivia, and in walked Duke.</p>
<p>"So... I'm sorry... for um barging in... it.. um", Duke tired to apologize but Olivia cut him off.</p>
<p>"Its okay Duke, just knock next time", said Olivia.</p>
<p>She gave him a quick hug and Duke held on a little to long till he saw Viola's face.</p>
<p>"Right, sorry", said Duke pulling away from Olivia.</p>
<p>"So I'll see you two later, sorry again", said Duke as he made his way out of the dorm room.</p>
<p>"Duke wait", called Viola.</p>
<p>Duke turned back around.</p>
<p>"My friend Yvonne she kind of needs a date and she thought you were cute and all", said Viola trying her best to look cute and innocent in her request.</p>
<p>"You setting me up?" asked Duke.</p>
<p>"No I am merely asking if maybe you would like to go with Liv and me, and Yvonne is coming too, wouldn't want her to feel left out", said Viola.</p>
<p>"Was she the one thatwas flirting with you at the pizza shop?" asked Duke.</p>
<p>Viola immediately glupped as Olivia gave her a questioning look.</p>
<p>"Ah well kind of yeah, the one in the sun dress", said Viola.</p>
<p>"Cool give me a time and I'm there", said Duke as he walked out the door laughing as Olivia thanked him and shut the door.</p>
<p>Viola sat down on the bed as Olivia turned to face her, leaning causal against the door.</p>
<p>"Flirting with another girl behind my back were you?", asked Olivia as she stepped forward.</p>
<p>"In my defense I didn't know you at the time", said Viola.</p>
<p>"And now your smittened with me, right?" asked Olivia as she stepped closer.</p>
<p>"Exactly, besides they are only good friends", said Viola.</p>
<p>"They?", asked Olivia.</p>
<p>"There.. um were two", said Viola cautiously.</p>
<p>"Really?" asked Olivia.</p>
<p>Viola didn't get to respond as Olivia jumped her.</p>
<p>"Tell you a secret", said Olivia whispering in Viola's ear.</p>
<p>Viola nodded as Olivia straddled her.</p>
<p>"I already knew", said Olivia.</p>
<p>"You what?" Viola yelled as she grabbed a pillow and began playfully beating Olivia.</p>
<p>"Stop stop I'll behave", squealed Olivia.</p>
<p>Viola was now lying atop Olivia and gently kissed her.</p>
<p>"You better not", said Viola as she kissed down Olivia's neck.</p>
<p>That early morning the whole dorm could faintly hear, what could only be made out to be "Oh Viola" followed closely by "Oh Olivia".</p>
<p>Duke lay in his bed, glad for both his friends, in another time, he thought he most defiantly would have dated both of them. But that was another time.</p>
<p><b>Authors Note: Should I keep going you tell me... And Merry Chirstmas... also a fact many of you may not know... The DEBS short film, the actress that plays the brunette Amy (lesbian crime fighter, sleeping with the baddie) is none other than the same actress that plays Monique in She's The Man...
