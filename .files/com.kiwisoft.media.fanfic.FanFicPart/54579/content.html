<!-- Accidental Love \ Part 13 -->

<p>"Two percent growth is not what I expected when I hired you for this
			position," Ronnie said, her eyes darting from the report in front of her to the
			nervous manager. The shrill sound of the phone drew a glare from her.
			<i>It had better be
				damn important to ruin a perfectly good chewing out. </i>"Excuse me." She
			reached for the phone before the annoying ring could be heard again. "Veronica
			Cartwright?who??Well, where's Rose? Why are you answering my phone?
			Fine?put her through." She looked at the man seated across from her.
			"That's all for now. I'd better see higher numbers next quarter." She turned her
			attention back to the phone. "Maria? What's wrong?"
		</p>
		<p>Susan was walking down the hall toward Ronnie's office in search of her secretary when
			she saw her sister tear down the hall and head for the stairway. "Ronnie, what's
			going on?"</p>
		<p>"I can't talk now. Gotta go." The door opened and she disappeared, footsteps
			pounding down the metal stairs. The redhead entered her sister's office. "Margaret,
			what happened here?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Ms. Cartwright. Rose called me to come cover for her for a few
			minutes while she ran something down to accounting but when I got here she was gone. I
			assumed she couldn't wait but I haven't seen her since. Funny thing is Wendy called up a
			few minutes ago looking for her."</p>
		<p>"You mean Rose never showed up?"</p>
		<p>"No. I was going to go look for her but then Miss Cartwright's housekeeper called
			and sounded real upset. I put her through to the conference room. Then Miss Cartwright
			came racing in here and grabbed her purse and left. Didn't say a word to me. Do you want
			me to stay here?"</p>
		<p>"No, that's all right. You can go back to your desk now. I'll close up in here. I
			don't think either of them will be back today."</p>
		<p>Once her secretary left the room, Susan looked through the papers on Rose's desk.
			Seeing the folder for the Porsche, she opened it. The receipt on top still showed
			watermarks where tears had apparently fallen.
			<i>Funny, I don't remember her saying
				anything to me about being in an?</i>"Oh my God," she whispered.
			"No." Sitting in the chair, she turned the computer on and logged in under her
			ID. She opened the personnel file and compared the dates to the receipt. "Oh
			Ronnie." The pieces clicked into place and she was certain that Rose had figured it
			out as well. She thought about calling over to Ronnie's house but decided instead to drive
			over. If what she thought had happened, her sister would need her.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>When Susan arrived, Ronnie was on the phone. "What do you mean you don't know
			where she was dropped off? How many women with cats do you drive around
			everyday??Well can you at least tell me if it was a hotel or a bus station? You think
			it was a hotel? Any idea which one? You're a lot of help, thanks," she said
			sarcastically as she slammed the phone down. "They don't know or they're not saying.
			Damn useless cab companies." She looked up to see her sister standing there.
			"What are you doing here?"</p>
		<p>"I thought you might need help." She pulled out the adjacent chair and nodded
			at Maria's motion toward the coffeemaker. "I saw the paperwork for the Porsche on
			Rose's desk. Ronnie, I have to ask. The accident?"</p>
		<p>"It was me," Ronnie answered sadly.</p>
		<p>"And you never told her."</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"So now she's found out on her own and decided to leave you."</p>
		<p>"Looks that way," Ronnie sighed, staring at the phone. "Came here,
			packed a few clothes, took Tabitha and left."</p>
		<p>"Maybe she just needs some time to think about it."</p>
		<p>"I'd say she's already thought about it." She combed her fingers through her
			hair. "She's gone, Susan. She?she left me."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, she'll come back. You two love each other."</p>
		<p>"She thinks I lied to her."</p>
		<p>"You did lie to her," the younger Cartwright pointed out. "Ronnie, you
			have to expect that she'll be upset about this. You hit her and lied about it. I can't
			believe you kept that a secret. How did you think she'd react to finding out? Especially
			after the two of you have?you know?become lovers."</p>
		<p>"I can't be without her, Susan." Her eyes fell on the empty chair which only
			hours before had been filled by Rose eating her breakfast. "I need her." She
			looked at the phone again. "How many hotels can there be in Albany? Maria, get me the
			phone book."</p>
		<p>"I'll help. Where's the phone for the other line?"</p>
		<p>"In the office. Ask them first if they take pets. That should eliminate most of
			them."</p>
		<p>Forty-five minutes worth of calling hotels turned up no sign of her beloved Rose.
			Ronnie was very upset and frustrated by the time Susan came out, a piece of paper in her
			hand and a triumphant smile on her face. "I tried to think like she would. You know
			how she's worried about money. I started calling the cheaper motels and voila, found
			her."</p>
		<p>Ronnie took the scrap of paper and looked at it. "The Barcade? That roach motel on
			Central?"</p>
		<p>"It must be the cheapest motel in Albany that allows pets," Susan replied.</p>
		<p>"I've got to go see her."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, wait." Susan put her hand on her sister's shoulder. "Maybe you
			should call and talk to her on the phone first. You're upset, she's upset. Maybe a face to
			face confrontation isn't such a good idea. What if you get there and she doesn't want to
			talk to you?"</p>
		<p>"She'll talk to me," Ronnie said. "Why wouldn't she? Rose is a
			reasonable woman. I'm sure once I explain what happened, she'll forgive me and come home
			where she belongs."</p>
		<p>"I hope so," Susan replied, not entirely convinced that her sister was right.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie pulled her car into the pothole-ridden parking lot. From the driver's seat she
			looked at the aged and decrepit structure. The dingy cream colored paint was peeling away
			in several places and half the upper level was missing the railing. Dented doors and
			broken windows added to the flavor of the cheap motel. Ronnie was certain that she would
			be able to get Rose to come home with her. She was about to go into the office when she
			saw the familiar orange cat jump into one of the upper level's windows.</p>
		<p>Rose stomped on the roach she saw scurry out from behind the toilet. Tomorrow she would
			call around for another place to stay.
			<i>Knock knock. </i>"Rose?" Ronnie's
			voice startled her. She had not expected to deal with her lover so quickly. Grabbing her
			cane, she walked across the stained carpet and stood behind the door, pressing her
			forehead against the cool metal.
		</p>
		<p>"Go away, Ronnie," she said softly.</p>
		<p>"Rose, please let me in. We need to talk."</p>
		<p>"Please go home. I'm fine."</p>
		<p>"You're not fine. If you were fine you'd be home with me." The doorknob
			jiggled, showing the executive's frustration with talking through the steel door.
			"Sweetheart, please just let me in so we can talk."</p>
		<p>"There's nothing to say, Ronnie. Go home. You don't have to worry. I won't sue you
			or anything."</p>
		<p>"Sue?" The doorknob jiggled again. "Rose, let me in. I'm not worried
			about you suing me. Come on, Honey. We need to talk."</p>
		<p>"So talk. I can hear you." Rose knew she could not open the door. She was on
			the verge of tears as it was and seeing Ronnie would be more than enough to push her over
			the edge. "What did you want to say?"</p>
		<p>A long silence. "I wanted to say I love you. That I want you to come home with me
			and talk about this. Please Rose, I'm sorry I lied to you."</p>
		<p>"Sorry you lied or sorry I found out?" She closed her eyes.
			"Please?just go home, Ronnie."</p>
		<p>"I can't leave without you."</p>
		<p>Rose slapped her hand against the door. "You?you were my knight in shining
			armor, you know. I really thought you had come down and rescued me like a real life
			Cinderella." She did not bother wiping the tears that ran down her face. "And
			all this time you were just trying to protect yourself. What a fool I was."</p>
		<p>"No?Rose, you don't understand."</p>
		<p>"What don't I understand? You hit me, lied about it, made me think that everything
			you were doing was out of the goodness of your heart, then you let me fall in love with
			you." Rose lashed out, slamming the side of her fist against the door. "Damn
			you, Ronnie. Damn you. Why did you let me fall in love with you?" The sobs refused to
			be held back and she collapsed to the floor. "Please go away Ronnie. There's nothing
			left to say." She hugged her knees against her chest and cried.</p>
		<p>"Rose, please." The young woman refused to answer, even when the request was
			repeated several times. Eventually Ronnie walked away, her footsteps against the creaking
			wood drawing even more pain from the young woman's heart. Rose threw herself on the
			threadbare blankets that covered the bed and cried herself into a restless sleep.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Susan walked into the outer office to find her secretary sitting at Rose's desk.
			"How is she?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"She hasn't come out of her office all day," Margaret replied.</p>
		<p>"Are you still holding all of her calls?"</p>
		<p>"Except?"</p>
		<p>"I know," Susan waved her hand dismissively. "Maria or Rose,
			right?" She shook her head and headed for Ronnie's office. Margaret jumped up
			immediately.</p>
		<p>"Ms. Cartwright, I don't think she wants to see anyone."</p>
		<p>"Oh no, Margaret. She wants to see someone. It just isn't me." With that, she
			reached for the door handle.</p>
		<p>"I don't?" Ronnie began, stopping when she saw who it was. "Susan,
			I'm very busy."</p>
		<p>"Busy doing what? Hiding in your office and working yourself to exhaustion?"
			She closed the door and stood in front of her sister's desk. "Ronnie, you can't keep
			this up."</p>
		<p>"Don't start playing mother hen with me. I'm not in the mood."</p>
		<p>"And what do you plan to do? Stay in this depression? Have you looked in a mirror
			lately?"</p>
		<p>The strain had taken its toll on Ronnie. Dark circles under her eyes were a testament
			to the lack of sleep. Her cheeks were drawn, her hair given only the barest of care. The
			sullen woman had taken to spending the night in her office, finding an empty home too much
			to bear. Susan recognized her sister's outfit as one kept in the office closet for
			emergencies.</p>
		<p>"Come to my house for dinner tonight, Ronnie," she urged. "You know Jack
			and the kids would love to see you."</p>
		<p>"No. I have things to attend to here."</p>
		<p>"No word from Rose yet?"</p>
		<p>"She left the Barcade a week ago and checked into the Maverick. Traded in one dive
			for another." Ronnie rubbed her face with her hands. "She must have left
			instructions with the front desk not to let any calls through. They keep taking messages
			but she won't return my calls." Susan nodded, having already known those facts thanks
			to frequent phone calls to Maria.</p>
		<p>"Have you been over to try and talk to her again?"</p>
		<p>"What's the point?" Ronnie sighed. "I did that twice and she wouldn't
			even open the door for me." She buried her head in her hands. "She just keeps
			telling me to go away."</p>
		<p>"Sis, I hate to say this but maybe you should consider moving on."</p>
		<p>Ronnie lifted her head and gave her sister a look of total desperation. "I can't,
			Susan. Don't you understand that she's everything to me?" A tear rolled down her
			cheek. "I need her like I need air or water. I feel so empty without her." She
			turned her head away, angrily wiping away the tears that seemed to form so easily during
			the past week. "What's all this worth?"</p>
		<p>"Hmm?" Susan didn't understand the question.</p>
		<p>"What's all this worth?" She gestured at the reports and papers on her desk.
			"What are gains and ratios and profits worth if there's nothing to show for it?
			What's the precious Cartwright reputation and status worth if the one woman I need most in
			my life won't even speak to me?"</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, you're talking crazy now. You know as well as I do this business has to
			survive and make money."</p>
		<p>"For what? So we can have a few more zeros in our bank accounts?" She stood
			up and looked out the window. "It doesn't mean anything without her."</p>
		<p>"Veronica?" Ronnie wiped her face with her hand before turning to see
			Beatrice standing in the doorway. "I was downtown doing some shopping and I was
			hoping you girls would join me for lunch." She stepped inside and shut the door.
			"What happened to your friend? I thought she replaced Laura."</p>
		<p>"She left," Ronnie said without elaboration. "I'm too busy for lunch
			today, Mother. Maybe Susan can go with you."</p>
		<p>"Well, it's nothing important I guess." She sat down on the leather sofa.
			"So that woman you tried to help left? I could have told you it wouldn't work."
			She looked at her younger daughter. "Those people don't understand what hard work is
			all about. They just want to sit around and collect a check. I suppose she's filed for
			unemployment to pick your sister's pocket some more."</p>
		<p>"Rose isn't like that, Mother," Susan defended. "She didn't quit because
			she didn't like to work. There were other reasons."</p>
		<p>"There's no excuse for leaving a good paying job except pure laziness. It's in
			their blood."</p>
		<p>"In whose blood, Mother?" Ronnie snapped. "The poor white trash that you
			love to talk about?" Her hands gripped the back of her chair, knuckles white with the
			strain. "I'm sure there are people like that, but Rose isn't one of them. She's good
			and honest and would give her last dime to help another person out."</p>
		<p>"Veronica?" Beatrice's tone was low, warning.</p>
		<p>"No. I've had it. You badmouth everyone who isn't a blueblood like us. Rose has
			never
			<i>ever</i> done anything to earn your dislike, yet you treat her like a bastard at
			a family reunion." Seething with anger, Ronnie let loose the words that refused to be
			kept back any longer. "I don't care what you think, Mother, I love Rose and I won't
			have you talking badly about her, do you understand me?"
		</p>
		<p>Susan took a step back, certain that her mother and sister were about to have a royal
			battle of words. Never had any of them stood up to her mother and now Ronnie had just
			announced her defiance on the most taboo of subjects. Beatrice stiffened and pursed her
			lips.</p>
		<p>"I thought that issue was settled years ago or have you forgotten your promise to
			your poor father?" The matriarch now stood in front of Ronnie's desk, her hands
			resting on the mahogany top. "You swore to him that you were through with those
			perverted ideas."</p>
		<p>The strain of losing Rose sapped any tact or restraint Ronnie had left. "You think
			telling me not to love women would make those feelings go away? It didn't. You two forced
			me to promise that no matter how I felt. What is so wrong with loving another woman?"</p>
		<p>"Veronica, think about your position for a minute."</p>
		<p>"Fuck my position!" Ronnie shoved away from her chair and took a step forward
			noting that Susan quickly stepped between them. "Face it, Mother. Your oldest
			daughter is a lesbian. You can't change that so you'd better learn to accept it. Rose is
			my lover and I'll give up everything I have in order to keep her." She lowered her
			voice, the tone deadly serious. "Including my family."</p>
		<p>"Maybe this isn't the best time to talk about this," Susan said, trying to
			guide her older sister away from their mother.</p>
		<p>"No Susan," Beatrice bristled. "It's obvious your sister has decided to
			throw away everything her father and I worked for all these years."</p>
		<p>"Why is it so hard for you to accept?" Ronnie shrieked. "It's my
			life."</p>
		<p>"Mother, there is no reason why she can't be that way and still do a good job
			running the company."</p>
		<p>"Whose side are you on, anyway?" The matriarch turned on her younger
			daughter. "Don't tell me that you accept this, that Jack accepts it."</p>
		<p>"It isn't for us to decide who Ronnie loves, Mother." Susan took a deep
			breath and looked at her older sibling. "And yes, Jack and I do accept Rose,"
			she added.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe this." She walked over the couch and retrieved her bag.
			"I would have thought after poor Tommy's death you would have realized what can
			happen from hanging out with the wrong element. And just how do you think the shareholders
			will feel about this?"</p>
		<p>"It's none of the damn shareholder's business who I'm sleeping with," Ronnie
			snapped. "It's not like they can vote me out of office."</p>
		<p>"You don't own controlling interest, Veronica. Don't forget that."</p>
		<p>"Actually, Mother," Susan interjected. "With Tommy's shares between us
			we hold fifty percent of the stock. All we need is Frank, Michael, or John to vote with us
			and we have controlling interest."</p>
		<p>"So that's it?" Beatrice's lips were pursed, her frustration obvious.
			"Fine. If Veronica wants to throw her life away and you're willing to help her, so be
			it. I'll call a cab from downstairs." She stormed out of the office, leaving the
			sisters alone again.</p>
		<p>"Well that was productive," Ronnie sighed as she sank into her chair. "I
			finally stand up to her and it doesn't even matter because Rose is gone anyway."</p>
		<p>"You know I'm never going to hear the end of this, don't you?" Susan said.
			"I'll guarantee there'll be a message on my machine when I get home."</p>
		<p>"I know, Sis. I'm sorry you had to get in the middle of it." She picked up
			her pen, the present making her heart ache even more for her beloved Rose.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?do you want me to try and talk to Rose?"</p>
		<p>"Do you think it would make any difference? She won't talk to me."</p>
		<p>"I don't think it could hurt," Susan said.</p>
		<p>"I'd make a deal with the devil if I thought it would get her to talk to me
			again." She looked up at her sister. "Please. If you think there's anything you
			can do or say to make her understand how I feel, do it."</p>
		<p>"Which motel is she at?"</p>
		<p>"The Maverick on Central. About eight miles west of the Arcadia."</p>
		<p>"That's almost on the city line of Schenectady, isn't it? The one that puts out
			all those gaudy Christmas decorations each year?"</p>
		<p>"That's the place."</p>
		<p>"I'll go talk to her but you need to tell me what really happened that night. She
			deserves to know the complete truth, not just whatever those papers she found told
			her."</p>
		<p>Ronnie hesitated, then nodded in agreement. "I was out at Sam's?"</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"There you go sweetie," Rose said as she put the plate of canned food down
			for Tabitha. She threw the empty can in the trash just as there was a knock on the door.
			"Who is it?"</p>
		<p>"Susan Cartwright."</p>
		<p>"Um?" Rose looked out the peephole, verifying that the redhead was
			alone. "I'm not really in the mood for company right now," she said softly.</p>
		<p>"Rose, it really is rude to leave someone standing outside the door."</p>
		<p>"But?" Reluctantly she undid the chain and bolt. She opened the door.
			"Susan, if this is about Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Of course it's about Ronnie," the redhead said as she entered the room.
			"My sister is heartbroken and you won't even give her the chance to explain. Hello,
			Tabitha."</p>
		<p>"Mrrow."</p>
		<p>"There is nothing really left to say, is there?"</p>
		<p>"You tell me." Susan sat down on one bed and motioned for the young woman to
			sit on the other.</p>
		<p>"She lied to me."</p>
		<p>"Yes she did?about the accident. Not about how she feels for you. There's a
			difference."</p>
		<p>"How can anything built on a lie be real?" Rose stood up and limped over to
			the tiny cube refrigerator to get some bottled water.</p>
		<p>"Again, she lied about the accident. Everything else was real, Rose. Her feelings
			for you are real and you have to know that."</p>
		<p>"I know she feels something," the young woman responded after she returned to
			her seat.</p>
		<p>"If you could see her, you'd know that she feels more than something." She
			reached out and took Rose's hand. "Listen to me. We're talking about my sister here.
			I know her. She's not one to take people's feelings lightly, especially her own."
			Susan let go and looked down. "Rose, this is killing her. She's not eating, she's not
			sleeping, nothing matters to her now."</p>
		<p>"It hasn't been a picnic for me either," she confessed.</p>
		<p>"Then why not go and talk to her? Come on, Rose. Think about it for a minute. If
			all she wanted to do was cover her tracks, then why did she stick around at the hospital?
			Why didn't she just drop you off and let them worry about taking care of you?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know?maybe she felt guilty."</p>
		<p>"Tell me something Rose, when the two of you, you know?did it feel like guilt
			to you?"</p>
		<p>"No, of course not."</p>
		<p>"Then why do you assume that everything she did came from guilt?" Susan
			smiled inwardly at the confused look on Rose's face. "If she was just guilty, she
			wouldn't have opened up her home to you. She wouldn't have gone to the lengths she did to
			take care of you. Look, I know you're hurting too but you have to look at the whole
			picture. Ronnie loves you."</p>
		<p>"How am I supposed to forgive her?" The young woman asked, her voice cracking
			with emotion. "It's been six months and I still can't walk without pain. I have
			scars."</p>
		<p>"You see this?" Susan rolled her sleeve up to reveal a small white scar near
			her elbow. "Ronnie and I were fooling around on our bicycles and she wiped out
			causing me to fall. I broke my elbow and had to spend the summer in a cast. I still can't
			extend that arm completely and I know whenever it's going to rain now. Do you think I
			shouldn't have forgiven her for that?"</p>
		<p>"Of course not. It was an accident," Rose said.</p>
		<p>"Exactly. It was an accident when she caused me to fall off my bike and it was an
			accident when she hit you with her car."</p>
		<p>"It's not the same, Susan."</p>
		<p>"Isn't it? Tell me something, Rose. Do you think she meant to hit you with her
			car?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Then it was an accident, right? Even if it was her fault it was still an
			accident." She shifted on the bed, trying to find a spot where the springs weren't
			trying to poke through the thin blanket. "What do you remember about that
			night?"</p>
		<p>"Not much," Rose admitted. "I was trying to get home and some men
			started chasing me. I remember running through the park and then onto Madison. The next
			thing I remember is waking up in the hospital."</p>
		<p>Susan nodded, the events fitting with her sister's description. "Did you run out
			from the corner or the middle of the street?"</p>
		<p>"I think it was the middle. It was snowing, I don't know."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie says she was going up Madison when you darted out from between some parked
			cars. She said there was no way for her stop in time."</p>
		<p>"Then why make up the story about coming up after the accident?"</p>
		<p>"She had some wine at dinner and worried she would be arrested for drunk driving.
			Yes, she lied to cover herself but she made sure you were taken care of. She tried to do
			the responsible thing, Rose. You have to give her credit for that."</p>
		<p>"It was an accident," the young woman whispered. "If she hadn't been
			drinking?"</p>
		<p>"She still would have been unable to avoid you. If you're looking for someone to
			blame, blame the men who were chasing you."</p>
		<p>"But why didn't she tell me the truth later?"</p>
		<p>"What happened when you did find out the truth, Rose?"</p>
		<p>The young woman looked at her lap. "I left her."</p>
		<p>"You never gave her a chance to explain, did you?" She reached out for the
			woman she considered her sister-in-law. "Rose, the accident wasn't her fault. She may
			be guilty of bad judgment but not anything else. Do you love Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>Lifting her head to show eyes glittering with unshed tears, Rose replied.
			"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Do you think that she would willingly hurt you?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Then why are you punishing her for something she had no control over? Let me take
			you home, Rose."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie was sitting on the couch, the pendant she had given Rose for Christmas in her
			hands. There had been no word from Susan and the executive feared her sister's
			intervention would have no effect on Rose. Tears feel freely, dotting her hands with the
			salty drops. The sound of the sliding glass door opening drew her attention toward the
			kitchen. When she saw Susan enter the living room alone, Ronnie's heart sank. She opened
			her mouth to speak but there was nothing to say. Rose was gone and she wasn't coming back.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"It's all right, Susan. I know you tried your best." She stared at the
			pendant. "Did she?say anything?"</p>
		<p>"She said a lot of things, but maybe it would be better if you just asked her
			yourself." It was then that the sliding glass door closed, alerting Ronnie that Susan
			was not alone.</p>
		<p>"She's here?" She stood up and quickly wiped at the tear streaks on her face.
			"Is she here?" She sprinted past her sister and into the kitchen without waiting
			for an answer.</p>
		<p>Rose barely had time to set Tabitha on the floor before she found herself caught in
			Ronnie's powerful arms. The cane clattered to the floor as the tall woman spun her round
			and round, hugging her tightly. "You're?crushing?me."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm sorry." Ronnie quickly set her lover down and retrieved the cane.
			"It's just?well?"</p>
		<p>"It's all right," Rose said, reaching out to take the larger hand in her own.
			She was surprised to see such a haggard expression on Ronnie's face. She realized the
			separation had been just as hard on her lover as it was on her. "I missed you
			too."</p>
		<p>"Please don't leave again," Ronnie blurted. She had not meant to sound so
			desperate but the thought of not having the blonde woman in her life was too much to bear.
			"I'll do anything?just don't leave."</p>
		<p>"I can't promise that," Rose said sadly, turning away and leaning her hand
			against the counter. "I have questions, Ronnie. We need to talk."</p>
		<p>"I think that's my cue to leave," Susan piped in from her position in the
			archway between kitchen and living room. "Sis, get Rose's suitcase from my car."</p>
		<p>Ronnie's eyes never left her lover. "Sure?I'll be right back, okay?"</p>
		<p>"I'll be here," the young woman replied softly, giving a wan smile. The
			executive reluctantly opened the sliding glass door and stepped outside. Susan walked over
			and put her hand on Rose's shoulder. "Are you going to be all right?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah," she nodded, turning to face the redhead. "Thanks."</p>
		<p>"Rose, I know she hurt you but don't forget how easily you can hurt her too. Be
			gentle with my sister. She loves you very much." When Ronnie returned, Susan said her
			good-byes and left.</p>
		<p>Once alone, an awkward silence fell over the lovers. They stood in the kitchen lost in
			their own thoughts and fears. Tabitha padded into the room and spotted the unmarred black
			of Ronnie's slacks. "Mrrow?" She rubbed up against her tall mistress and began
			purring.</p>
		<p>"Hey there." She bent down and picked up the happy cat. "How have you
			been? You been taking good care of Mommy?"</p>
		<p>"She missed you, you know," Rose said, moving a couple of steps closer.
			"She kept crying for you and looking at the door." She looked down at the floor.
			"I kept crying too," she added quietly. Ronnie set Tabitha down and closed the
			remaining distance between them just as Rose's lip started to quiver. "It just felt
			like some kind of horrible nightmare that I couldn't wake up from." Ronnie's arms
			went around her just as the young woman collapsed into tears.</p>
		<p>"Okay, Honey. I've got you." She held Rose tight, fearing if she let go she
			would disappear. "Do you want to go sit on the couch and talk?"</p>
		<p>"Sure," the young woman sniffled. "If you want to."</p>
		<p>"Whatever you want to do, Rose. If you'd rather sit at the table?"</p>
		<p>"No, the couch would be nice." The motel room did not have a couch?well,
			not one that she had felt safe sitting on. Hands resting on each other's backs, the couple
			walked into the living room. Rose took her usual cushion at the end while Ronnie
			hesitated, then sat down at the opposite end instead of the middle. To her surprise, the
			young woman scooted over to occupy the empty cushion. Ronnie took it as a good sign and
			rested her hand on Rose's knee.</p>
		<p>"I love you, Rose."</p>
		<p>"I know." She took a deep breath and looked into the blue eyes that haunted
			her dreams. "And I love you too. I wouldn't have come back if I didn't."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry about lying to you. I wish there was some way I could make it up."</p>
		<p>"Do something now?"</p>
		<p>"Anything."</p>
		<p>"Tell me what really happened."</p>
		<p>"Rose, it's in the past. Why can't?" She was silenced by Rose's finger
			on her lips.</p>
		<p>"Because I need to know what happened," she interrupted. "Please Ronnie.
			You owe me the truth."</p>
		<p>The executive nodded and swallowed. "It happened so fast." She shook her
			head, the dark tresses waving with the movement. "It was just so quick." Looking
			into gentle green eyes, she continued. "I never saw you, Rose. I was driving,
			thinking that I had just wasted the evening with a jerk and all of the sudden there you
			were. I hit the brakes but with the snow on the ground?" Her eyes closed briefly
			at the memory of the total silence that preceded the horrifying thud. "There was
			nothing else I could do." She looked away again, focusing on the grandfather clock.
			"There was so much blood, Rose. I thought I killed you. When I realized I hadn't, I
			put you in my car and drove you to the hospital as fast as I could."</p>
		<p>"Why did you stay around?" Ronnie felt a small but insistent hand on her
			chin, forcing her to meet Rose's gaze. "You did your job, you got me to the hospital.
			You could have left and no one would ever have known. Why didn't you leave?"</p>
		<p>"I needed to make sure you were all right. When they didn't think you had
			insurance, they wanted to ship you off to Memorial. I wanted to make sure you got the best
			care and that was at Albany Med so I lied about the insurance."</p>
		<p>"And you were stuck after that?"</p>
		<p>"No. Maybe until I had you sign the papers," Ronnie admitted. "But not
			after that."</p>
		<p>"Then why did you keep coming back?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie gave the only answer she could, the honest one. "I wanted to see you. To
			get to know you better."</p>
		<p>"You know what I remember about those first few days?" Rose looked toward the
			ceiling. "It's mostly fuzzy glimpses here and there, just snatches really. They must
			have been giving me some powerful drugs then."</p>
		<p>"They were," Ronnie agreed.</p>
		<p>"I remember looking up and seeing you." She smiled warmly and looked at her
			lover. "There you were, this wonderful woman telling me everything would be all
			right."</p>
		<p>"You asked me if I was an angel," the dark-haired woman added, smiling to
			herself at the memory.</p>
		<p>"You were to me, you know. You were my own personal guardian angel, looking out
			for me every step of the way. You were my knight in shining armor, my hero." She
			lifted Ronnie's arm and rested her head against the older woman's chest. "I didn't
			know why you took such an interest in me but I was grateful." Her voice grew sad.
			"Now I know."</p>
		<p>"No." Ronnie rested her palm against Rose's cheek. "That first night I
			acted out of self-preservation and fear but don't
			<i>ever</i> think that I pretended to
			care after that." Blue eyes searched green, begging them to understand. "I can't
			explain it but there was something about you, Rose Grayson. I couldn't stop thinking about
			you, and the only time I was happy was when I was with you. I think I fell in love with
			you from that first day you woke up in the hospital."
		</p>
		<p>"What happened to the Porsche?"</p>
		<p>"I had it fixed and then sold it. I couldn't bring myself to drive it again."
			She reached down and began stroking the golden hair cascading over Rose's shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Mm?"</p>
		<p>"When you realized I was falling for you, why didn't you tell me then?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie pulled the young woman closer, holding her secure in her arms. "By the time
			I realized you were falling for me, I had already fallen for you?hard." Taking a
			chance, she leaned down and placed a gentle kiss atop the golden head, pleased when she
			felt Rose lean into it. Turning her head so her cheek rested where her lips had just been,
			Ronnie continued. "I tried so hard to pretend it wasn't happening, but every day I
			fell in love more and more. I was scared that if I told you the truth you'd leave me. I
			couldn't lose you, Rose, I just couldn't." Her voice broke and she had to stop and
			take a deep breath. A gentle squeeze encouraged her. "When you left?when Maria
			called me?" Words failed the executive and she tightened her hold.</p>
		<p>"I didn't know what to do, what to think," Rose said. "It hurt so
			much." Her fingers idly stroked her lover's long dark hair. "But as much as that
			hurt, it was worse not being with you."</p>
		<p>"I love you, Rose." She cupped the young woman's chin and their eyes met.
			"I can't change what happened in the past but I can give you my word that I'll never
			lie to you again." Her thumb brushed against Rose's lower lip. "I know you can
			probably never forgive me for lying, but I love you and I know you love me."</p>
		<p>"I do," the young woman said earnestly. "I've never loved anyone the way
			I do you."</p>
		<p>"You don't know how much I wish that accident had never happened, that you never
			had to suffer through all that pain."</p>
		<p>"But Ronnie?" She kissed the thumb resting against her lip. "If it
			never happened then we wouldn't have met. Sometimes things happen for a reason."</p>
		<p>"Then can we move on from here?"</p>
		<p>"I'd like that." She leaned her head against Ronnie's chest.
			"Honey?"</p>
		<p>The black-haired woman smiled at the endearment and rewarded Rose with a quick kiss on
			the forehead. "Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"Can we just stay like this forever?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie smiled broadly and squeezed her lover against her. "Sure."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"You almost done in there, birthday girl?" Ronnie called from the other side
			of the door.</p>
		<p>"Almost." She fastened the top and looked at her reflection in the mirror.
			"Honey, don't you think this bikini is a bit?revealing?"</p>
		<p>"It's meant to be that way."</p>
		<p>"You're a pervert, Veronica Cartwright, you know that?"</p>
		<p>"Only with you, my dear." Tired of waiting, Ronnie opened the bathroom door
			and was treated to the sight of Rose standing there with only the barest of bikini tops
			on. "Very nice," she drawled.</p>
		<p>"Nice for you maybe," the young woman countered, pulling the yellow bottoms
			on. Gold tufts of hair peeked out from the side. "Great." She pulled them off
			again and headed for the toiletries. "Why don't you go on ahead, Honey. I have to
			take care of something first."</p>
		<p>"Sure you don't want any help? I'd be happy to help you."</p>
		<p>Picking up the razor, Rose smiled at her lover. "If you 'helped' me, we wouldn't
			get anywhere near the pool today." She turned away only to feel Ronnie's arms wrap
			around her.</p>
		<p>"So? Would that be such a bad thing?"</p>
		<p>"You are incorrigible." She turned to see dark eyebrows wiggling lecherously
			at her. "I'm certain this bikini is more of a present for you than for me."</p>
		<p>"You know me so well."</p>
		<p>"Uh uh uh." Rose reached down and intercepted the wandering hands. "None
			of that right now."</p>
		<p>"But it's your birthday. Are you sure there isn't something else you'd like to do
			besides lounging around the pool?" Ronnie tried to resume the playful fondling but
			was stopped once again.</p>
		<p>"At the moment, no," Rose said. "And you already did that this
			morning." She looked from her pubic hair to her shaver and back again. "I'm not
			sure if I need a razor or a weed whacker."</p>
		<p>"Yeah? Try having black hair," Ronnie replied. "The slightest stubble
			shows." Her hand began running circles on Rose's abdomen, steadily heading south.
			"You sure you don't want help?" she queried while nuzzling the smaller woman's
			ear.</p>
		<p>"Isn't this why we didn't get to go swimming yesterday?" She stepped out of
			Ronnie's embrace. "You go take the iced tea out and I'll be down in a few
			minutes."</p>
		<p>Once alone, Rose sat on the toilet and spread her legs to trim the wild patch of blonde
			curls. Her mind wandered over the events of the last year.
			<i>A year ago I was working at
				Money Slasher and didn't have a dime to my name much less anything else. Now look at
				me?sitting in a mansion getting ready to wear a bathing suit and hang out by the
				pool.</i> She shook her head in disbelief. Looking down at her bare legs, she found it
			almost hard to believe that only six months ago they were in casts.
			<i>I wasn't sure I'd
				be able to walk again.</i> As it was, it had been over a month since she left the cane
			behind and it was only when she pushed herself too hard that she felt any pain her legs or
			ankle. The thin scar on her cheek where the stitches once were had faded into a line so
			faint it was barely visible. Still Rose knew it was the one spot most kissed on her face,
			except for her lips, of course.
			<i>I wonder if she even realizes that she does that,</i>
			she mused. It was one of the little habits Ronnie had that she found so endearing.
			<i>My
				Ronnie?I love you so much.</i> Suddenly feeling lonely without her beloved, Rose
			quickly finished trimming her pubic hair and pulled on her bikini bottoms. A hasty run of
			the brush through her hair and she set off in search of Ronnie.
		</p>
		<p>The late August sun beat on the white concrete, causing the barefoot executive to stick
			to the shady areas while bringing the pitcher of iced tea out to the table. The pool was a
			brilliant blue, crystal clear and ready for swimming. Setting the tray down, Ronnie walked
			to the diving board.</p>
		<p>Rose arrived just in time to see her lover walk down the length of the diving board.
			The two piece black thong bikini Ronnie wore hid nothing, much to the young woman's
			enjoyment. Her own pale yellow outfit was a bit more reserved?but not by much.
			Instead of being a thong like Ronnie's, Rose's had a small strip that covered the crack of
			her rear and half of each cheek. The top, however, barely covered her nipples and she was
			certain that once again a smaller size was purchased to make her show more cleavage.
			<i>A
				present for me, hmm? I think it's more of a present for her.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Lowering herself into the shallow end, Rose watched as Ronnie sprang off the board
			again and dived into the water with barely a splash. Soon Ronnie joined her and they
			splashed and played about for a while before retiring to the padded lounge chairs.</p>
		<p>Ronnie used a napkin to wipe the sweat off the outside of the glass before handing the
			iced tea to her.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Hon," Rose said, draining half of the cool drink before setting the
			glass on the side table. "I can't believe how hot it is out here today."</p>
		<p>"The humidity is up," Ronnie replied, wringing the excess water from her
			hair. "Five minutes and I guarantee you we'll be wanting to go back into the
			water." She wiped her brow. "I think I'm perspiring already." She took her
			glass and laid down on the lounge chair, grateful that the umbrella provided shade for
			them against the burning sun. She did not see Rose fish an ice cube out of the pitcher and
			gasped in surprise when it landed on her chest. "Whooo, that's cold!" she
			yelped.</p>
		<p>"I thought you said you were hot?" the young woman grinned. The predatory
			look in her lover's eyes quickly apprised her that she had made a mistake. "Uh oh.
			Um?Ronnie Honey? You know I love you, right? You wouldn't think of seeking revenge,
			right?"</p>
		<p>"Me?" The tall woman feigned innocence, her fingers digging cubes out of her
			glass. Rose found herself pinned to the lounge chair before she could move and several
			cubes were shoved between the yellow bikini top and her skin.</p>
		<p>"Oooh, get them out of there. Oh that's cold." She pulled the top up, freeing
			the ice, which bounced harmlessly to the concrete ground.</p>
		<p>"Well, that was worth the effort," Ronnie quirked, her mouth only inches away
			from the bared nipples made erect by the cubes. "Would you like me to help warm you
			up, birthday girl?"</p>
		<p>"But we're outside." Rose looked around even though she knew no one was
			nearby.</p>
		<p>"Well then I'd better make sure you're covered," Ronnie said.</p>
		<p>Rose gasped as a hand covered her left breast and soft lips claimed the other. "Oh
			Ronnie?Um, wh-what do you think you're doing?"</p>
		<p>"Mmm, loving you," came the muffled reply. Rose found herself pressed back
			against the cushion of the lounge chair and the feelings began to build up within her.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Why am I fighting this?</i> the young woman thought to herself. Reaching between
			their bodies, her fingers found what they were looking for. Soon Ronnie was breathing just
			as hard as she was and Rose was certain they were going to make love right there on the
			lounge chair when the sound of a car pulling up in the driveway caught her ear.
		</p>
		<p>"Damn," Ronnie muttered as she moved off. "Someone's here." She
			grabbed a nearby towel and wrapped it around her waist while Rose fumbled with her top.</p>
		<p>Susan's sons Timmy and John came running around the side of the house. "Aunt
			Ronnie, Aunt Rose!" the younger boy shouted. "Mommy said we could come over here
			and go swimming today, isn't that great?" Ricky had his arms full with the
			PlayStation and obviously was planning on taking over the television for a few hours if
			the number of games he'd brought with him were any indication. John jumped onto Rose's lap
			and wrapped his arms around her neck. "Aunt Rose, would you go swimming with
			me?"</p>
		<p>"Sure Hon, but only in the shallow end."</p>
		<p>"Okay." His little face beamed. "Can Tabitha go swimming with us
			too?"</p>
		<p>Rose laughed at the thought. "No John. Tabitha is a cat. Cats don't like
			water."</p>
		<p>"Speak of the devil," Ronnie said, nodding her head in the direction of the
			house. The sliding glass door had been left open and the curious feline wandered out in
			search of new worlds to conquer. She looked at the boys. "Why don't you two go get
			changed. There are towels in the pool house." She turned to Rose. "You think you
			can handle things out here?"</p>
		<p>"Sure." She scooted the boy off her lap. "John, I think there's a ball
			in the pool house that we can play with. See if you can find it, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay, Aunt Rose." He followed his brother away from the pool. Ronnie watched
			them leave. "Looks like we're going to have company for a while."</p>
		<p>"Seems that way," the young woman agreed as she stood up. "Why aren't
			they using their own pool?"</p>
		<p>"Susan said something about her pump breaking. Sorry Hon, " she said
			apologetically. "I know it's your birthday and all, but?"</p>
		<p>"No, it's fine that they're here," Rose said. "I just wish I was wearing
			something else. I feel really naked in this." She tugged at the thin strap of her
			bikini top.</p>
		<p>"I'll get you a tee shirt."</p>
		<p>"Make it one of yours or else bring a pair of shorts with you too." Covering
			herself with the towel, Rose greeted Susan and Jack as they approached.</p>
		<p>Ronnie returned a few minutes later carrying one of her tee shirts. She had changed
			from her two piece bikini to a more appropriate black one piece that covered most of her
			rear and provided very little cleavage.</p>
		<p>"Is that your family get-together suit?" Rose asked when her lover reached
			her side.</p>
		<p>"You think I want to be the subject of my nephew's fantasies?" she asked
			while handing over the tee shirt. "Hi Susan." She turned and nodded at her
			brother-in-law. "How are you, Jack?"</p>
		<p>"Fine, Ronnie, and yourself?"</p>
		<p>"Perfect," she said, flashing a smile at Rose. "Well, since you're here,
			why don't we have a barbecue? It won't take long to heat up the grill and I'm sure we have
			something that isn't frozen."</p>
		<p>"Sounds good," Susan said, sharing a wink with her sister when Rose was not
			looking. "It's just a lazy day and you two weren't planning on doing anything, were
			you?"</p>
		<p>"No," Ronnie replied. "I'll go look and see what we have that we can
			grill up."</p>
		<p>An hour later Jack was busy tending the grill while the women and boys played around in
			the water. Timmy and Ronnie raced each other across the length of the pool while Rose and
			John splashed around in the shallow end, occasionally playing with the brightly colored
			beach ball. When the young woman asked Ronnie where Susan was, she received a vague answer
			about the redhead not being a swimmer. John's fair skin showed signs quickly of turning
			pink and when Rose offered to take him inside, Ronnie stepped up and said she had to go
			get something anyway. A few minutes later Jack came over to the pool and whispered
			something in Timmy's ear, causing the boy to exit and head inside, leaving Rose as the
			only person in the water.</p>
		<p>Feeling awkward, she climbed out of the water and wrapped herself in a towel, thinking
			to herself that Ronnie had been gone too long. She was headed for the house when Jack
			stopped her. "Rose, come take a look at these steaks and tell me what you
			think."</p>
		<p>"Sure." She moved over to the grill and looked at the various pieces of meat
			sizzling over the gas fire. "I hope everyone's hungry. You made quite a bunch here.
			They look fine, though. Maybe a few more minutes."</p>
		<p>"Could you keep an eye on them for me? I have to visit the little men's
			room." He handed her the turning fork and walked away.</p>
		<p>Ten minutes later the steaks were done and there was no sign of Ronnie or anyone else.
			Rose carefully piled the food on a plate and shut the grill off. "Where is everybody?
			I thought we were having a cookout," she said to the empty air.</p>
		<p>Inside the living room, Susan was supervising the hanging of the final decorations.</p>
		<p>"Up a little," the redhead said. "No, that's too high. Bring it down a
			bit." Ronnie stood on one of the upper rungs of the ladder, thinking that her sister
			was a pain in the ass when it came to decorating. The banner was perfect where it was
			before but Susan insisted it would better if it were up just a foot. John, Ricky, and
			Timmy were busy running multi-colored rolls of streamers around the living room.</p>
		<p>"We have to hurry up or she'll see it," the executive grumped. She spared a
			glance at her watch. "Where's Maria, anyway? She was supposed to be here with the
			cake a half-hour ago."</p>
		<p>"She'll be here, and if you'd just make it level, we'll be done," Susan said.
			They turned at the sound of the door sliding open. Ronnie shoved the thumbtack through the
			banner and stuck it to the wall, hopping off the ladder just as Rose stepped through the
			archway.</p>
		<p>"Happy Birthday Rose!" They shouted, echoing the words printed on the banner.
			The young woman stood there speechless, her eyes wide with surprise. While she had thought
			it odd no one except Ronnie had wished her a happy birthday, she chalked it up to them not
			knowing. She had never guessed Ronnie would give her a party. John tugged on her wet
			shirt. "Aunt Rose, does this mean I can give you your present now?"</p>
		<p>"In a little while, John," Susan said, shooing her son away. "We have to
			eat first."</p>
		<p>"Um?uh?oh my." Rose turned her shocked expression to her lover.
			"You planned this?"</p>
		<p>"Maria's on her way with your cake and I think Frank and Agnes are stopping by
			later," Ronnie replied, crossing the room to stand in front of the overwhelmed woman.
			"Happy birthday, Honey."</p>
		<p>"It's been so long since anyone gave me a party for my birthday," Rose
			whispered. "I can't believe this."</p>
		<p>"Believe it. You can count on this being an annual occurrence from now on."
			She looked at the boys. "You guys go help your father make up the plates." Once
			they left the room, she turned her attention back to Rose. "I love you. You didn't
			think I'd let your birthday go by without throwing you a party, did you?"</p>
		<p>"You didn't say anything except about the bikini so I thought?" She
			shook her head and smiled. "I should have known. Cartwrights love parties."</p>
		<p>"Well, that may be true, but this particular Cartwright had more of a reason to
			throw you a party than just your birthday." At the quizzical look, Ronnie merely gave
			a sly smile. "You'll see later. Come on, go get changed into something dry so we can
			dig into dinner before it gets cold."</p>
		<p>Maria arrived a short time later, the back seat of her car taken up with a large sheet
			cake. Ricky and Timmy got their fingers full of frosting before Ronnie could get it placed
			up out of reach. John insisted on sitting on Rose's lap during dinner and the sight made
			Ronnie smile. The people who meant a great deal to her were there to help celebrate the
			birthday of the person who meant the most to her. Not a word was said when Maria joined
			them for dinner and the atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable. Little side conversations
			took place all around her but the executive paid them no attention. Her focus was on the
			green-eyed beauty and the thought of the present hidden in the office.</p>
		<p>Frank and Agnes arrived just as dinner was ending. Rose had to laugh at the sight of
			the big burly man carrying a fishing pole wrapped in dainty tissue paper.</p>
		<p>"Gee Frank, I have no idea what you got her," Ronnie said with a smirk.</p>
		<p>"You know fishing poles aren't the easiest things in the world to wrap," he
			replied. "Took Agnes forever to get it done." He walked over to Rose and gave
			her a kiss on the cheek while handing her the present. "Happy birthday,
			Blondie."</p>
		<p>"I guess it is time to open presents," Ronnie announced.</p>
		<p>"Well here, open mine first," Frank said.</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful," Rose said as the final wrapping was removed.</p>
		<p>"That's not just some run of the mill fishing pole you've got there,
			Blondie," he said. "That's a top of the line Power Pole with ultra sensitive tip
			and left handed reel. Maybe next time you go fishing you won't toss the lunkers back
			in."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I probably will," she admitted. "But it sure is fun to catch
			them."</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't know. I've caught more sunfish than bass this season," he
			grumbled good-naturedly.</p>
		<p>"Aunt Rose, will you open my present now?" John asked, holding the gift in
			his hands.</p>
		<p>"Of course I will, Sweetie," she said, taking the present from him. The
			wrapping was torn away to reveal a bottle of her favorite perfume. "Thank you, John.
			It's very nice." She gave the young boy a kiss on the cheek. Looking up at Susan, she
			indicated her silent thanks with her eyes. Timmy and Ricky gave her presents as well,
			followed by a joint present from Susan and Jack while Maria gave her a brooch that was
			simply breathtaking.</p>
		<p>After seeing the presents the other Cartwrights had given her, Rose knew the bikini was
			not the only present her lover had in store for her. Her suspicions were confirmed a
			minute later when Ronnie and Frank disappeared into the office.</p>
		<p>Together they carried out a big, bulky looking box covered in green wrapping paper.
			Jack and Ricky moved everything off the coffee table to make room. Rose stood up and
			smiled. "Thank you," she said. "I wonder what on earth it could possibly
			be? Looks kinda big." The box was easily as long as her outstretched arms and half as
			high.</p>
		<p>"Looks can be deceiving," Ronnie replied, sharing a knowing grin with her
			sister as Rose began to unwrap the large box. While the box itself proclaimed that a
			twenty-seven inch color television was waiting inside but the young woman knew from the
			weight it was not the case. Besides, there were already a half dozen televisions floating
			around the house as it was. Surely Ronnie would not have bothered to buy another one. Her
			curiosity was piqued when she opened the box to reveal another box inside, this one
			wrapped in red holiday paper. "I ran out of birthday wrap so I used Christmas paper.
			I hope you don't mind."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, you could have wrapped it in newspaper and I wouldn't have minded,"
			Rose assured, pulling the smaller box out. Ricky moved the first box out of the way. The
			red box was unwrapped and opened only to discover another box inside. "Oh, blue paper
			this time."</p>
		<p>"Wouldn't want you to be bored with the same old paper," Ronnie joked. Two
			more boxes with different colored papers had the boys in fits of laughter and the adults
			chuckling. "I can't watch this," Frank said with a huge grin on his face.
			Tabitha was having a grand time playing with the paper as it fell to the floor. "How
			many boxes did you wrap?" Rose asked after the sixth box opened only to find another
			one waiting inside.</p>
		<p>"Oh, a few more." The devilish grin and wiggling eyebrows sent Susan's sons
			into renewed giggles. Finally a coat box wrapped in silver paper with gold ribbons was
			revealed. "That's got to be it," Frank said. Jack and Susan nodded in agreement.
			With all the excitement of a child, Rose opened the box to reveal a bright green and black
			ski jacket. "Oh, it beautiful," she said, pulling it out of the box and holding
			it up for all to see.</p>
		<p>"That is nice, even if it is a bit early for snow," Susan said. Rose was
			already standing up to try it on. It fit perfectly. "Sharp," Ricky said. John
			added a request for one in the same colors. Ronnie merely stood back and smiled at the
			image before her. "It may be early for snow here but not everywhere." The corner
			of her lip curled up with a smile. "Rose, what's in the inside pocket?"</p>
		<p>"The inside?" She unzipped the jacket and pulled out a stack of papers.
			The bright stripes on the outer paper left no doubt as to its contents.</p>
		<p>"I hear the Alps are just lovely this time of year," Ronnie drawled. "I
			do believe we both have some vacation time stored up."</p>
		<p>"Oh my, tickets to Switzerland?" Rose's fingers trembled as she pulled not
			two but ten tickets out of the sleeve. "Ronnie?" Her voice stilled as the
			names of several far away countries appeared before her eyes.</p>
		<p>"I believe Germany, Austria, and France are in there too, aren't they?" the
			executive teased just before an overjoyed Rose flew into her arms.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, you are something else," her sister said.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe you," Rose whispered into the warm skin of her lover's neck.
			"This is too much."</p>
		<p>"Nothing is too much for you, Honey," she whispered back. "We'll bring
			the laptop and write it off as a business expense." That made the woman in her arms
			chuckle. "Seriously, I would love to take you on a tour of Europe and this is the
			perfect time of year to go."</p>
		<p>"I love you."</p>
		<p>"Love you too. You're not crying on me again are you?" Ronnie stepped back to
			see that indeed her lover was weeping with joy. Susan came up alongside them and silently
			held out a handkerchief.</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Rose took a few seconds to compose herself before turning to
			face the rest of the guests. Maria came up to give the young woman a hug. "What a
			beautiful gift," the housekeeper said.</p>
		<p>"It is very nice," Agnes said, shooting her husband a look. "It seems
			some people would rather spend time with the ones they love instead of running off to some
			lake in the middle of nowhere for two weeks."</p>
		<p>"Umm?" Frank looked at his cousin for support and found none as she was
			too busy beaming at the happiness on Rose's face. "Oh hell, Agnes. I guess two weeks
			in Hawaii won't be so bad."</p>
		<p>"I knew you were a big softy," Ronnie teased.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, just like you, Cuz," he countered good-naturedly. Looking down at her
			lover, the executive could only nod in agreement.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>After the last of their guests left, the happy couple retired to the living room.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe you did this," Rose said softly, looking at the tickets
			sitting on the coffee table.</p>
		<p>"Why not?" Ronnie shrugged. "Now that you don't need a cane and physical
			therapy is over, it's a perfect time for us to take a nice long vacation." Although
			she had been to many of the countries already, she knew the memory would pale to the new
			ones that would be created with Rose by her side. Looking at the jacket, Ronnie smirked to
			herself. Not every present had been opened yet.</p>
		<p>Rose kicked her shoes off and tucked her feet up under her legs. "How did you
			manage to plan a vacation without me knowing?"</p>
		<p>"Easy. My travel agent did the work. All I did was tell her what countries I
			wanted to visit. One phone call, a couple of emails and voila."</p>
		<p>"You are amazing." Rose rested her head against her lover's chest. "I've
			only dreamed of going to places like that," she said wistfully.</p>
		<p>"Well now your dreams will soon be a reality," Ronnie replied. She leaned
			down for a quick kiss. "I'm glad you liked your presents."</p>
		<p>"I love them and I love you," she replied. "You didn't have to do
			this."</p>
		<p>"It makes me happy to make you happy. You know that." The phone rang, causing
			Ronnie to mutter a curse and reach for the receiver. "Cartwright Residence."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Mother?" Turning to face Rose, she raised her eyebrows to indicate her
			surprise. It had been almost two months since they had spoken. "Um?how are you?
			Really??How did that go??uh huh, what about it??Yeah, she was here
			earlier?It's Rose's birthday." Ronnie's eyes grew wider. "Uh?yes, it
			was nice?.uh huh?no, no problem at all, Mother?What??Um?yes, I'm
			sure that'll be fine?of course?okay Mother, good-bye." She set the phone
			down.</p>
		<p>"She just called to say hello."</p>
		<p>"Really?" Rose reached out and put her hand on Ronnie's shoulder. "Is
			everything all right?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah," she nodded. "She just said that we should come over for dinner
			this Friday."</p>
		<p>"Us?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, us," Ronnie said. "I don't get it."</p>
		<p>"Maybe it's your mother's way of offering an olive branch."</p>
		<p>"But after everything that's happened?"</p>
		<p>"After everything that's happened, you're still her oldest daughter," Rose
			said. "She really said both of us?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah." Ronnie shook her head and pulled her lover close. "I don't
			believe it, but I'm not going to fight it. Maybe everything will work out with us."</p>
		<p>"You are wonderful."</p>
		<p>"You think so, hmm?" Ronnie's heart began beating faster. "We may not
			have started out in the best of ways but I can't imagine my life without you."</p>
		<p>"I feel the same way."</p>
		<p>"I'm glad to hear you say that." Her face became serious. "I think you
			missed something in your jacket pocket."</p>
		<p>"What? After all this?" Rose held her hands out to indicate the stack of
			presents and the airline tickets. She picked the jacket up and laid it on her lap. As her
			hand fell over the pocket she felt the hard object hidden within. "Ronnie?" Her
			fingers traveled over it, her eyes widening. "Is this what I think it is?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know," the executive replied nervously. "Maybe you should open
			it up and find out." As the zipper was opened, she added, "I hope you like
			it."</p>
		<p>Rose's hand trembled as she pulled out the small velvet box. Tears were already
			beginning to well up in her eyes. "Oh my?" Her hands shook even more and
			Ronnie had to steady them with her own.</p>
		<p>"Open it, Rose."</p>
		<p>The jewelry box opened to reveal a gold band adorned with a triple row of diamonds
			across the top. "Oh?" Ronnie's equally shaky fingers removed the ring from
			the box, turning it around for her to see the inscription.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<i>To my Rose, love forever, Ronnie</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Rose Grayson, would?" Her voice cracked, forcing her to swallow and
			start over. "W-would you be mine?forever?" The young woman could not find
			her voice and had to give a shaky nod, tears of happiness streaming down her face. "I
			love you," they said at the same time. Holding the ring between her fingers, Ronnie
			took the smaller hand in her own. Tears fell from her own eyes as the gold band slid over
			Rose's ring finger. As it passed over the last knuckle their fingers intertwined and both
			tried to bring the joined hands to their lips. Ronnie used her strength to gently press
			her lover back down on the cushions while their fingers separated. Rose's hands went to
			the hem of Ronnie's shirt and slipped beneath.</p>
		<p>"I love you, Rose."</p>
		<p>"And I love you, Ronnie," she replied before their lips met.</p>
		<p>Lying on the floor, Tabitha looked up at her mistresses. With a healthy stretch and a
			yawn, the cat stood up and headed for the stairs. She would have the bed to herself for
			the night.</p>
