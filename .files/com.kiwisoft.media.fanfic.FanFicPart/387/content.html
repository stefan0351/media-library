<p>"Stupid boxes", I mutter when one of them nearly falls on my
	head. I catch it in the last moment. 	The upstairs storage
	closet... it's a scary place. Lots of history here. Most of
	mom's stuff is here, she didn't take a lot with her. But
	I'm a big girl now. I can take it.</p>

	<p>I push the rebel box back to it's place and take a step back. My
	gaze roams along the upper shelf as I place my hands on my hips.
	Thankfully dad has labeled the boxes clearly. Clothes, magazines,
	stuff... stuff? Maybe it's in there.</p>

	<p>I stand on my toes and carefully remove the middle box. My mouth
	twists into a grin when the first thing in the box to catch my eye is
	the old photograph. I look so CUTE in that! That'll teach Sam to
	doubt my words.</p>

	<p>I set the box on the floor, and kneel beside it. The picture is even
	better than I remembered. Picking it up with frames and all, I smile
	at the memories. Not all the memories of mom are bad. I glance
	into the box again and spot her camera. The very camera she used to
	take this picture probably. How come she left her camera home?
	Photographing was the one thing she did well.</p>

	<p>I put down the photo and retrieve the camera. Mom took great
	pictures. It all comes back to me now. Days spent walking the sunny
	streets, looking for something to shoot. Moments worth freezing in
	time.</p>

	<p>I flick on the power and am slightly surprised, when it actually does
	come on. There's a half full film in it. The last pictures she
	ever took here...</p>

	<p>I pick up the old photograph and shake my mind free from the past.
	The camera has given me another brilliant idea. I hurry out
	of the closet and close the door behind me.</p>

	<p>Outside Sam is just making her way upstairs. Perfect, "Sam, wait
	up!"</p>

	<p>She turns to look at me and frowns when she finds me grinning,
	"What?"</p>

	<p>"I've got the picture", I answer, waving it in the air.</p>

	<p>"What picture?", she gets even more confused.</p>

	<p>Oh, great. She doesn't even remember anymore! And I spent almost
	ten minutes looking for it!, "What do you mean, what
	picture?", I ask a little offended, "The one that proves I
	was way cuter than you as a child."</p>

	<p>"Brooke...", she chuckles, "I've seen your childhood
	pictures before", she says spreading her arms and shaking her
	head, "There's no way you were cuter than me."</p>

	<p>"You haven't seen this one", I say cockily and walk up to
	her, "Even I was amazed at how great I looked. I mean, I
	must've been the most perfect child ever. I must've."</p>

	<p>She grins and grabs the picture when I hold it out. I grin
	back, "Okay Brooke. I think this game has gone far enough.
	It's bringing out a very unpleasant side of you", Sam says
	and looks at the photo, "Although it's a good photo."</p>

	<p>"So I win?", my grin is even wider now. Sam only smiles and
	hands the picture back, "Oh, you can keep it", huh? Why did I
	say that? Why would she want my picture anyway?, "A... as a...
	reminder, you know."</p>

	<p>She frowns and looks at me weirdly for a while. And then
	shrugs, "Okay", Sam says and lowers her hand back down,
	"What's with the camera?"</p>

	<p>"Oh! Oh!", I get exited all over again, "You have to be
	my model!"</p>

	<p>"Your model?", she frowns again, "I don't think so
	Brooke."</p>

	<p>"You have to Sam", I start to whine when she turns to leave,
	"I need a model!", she takes a few steps towards her door,
	"Saaam! You have to!", I grab her hand.</p>

	<p>She flings around, "What's wrong with you Brooke? Where did
	you get that camera anyway?"</p>

	<p>Sam's not gona agree easily. I decide to play my pity card,
	"It was my mom's", I say quietly bowing my head, "She
	took really great photos and I just... wanted to see if I could do it
	too."</p>

	<p>"Oh", she says, and I can hear an apology coming. She feels
	bad. A grin starts to form on my mouth, "I didn't know. Maybe
	I could let you...", I burst out giggling in the middle of her
	sentence. She stops talking and just watches me for a few
	seconds, "Great Brooke", she nods.</p>

	<p>"I'm...", I try to talk through the laughing,
	"I'm sorry Sam..."</p>

	<p>"Get yourself another damn model!", Sam snaps.</p>

	<p>"No, I really am sorry", I quickly try to erase the damage,
	"I didn't mean anything bad."</p>

	<p>"No, you just like manipulating people", she says and turns
	to leave again.</p>

	<p>"Sam...", I call after her. She's almost in her room when
	I shout, "I'll pay you!"</p>

	<p>Sam stops at the door and slowly turns her head, "How much?"</p>

	<p>"Well, I don't really have a lot of money right now...",
	she takes a step further away, "But I'll do anything you
	want!"</p>

	<p>She stops again, "Anything?", I nod. And she starts to grin,
	"Fine."</p>

	<p>"Well, I didn't mean anything as in ANYTHING...", I start
	to take back my words.</p>

	<p>"Too late Brooke. Let's shoot."</p>

	<p>I get a little nervous from the grin and the quick change of heart.
	Hope she doesn't make me do anything too horrible. But I quickly
	shake off the bad thoughts. At least I got what I wanted, a model.</p>

	<p>"Okay", I say, "Come on, you can borrow my clothes."</p>

	<p>"Why can't I wear my own?"</p>

	<p>"Because Sam", I lead the way into my room, "You
	don't have a decent piece of clothing in your wardrobe."</p>

	<p>Sam follows me a few steps behind. I hear her chuckle, "Keep on
	insulting me. I'll be sure to remember it when I'm deciding
	your fate."</p>

	<p>I smirk at her and nod towards my closet, "Try the short black
	one. I think it'll look good on you."</p>

	<p>"You've been imagining me in short black dresses?", Sam
	disappears into the wardrobe.</p>

	<p>"Short black dresses, long blue dresses", I answer while
	familiarizing myself with the camera, "No dresses", the last
	one just leaves my mouth when I'm not thinking. My head jerks up
	and I find Sam staring at me from the door.</p>

	<p>"No dresses?", she says tilting her head.</p>

	<p>I blush and quickly return to study the incredibly interesting piece
	of equipment in my hand, "Uh...", I mumble, "Yeah... I
	meant to buy you this swimsuit for your birthday, and I tried to
	picture how it would fit you", good cover Brooke! Great even.</p>

	<p>Sam stands there dumbfounded for a moment, "You are weird",
	she says and disappears into the closet.</p>

	<p>Yes I am. Even though I sometimes picture Sam in various stages of
	undress, I still didn't have to tell HER that!? God! What the
	hell is going on in my mind?</p>

	<p>I wait and nervously play around with the camera, "This is really
	short, Brooke", Sam finally calls out.</p>

	<p>"So?", I answer, "Just come out, so we can get
	started."</p>

	<p>"But this is REALLY short", she says from the doorway.</p>

	<p>I turn to look at her and my jaw drops, "Sam...", I manage to
	utter with great difficulty.</p>

	<p>"What?", she gets confused and starts to look around
	what's wrong.</p>

	<p>"Uhm...", I mumble, still searching for the right words,
	"That's a night gown", I finally force out nodding my
	head a couple of times.</p>

	<p>Sam's mouth also opens wide, as she proceeds to gawk at me. It
	takes a few seconds for her mind to catch up, "Oh... I knew
	that", she says trying to sound sure of herself. I know she's
	lying though. Too proud to admit making a mistake. But if she wants
	it that way, I'm game.</p>

	<p>"You did?", I ask and grin, "I was aiming for a more of
	a... classic look, but I guess we can do sort of lingerie catalogue
	thingy."</p>

	<p>Sam glares at me and her face turns a little redish. She has talked
	herself into a dead end, "Are you sure Brooke? Cause you know,
	I'm thinking that underwear models get PAID a lot more."</p>

	<p>I just chuckle a little, "You look so hot in that, it'd be a
	shame to waste it", I say and look her up and down. Sam blushes
	even more and starts to fidget around. But I don't wanna go too
	far, "Tell you what Sammy. We'll take a few photos of you in
	that, and then you can choose the next clothes yourself", I
	continue in a more settling tone, "Anything you want."</p>

	<p>Sam thinks about it for a while and shrugs then, "Whatever",
	she says and walks a little closer, "Where do you want me?"</p>

	<p>"How about on my lap?", I talk way too fast again, and
	grimace at my own stupid statement.</p>

	<p>Sam scowls, "I'm changing", she says and walks back into
	the closet.</p>

	<hr></hr>

	<p>I anxiously rip open the envelope with a big smile on my face.
	I'm feeling real giddy, the photo session turned out to be great
	once we got it underway. Sam relaxed when she got into more
	comfortable clothes. But the same flirtatious mood lasted through the
	entire thing. I don't know where it came, but it was a lot of fun.</p>

	<p>"I'm wearing jeans and this cashmere sweater, which by the
	way is now my reward", she yelled out at one point, "Live
	with it." </p>

	<p>I almost began to protest, the sweater is one of my favorites. But
	when she walked out and I saw how good she looked, I couldn't
	really argue.</p>

	<p>My smile disappears when I see the first photograph. It's one of
	mom's pictures. There's a small boy on a bike, gawking like
	an idiot. Harrison, I realize with a bit of a shock. Harrison at the
	age of nine. </p>

	<p>I quickly start to skim through the old pictures. But I can't
	bring myself to totally skip over them, I can't look away. And
	then I meet with a photo of myself and dad. We're standing by the
	pool and dad has a huge smile on his face. I remember when it was
	taken. It's the last one she ever took of us.</p>

	<p>I'm all ready to throw away the whole stack, but luckily the next
	picture is of Sam. I sigh out in relief.</p>

	<p>"At least you're not drooling all over the camera
	anymore", she said when she came out and sat on the bed</p>

	<p>"Excuse me?", I frowned and grinned at the same time.</p>

	<p>And Sam smiled back so adorably.</p>

	<p>The memory of yesterday brings back my happy feelings. How good it
	felt just to spend time with Sam. To do something normal, and not
	fight. Plus then the added bonus of the extra... emotions. The tingly
	feeling I got all over. </p>

	<p>The last photo I took with the timer. It has me sitting on the edge
	of the bed, leaning my head on Sam's shoulder. She's sitting
	cross-legged in the middle of the bed and her eyes are slightly
	turned away from the camera. She's looking at me.</p>

	<p>It makes me smile again. Maybe I'll ask Sam if I can take more
	photos of her. Maybe I'll ask her right now. Or maybe we'll do
	something else. The future looks bright. All kinds of possibilities
	are floating around.</p>

	<p>"I've got a Niiiiikon camera!", I start humming while I
	ascend the stairs, "I Love to take a phooootograph!"</p>
