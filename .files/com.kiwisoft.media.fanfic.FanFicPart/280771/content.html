<!-- Human Layers \ Part One -->

<p>Walking out of the Bronze, Buffy was satisfied. Well, satisfied in one area,
at least. She had driven Angel crazy by dancing with Xander. She didn't know why
she did it exactly, but part of the reason was because vampires weren't exactly
her favorite things right now. It was funny how dying could really screw with
your mind. Especially when your death was at the hands of a vampire like the
Master. She couldn't get his ugly face out of her head.</p>
<p>When she was gone, she didn't see a light at the end of the tunnel, or feel a
comforting presence around her; it was dark, it was cold, and it was scary. And
she didn't want to let things get close enough to send her back there. Even
Angel.</p>
<p>She lost control whenever he was around. When he kissed her, when he was near
her...it was like magnetism, sexual and overwhelming. But when she was dancing
with Xander, she had shown Angel that she could do all that, too; that she could
be in control. She cared for Angel, even loved him in a way. He had saved her
life, and those feelings were bound to come up.</p>
<p>But she couldn't get lost in him, because then she'd fall hard without being
sure of anything, convince herself that he was the center of her world, and
never be over him. Love was a dangerous thing, and she didn't want loving
somebody to be dangerous. That kind was. Though she knew, despite her efforts
and probably her better judgment, things would happen contrary to her original
plan. It always worked out that way.</p>
<p>It wasn't time for any of this now, though, because she was confused, pissed
off, and incredibly stimulated. She knew she was going to regret that dance from
a friend standpoint later, but she was experiencing a whole different type of
regret at the moment.</p>
<p>"Buffy." Cordelia said from behind her. The slayer stopped walking.
This wasn't going to help. "You're really campaigning for 'Bitch of the
Year,' aren't you?"</p>

<p>Turning to the cheerleader, she had a smartass reply ready, regardless of her
other...'distractions.' "As defending champion, you nervous?"</p>
<p>"I can hold my own. You know, we've never really been close, which is
nice, cause I don't really like you that much, but...you have on occasion saved
the world and stuff, so I'm gonna...do you a favor."</p>
<p>It was amazing how quickly Cordelia could bore her. Though she did look good.
That was one thing the brunette could be repeatedly consistent with.</p>
<p>"And this great favor is...?"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna give you some advice. Get over it."</p>
<p>Sure, that made sense.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
<p>"Whatever's causing the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it. Embrace the
pain, spank your inner moppet, whatever, but get over it. Cause pretty soon
you're not even gonna have the loser friends you've got now."</p>

<p>Buffy stepped up to her, clearly displaying her anger. "I think it's
about time you start minding your own business."</p>
<p>"It's long past." Cordelia smiled.</p>
<p>What was this? A clique cease-fire or something? The Queen of All Things
Popular was expecting the Leader of the Freak Patrol to accept the white flag?
She couldn't believe it. Cordelia's timing was really, really bad, and she felt
like telling her to take her good advice and shove it up her...but, she did have
nice lips. Damn hormones. Lips that were nice and...</p>
<p>Kissable.</p>
<p>She stared at her, like she had done with Xander moments ago. Intensely.
Pulling off 'sexy' was easy, she was finding out. And it was making Cordelia
uncomfortable. She only wanted her to shut up, but this was great. Where did she
get the nerve to offer her a white flag after all she had done to them, anyway?
Especially now of all times? Talk about insensitive. She'd just have to put her
in her place.</p>
<p>Buffy ran her hand along Cordelia's cheek.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling okay?" The cheerleader stammered.</p>

<p>"Never better."</p>
<p>She kissed Cordelia Chase, and went all out for it, too. Long and hard,
possibly longer than she intended, but then broke it off. The sudden loss of
contact caused the brunette to let out a small, inaudible to the majority of
human beings who didn't have slayer hearing, whimper.</p>
<p>"Leave me alone."</p>
<p>She faced away from her, and started walking the other direction. Cordelia,
on the other hand, brought her hand to her lips, felt the smudged lipstick, and
tried to get her bearings.</p>
<p>"What the hell was that?"</p>
<p>"Consider it...returning the favor. A thank you for your advice."
Buffy flipped up the hood of her jacket, and kept going.</p>
<i>
<p>'Okay, that wasn't so bad. And it...made things worse.'</p>

</i>
<p>Before the frazzled cheerleader could yell any kind of response, a hand was
clamped over her mouth, and two vampires were dragging her across the alley into
a building.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>This was great. This was just perfect. The Anointed One and his group of
vampire cronies had unearthed the Master's bones and were going to bring him
back to unlife. As if she wasn't freaking out enough already. He would come
back, which was not fair and very, very wrong, and he would make sure the next
time he killed her, it would be a lot more permanent.</p>
<p>She needed to stop them. She needed to hit something. And sitting in the
library while everyone was being calm and researching this slowly and carefully,
made her want to scream. Her fear of the Master had taken over so much that she
was only partially aware that she was a step or two away from losing her
friends, and the only support base she had.</p>
<p>Cordelia was right. Cordelia. Buffy hadn't seen her since last night, and
that memory was not going away. But just like everything else lately, she didn't
know what to make of it, and preferred not to think about it. She did wonder
what was going through Cordelia's mind, however. Wait. She hadn't seen her since
last night. Hadn't she been in school?</p>
<p>She looked to the top of the stairs, as Xander started to say something.</p>
<p>"Well, is there anything on when the ceremony might take...?" A
rock came crashing through the window, and Buffy caught it easily from her spot
on the table. "Whoa!"</p>

<p>She saw a piece of paper on it, which was held in place by a nice-looking
bracelet.</p>
<p>"This is Cordelia's." She said, removing the jewelry and proceeding
to read. "'Come to the Bronze before it opens, or we make her a
meal.'"</p>
<i>
<p>'Damn it! They must've grabbed her right after I...damn it! I'm such a...I'm
gonna get her back.'</p>
</i>
<p>(<i>Why? </i>Her rational side wondered.<br>
<i>Cause we're friends. And it's my job. </i>Her bull...her less than truthful
side answered.<br>
<i>You're friends? When did this happen? I think you -</i>)</p>
<p>"They're gonna cook her dinner?" Xander asked in a worried tone,
halting the internal discussion. The gang stared at him. "I'll pretend I
didn't say that."</p>
<p>"What do we do?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>Buffy exhaled and hopped off the table. "I go to the Bronze and save the
day." She started for the doors.</p>

<p>"I don't like this." Xander told her.</p>
<p>"Nor I." Giles said, for once in agreement with the young man.</p>
<p>She turned around. "Yeah? Well, you guys aren't going."</p>
<p>(<i>You're not handling this right.</i> Her rational side argued, starting
again.<i><br>
It's for their own good. </i>Her not so rational side chipped in.<i><br>

Where do you get off making that decision?<br>
It's my mistake. I'll deal with it.</i>)</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Willow questioned, interrupting the debate this
time.</p>
<p>"I can't do it anymore. I can't look after the three of you guys while
I'm fighting."</p>
<p>(<i>Yeah, that's a *great* excuse. You're only pushing them away.</i>)</p>
<p>"Well, what about the rest of the note?"</p>

<p>"The rest of the note?"</p>
<p>"The part that says, 'P.S. This is a trap'?"</p>
<p>(<i>She's a smart one.<br>
Shut up!</i>)</p>
<p>"You'll be playing straight into their hands." Giles said, removing
his glasses.</p>
<p>"I can handle this." Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Stop saying that! God, what's wrong with you?" Willow asked,
nearly yelling.</p>
<p>"Cordelia may be dead." Xander said, flat out.</p>
<p>"She's *not* dead. Don't say that. She'll be fine." She paused.
"This is my fight."</p>
<p>Grabbing her coat off the counter, Buffy hurried out of the library.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>

<p>"It's entirely pointy. I was a moron. I put my best friends in mortal
danger on the second day of school." Buffy was telling her watcher the next
morning as they walked through the quad.</p>
<p>She had indeed saved the day; everyone was rescued. And there was that part
where she smashed the Master's bones with a sledgehammer, thereby getting
closure and allowing her to release a summer's worth of pent up emotion, crying
into Angel's chest, while everyone looked on. It was quite the spectacle. This
thing with Angel wasn't going away.</p>
<p>"What are you gonna do? Crawl inside a cave for the rest of your
life?" Giles asked her.</p>
<p>"Would it have cable?" She asked in a small voice.</p>
<p>He smiled at her. "Buffy, you acted wrongly; I admit that. But believe
me, that was hardly the-the worst mistake you'll ever make." He had to
think about that. "Uh, that wasn't quite as comforting as it was meant to
be."</p>

<p>"Well, points for effort." She gave him a tiny smile as the bell
rang. "See ya."</p>
<p>Then she saw Cordelia walking with Miss Calendar. The thing with her wasn't
going away, either. She had to say something. After the cleansing, the guilt and
realization of what she'd done to everybody hit her, and she felt terrible. She
had been a royal bitch, and Cordelia was at the top of her list of guilt. They
hadn't spoken, but they were going to now.</p>
<p>Buffy ran up to them. "Hi, Miss Calendar. Um, I need to talk to Cordelia."</p>
<p>She grabbed the cheerleader by the arm and dragged her over to a quiet corner
of the quad. It wasn't the most polite way to go about it, but it was the only
way she'd ever get her attention.</p>
<p>"Hey! Enough with the manhandling." Cordelia wrenched her arm free.
"I'm gonna be late for class."</p>

<p>"Since when did you start caring about being punctual?"</p>
<p>"Since about ten seconds ago." She tried to leave.</p>
<p>"Wait. Please." She stopped. "I just wanted to say that,
I'm...sorry. For *everything*."</p>
<p>"Keep your voice down!" Cordelia snapped. Buffy raised her
eyebrows. "I'm trying to block it out, so could you please not mention it?
Ever?"</p>
<p>"I don't normally...I'm not usually like that. I wasn't thinking
straight and I was -"</p>

<p>"Horny?" Buffy flushed. "I guess if I was a slayer, and I was
killed by an ancient vampire, and I was brought back to life only to find out
that he was going to come back to do it all over again...I'd be a crazed, pain
in the ass, too."</p>
<p>"It's always about you, isn't it?" Buffy smirked.</p>
<p>"Of course." Buffy began to open her mouth. "Don't. You're
forgiven, okay? Let's just show a little maturity...and move past this. As long
as we have a mutual understanding, I don't see any reason why -"</p>
<p>"You didn't like it?" The slayer's confidence level was dropping.</p>

<p>Cordelia had to think this over. Lie or be honest? She was usually good at
lying, but Buffy could read people. She was trained to. At least Cordelia
thought she was. There was no other option; honesty it was, then.</p>
<p>"No, I did. That's why I'm trying to forget it." Buffy smiled.
"So you're done being 'Miss Sexual Predator' and you're sorry. Got it.
Going now."</p>
<p>The cheerleader started to head inside.</p>
<p>"Cordy?"</p>
<p>"What?" The brunette sighed, turning around.</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>Cordelia didn't want to smile at her, but did anyway, and continued walking.</p>
<p>(<i>That kiss wasn't the only thing you liked. You like the whole -</i></p>
<p><i>Shut up.</i>)</p>
<p>It was going to be a long year.</p>
