<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Twenty-Two -->

<p>After dragging herself out of bed, Lacy made an early morning call to David's partner, Ryan White, asking him to confirm the information Mark Calico supplied Gage the previous day. </p>
		<p>When Lacy noted a raised eyebrow from Gage, she explained. "It's not that I don't believe Mark. I need to be sure of the facts before I go accusing David of anything. I can't take chances where my kids are concerned."</p>
		<p>Cocking her head sideways and displaying a lopsided smile, Gage took her lover into a warm embrace. "Then we won't."</p>
		<p>"I want to hang around here in case he calls back today." Lacy said, returning the hug fiercely. "Thank you." </p>
		<p>Totally lost in the moment, sharing tender kisses, they didn't notice a mischievous three-year-old sneak up on them until he tugged at his mother's leg. "Momma." Derek reached up. "Want hug, too."</p>
		<p>Lacy dipped down, retrieving her son, sandwiching him between the two lovers. "That better?"</p>
		<p>"Unn hunnn." Wiggling between them, securing his place amongst two of the three most important people in his young life, Derek giggled when he saw the perplexing look his sister wore as he peeked over his mother's shoulder. "Dani." He pointed then quickly hid his head, burying it between his mother and Gage.</p>
		<p>With her back to her daughter, Lacy chilled to the bone, allowed every imaginable thought run through her mind of what Dani must be thinking. Lacy slowly turned around to face an expected accusation, meeting an annoyed expression instead. </p>
		<p>"Derek!" Dani cocked her hands on her hips. She pointed back at her brother. "That is my whistle." She sauntered up to her mother and Gage. Reaching up she reclaimed it. "Thanks for trying to get it from him." Dani walked off ignorant of the shared lover's embrace. "We going swimming today?"</p>
		<p>The breath she held escaped slowing, relieving the mounting tension Lacy had felt rise. "No. I'm expecting a call."</p>
		<p>As if on cue the telephone rang, Lacy bolted for it. "Hello." A pregnant pause. "Oh, hi, mom." She sat down on the edge of the couch. "No, I was expecting someone else. What's up?"</p>
		<p>"You still coming to visit us after you're vacation?" Lynn asked avoiding what was really on her mind.</p>
		<p>Lacy threw a quick look to Gage before she answered. "Yes. Yes, we will."</p>
		<p>Hesitant, Lynn continued. "I take it that David won't be coming along."</p>
		<p>Silence reigned between them as Lacy processed the implication of her mother's words. "David called you, didn't he?" Connecting with concerned green eyes, Lacy gave Gage the only cue she needed. Gage gathered the kids up, herding them out the door on their way to the boathouse.</p>
		<p>"Yes." </p>
		<p>This simple reply left no doubt about what her mother was thinking. "What did he tell you? No, I have a fair idea." Summoning her courage,
			<i>This isn't the way I wanted my parents to find out. </i> Lacy said. "He told you about the divorce, I take it."
		</p>
		<p>"To be honest, honey, I'm more concerned about....." Lynn started to say.</p>
		<p>"You don't sound surprised about the divorce." Delaying the inevitable discussion between mother and daughter regarding Gage.</p>
		<p>"Not really. I've seen it coming for a long time." Lynn decided not to beat around the bush. "What I didn't see coming was David's claim...." She emphasized that last word, not really believing it. "That you were cheating on him."</p>
		<p>"What!" Lacy was livid, jumping off the couch only to pace around the room. "He cheated on me."</p>
		<p>"With your co-star?" Lynn asked.</p>
		<p>"Did you see that too?" The question held a biting sarcastic edge. </p>
		<p>"Lacy Francine. I am still your mother." Lynn admonished her actor daughter. </p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. My emotions have been on a roller coaster ride this last week." Lacy admitted. </p>
		<p>"I'm sure they have. Now, tell me about this friend of yours." Her voice offered no judgment.</p>
		<p>"Her name is Gage. She's a writer and she saved both of your grandchildren's lives." Lacy offered hopefully in a symbolic gesture to put Gage's best foot forward before she realized the impact her words had.</p>
		<p>Drawing in a deep breath, Lynn asked quietly. "They're okay?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. Absolutely perfect. Really." </p>
		<p>"Then we'll put that aside for now, but I will want every detail nothing left out. Understand? Now tell me about Gage." </p>
		<p>Mother and daughter talked for the next hour. Lacy relating the highs and lows their vacation served up only leaving out the most intimate details of her relationship with the writer. Although her astute mother ploughed through Lacy's evasive explanation, zeroing in on the concealed information her daughter refused to supply. </p>
		<p>"Lacy, I just want you to know you can tell me anything. I am your mother and I love you. Your father and I both do.... no matter what."</p>
		<p>
			<i>No matter what? I'm gonna hold you to that mom. </i>"I know and I love you too." Lacy suggested a compromise. "How bout we talk when we come to visit?"
		</p>
		<p>"Will I meet Gage?" Like a bulldog reluctant to let go of the bone, Lynn held firm.</p>
		<p>"Yes." With that the conversation ended.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Early afternoon brought the call Lacy was expecting. "Ryan, thank you." She hung up the telephone. All her suspicions confirmed. Walking outside, she met up with the happy trio fishing from the dock. Lacy took a seat next to Gage. </p>
		<p>"Mom, look." Dani shoved the cooler full of fish at her mother. "Guess what's for dinner."</p>
		<p>Unexpectedly, Lacy pulled her daughter into a hug, squeezing her tightly, which practically knocked the cooler from the young girl's hands.</p>
		<p>"Hey." Dani complained.</p>
		<p>"Sorry." She watched Dani move back to her original fishing position on the edge of the dock. </p>
		<p>Covertly, the expert fishermen watched her mother's sad expression turn even gloomier.
			<i>I bet it's because of dad. Why does he have to work all the time? And I won't even think about the broken promises. </i>Determined to bring a smile back to her mother's face, Dani vowed to be the very best daughter she could. Suddenly, she rose, walked over to her mother and kissed her. "I love you."
		</p>
		<p>Welcoming the unexpected gesture, Lacy kissed her daughter's cheek. "What's this all about?"</p>
		<p>Having watched Dani, Derek wanted in on the action. He almost missed the early morning hug between his mother and Gage and would not be left out of this either. Derek carelessly tossed his fishing pole in the water, climbing up on his mother's lap; he gave her a sloppy wet kiss.</p>
		<p>Astonished by her brother actions, Dani yelled out, pointing to the murky water below. "The pole. Get the pole!"</p>
		<p>If Gage would have taken the time to think, she would have realized ?
			<i>it's just a fishing pole and we can get others' </i>but, no, spurred on by Dani's hysterical screaming, Gage dove in.
		</p>
		<p>A short while later Gage surfaced to find three concerned faces looming over the dock's edge. Holding up the pole, the writer lifted herself up out of the water. Soaked, she sat on the dock, handing the discarded pole to Dani. </p>
		<p>Taking it, she perused it carefully. "Oh, this is his old one. It was kinda broke." Giving it back to Gage, Dani casually said over her shoulder. "Thanks anyway."</p>
		<p>A frustrated glance found its way from daughter to mother then to a happy three year old who decided Gage needed a kiss, too. The fact that it was a sloppy wet one just like the one he gave his mother didn't have as much impact on the writer as trickles of water fell from her hair, sliding down her face. "You're welcome."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>A warm shower later along with dry clothes altered Gage's mood considerable. As the kids watched some videos Lacy had brought with them, the star recounted to Gage her earlier conversation with Ryan White.</p>
		<p>"It's all true. Ryan was a bit shocked that David went behind his back. My next movie is with Griffen Studios."</p>
		<p>"And that Casanova chap Koda Kannon."
			<i>I won't be jealous. I won't be jealous.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy covered the writer's hand, squeezing it. As the kids were enthralled in the Derek's favorite cartoon, Lacy took the opportunity to steal a quick kiss from her lover. "Griffen is financing it. And David and Ryan are....were the producers. Ryan was also scheduled to direct it."</p>
		<p>"And now?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know what's going to happen now. Anyway, when David killed off my character he secretly planned with Griffen to do a TV movie of the show then do a spin off. They didn't want to just let it go since it was such a big success. Griffen tied me into doing a movie to make up for quitting. Now, as Mark found out and Ryan confirms, David went to MegaCom behind everyone's back in an effort to get more control of the show's spin off, sweetening the deal with the movie Koda and I are scheduled to do."</p>
		<p>"How can he wheel and deal like that? Who holds the rights to the show anyway?" The business end of show business was foreign to Gage.</p>
		<p>"David was setting it up. Then MegaCom would have initiated the deal with Griffen, buying out the rights to the show and David would have pulled out from Griffen Studios on my next movie tossing it to MegaCom. You see, Hayston hadn't signed on for the spin off yet. With David controlling her, he potentially had Griffen over the barrel."</p>
		<p>"And Ryan was left out of the loop?"</p>
		<p>"Ryan would never have gone along with it." Lacy stated with absolute assuredness. "He's very loyal. Where it leaves the two of them now, David and Ryan, who knows? I suspect Ryan will insist David holds to their original deal with Griffen about the movie and sort out the rest later. Though, hopefully, David will take a back seat in making it."</p>
		<p>"Ryan sounds like a great guy." Gage said.</p>
		<p>"He is. As a matter of fact, he found out from David that Sally called him about us......kissing. Ned, Ralph or Buddy must have saw us and told Sally."</p>
		<p>"Jage..... it's Jage." Derek yelled, pointing to the TV screen. </p>
		<p>Rushing into the living room, Lacy and Gage watched Derek bounce on the floor, happily pointing to the cartoon character that looked amazingly like Gage.</p>
		<p>"That's it." Dani jumped up. "That's why he threw himself at you. Yes." Dani jacked her arm in victory. </p>
		<p>"Dani, what do you mean?" Lacy inquired of her overexcited daughter.</p>
		<p>"You see, I couldn't figure out why Derek liked her so much." Shifting a quick glimpse to the writer. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>Waving a dismissive hand. "No problem." </p>
		<p>Dani continued. "Derek thinks he's Devlin. There." The eight year old pointed to the cartoon's main character. </p>
		<p>"Debin. Debin, Debin." Derek chanted.</p>
		<p>When the character that looked like Gage reappeared, Dani explained further. "This character, Gentry, is Devlin's hero. Kinda a protector." </p>
		<p>"Genty. Jage." Derek said, pushing up from his seat on the floor then grabbing Gage's hand, pulling her closer to the TV set.</p>
		<p>Rubbing her chin in deep thought, Dani remembered. "There was a show once where Devlin had to jump off this cliff and Gentry caught him. That's it. That's why he jumped to her. Case closed." She concluded.</p>
		<p>The mystery finally solved, the four sat down on the floor as Derek climbed on the lap of his favorite hero content to watch Gage's hero counterpart on TV.</p>
