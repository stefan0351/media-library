<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 22 -->

<p>Karen took a deep cleansing breath as she came
to a stop in front of the door then reached out and slowly tugged the door open, smiling
widely though she only really felt like smiling semi-widely. The first thing she saw was
Jessie's equally smiling face and then a blur of movement as her daughter stepped
towards her drawing her into a hug and kissing her on the cheek before entering the house.
Then once Jessie had moved out of the way, Karen too stepped back opening the door a bit
wider so that Katie could step in.</p>

<p>On the porch the other girl had been covered
in darkness and Karen hadn't been able to recognize her, but once she had stepped
inside and looked up awkwardly offering Karen a bottle of wine a swell of memories
returned to her.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Karen said taking the
proffered bottle into her hands. "The years have been generous," she continued
looking at Katie and barely able to separate the woman standing in front of her from the
child that used to practically live at her house.</p>

<p>"I," Katie said smiling, "was
just thinking exactly the same thing," she continued stepping towards Karen
hesitantly. "It's nice to see you again Mrs. Higgins," she went on the
words coming out slightly strange as she tried to settle herself to Karen's new
moniker.</p>

<p>Karen too then took a step forward allowing
Katie to hug her lightly. The truth was that she had always liked Katie a great deal, not
simply because of the happiness she had brought Jessie, but because she was a genuinely
likeable young woman, smart, funny, caring and obliviously charming. And once, the initial
trepidation in regards to Jessie and Katie's relationship had worn off, Karen had
formed a new and more vivid portrait of Jessie's future in her mind, one that had
involved Katie, and even though she knew it had been too romantic, to idealistic she
hadn't been able to deny the poignancy of their relationship, even though it was
perhaps the realistic thing to do. They had helped her to believe in love again, and when
they had broken up she had taken it almost as hard as Jessie. So, she wasn't quite
yet able to say that it was nice to see Katie again, but she could acknowledge that she
had missed the girl.</p>

<p>"Karen," Karen said a moment later
when she and Katie pulled apart. "We are both adults now after all," she
continued placing her hand on Katie's shoulder before turning to look down the
hallway. "Don't you have a giant magic eight-ball to read?" Karen asked
looking over at Jessie who had simply been watching them since entering the house.</p>

<p>"He gets agitated and makes the frown-y
face when I do that," Jessie responded pouting a little as she looked longing down
towards the end of the hallway where she could just make out Henry's figure puttering
towards them. "He says it's not cute anymore," she went on thinking about
how much fun it'd been to harass him when he and Karen were still dating. Whenever he
sat down she'd walk up behind him and Eli would ask a question then she'd blow
on top of his head and read an imaginary message like 'Looks Doubtful', and
Karen would shake her head and tell them to sit down, while Henry would mutter
'cute' even though he obviously didn't think it was.</p>

<p>"You didn't?" Katie said
looking over at Jessie as Karen took their coats. "You did," she said smiling
when Jessie merely shrugged.</p>

<p>"At the time I had recently come under a
corrupting influence," Jessie said by way of defense looking pointedly at Katie
before feeling Henry hug her from behind and kiss the top of her head. "Tell her
it's all her fault Shmoopy," Jessie continued smiling back at Henry.</p>

<p>"It's all your fault," Henry
said looking over at Katie. He recognized her, having been over at Karen's at the
same time as Katie over the summers and vacation breaks, but he hadn't been able to
spend as much time with her back then as everyone else had. However, what he had seen
he'd liked, at least until he saw how the breakup had affected his two favorite
women. "What's your fault?" he continued stepping away from Jessie and
offering his hand to Katie.</p>

<p>"Her delinquent tendencies," Katie
responded shaking his hand. "Although I maintain I was simply the catalyst not the
creator," she continued earning fond glare from Jessie.</p>

<p>"I think," Karen said, taking a deep
breath and preparing herself to let bygones be bygones. "This is when I should say,
'dinner is served'."</p>

<p>"Saved by my mother," Jessie
responded smiling at Karen having seen her defensive posture loosen slightly.</p>

<p>"Wasn't Tori Spelling in that?"
Katie asked looking over at Jessie as the blonde took her hand. "A tale of a skanky
co-ed and a date that went horrible, horribly wrong that becomes a moving story of triumph
over evil and love when the mother breaks down the door with an axe."</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea what she's
talking about?" Henry whispered in Jessie's ear as they headed to the living.</p>

<p>"Not usually, no," Jessie responded
winking at him.</p>
