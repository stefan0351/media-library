<P>Guess I'll make it a two-shot. Enjoy! Oh and <I>Miley thinking, </I><I><B>Lilly thinking</B></I></P><P>"What ever happened to 'I'll be quick'?" The agitated blonde asked after over an hour of waiting.</P><P>"Sorry, but my hair just isn't listening to me. I can't leave looking like this. Maybe if I just had a little help." Miley hollered from the bathroom as the other girl fed the plastic child.</P><P>"Sorry, a good mother would never leave her child unattended." Miley poked her head out of the door giving Lilly a look before closing it again. With a sigh, "Fine. Hold on."</P><P>She gently placed the doll in it's carrier adjusting it's hands to where it could hold the bottle to it's lips on it's own. Opening the door, Lilly felt her breath hitch in her throat.</P><P>"Oh, good. Come help me pick out something to wear." She demanded grabbing Lilly's hand and pulling her into the Hannah closet with her; Lilly's eyes following her every movement. It wasn't like this was the first time Lilly saw her friend in only a towel, but that was before Miley began filling out in all the right places.</P><P>"No… no… no way… so last year." Miley mumbled as clothes flew to the floor. "Lilly, are you just gonna stand there?" Her words snapping Lilly back to reality. "Ugh, I can't find a thing to wear."</P><P>After 10 minutes of looking, Lilly mostly at Miley, the entire area around them was piled with unworthy clothes. Just as Lilly was about to leave Miley to her own biddings, a simple, yet cute shirt caught her eye: short sleeved, tight, black, and out of Lilly's reach.</P><P>Lilly stretched on her tiptoes as high as she could trying to grab the shirt without having to pull on it. Failing miserably, the shorter girl walked out and returned with a chair, placing it under the high rack.</P><P>Shifting through clothes feeling apathetic at this point, Miley noticed the awkward girl standing on the chair. With a slight laugh, "Lilly, what are you doing?"</P><P>Coming back down to ground level, "Trying to reach this shirt." She said pointing to the tight, black shirt.</P><P>Miley's eyes widened as she saw the shirt hanging close to the ceiling. "Omigosh, Lilly that's perfect." The taller girl squealed as she pulled Lilly into a lung-crushing hug. "Here, let me try." Luckily, Miley was just tall enough to reach it. Handing Lilly the shirt, "Oh, I can't wait to see the look on Amber's face when she sees me lookin' fine as hell tonight."</P><P>Biting her lip, <I>Jake won't be able to keep his paws off me</I>. "Help me down."</P><P>Putting her hands on Lilly's shoulders, Miley jumped off the chair only to land with nothing to cover her now naked self.</P><P>Instantly, Lilly's face became 5 shades of red. "What's with the blush, Truscott?" She opened her mouth to speak but her words caught in her throat. Lilly's eyes explored the nude figure standing in front of her; her mouth watering more with every curve her eyes ran over. Her mind was screaming at her to look up, look away, look anywhere but there. But she couldn't.</P><P>Following the path of her friend's eyes, Miley looked down to see no towel, just her naked self. She instinctively covered herself and screamed breaking Lilly out of her daze.</P><P>"What the hell, Lilly? You could have at least told me!" Miley screamed looking around for her towel.</P><P>Ripping it off the rack, which it was caught on, Lilly handed Miley her towel and quickly walked out of the closet.</P><P>After putting on a bra and matching pair of laced underwear, Miley sauntered to the door trying to see if Lilly was still anywhere in the room. She was sure that Lilly was gone because the baby had been crying for the last minute.</P><P>She had begun walking to the baby, but froze when she heard Lilly's voice.</P><P>"Stupid, stupid, stupid. Dammit, Lilly. How perverted can you be? She's your best friend. She sees you as nothing more and you know that. Even if she is the one thing you want most in this world. Now she hate probably hates you." The last sentence was what really pulled at Miley's heartstrings, sending tears to sting her eyes.</P><P>"I don't hate you Lilly." The sound of Miley's voice made Lilly heart ache with terror. "Lilly, I-I'm sorry I freaked out like that. I didn't mean to."</P><P>Feeling like a child caught stealing candy, Lilly didn't know what to say. "What do you want me to say, Miley? You want me to apologize?" Lilly asked getting up and turning to Miley, her mouth slightly dropping at the sight of Miley in only a bra and panties.</P><P>More frustrated with herself more than anything, Lilly pulled her eyes back to Miley's. "Well, I'm sorry, okay?" Lilly yelled throwing her hands aimlessly in the air.</P><P>"You don't have to be sorry, Lilly. It's not like you meant for it to happen; it just did."</P><P>Annoyed with herself, with her lack of courage, Lilly' anger spilled over her wall; filling her eyes with water. "But I did, Miley! I wanted that towel to fall straight to the floor the second I saw you in it. So, yes, I do have to apologize."</P><P>A slight fear ran over Miley as all traces of the cowardice, shy girl she's known for years was gone. So many questions and feelings were going through her, but she just kept quiet.</P><P>As hard as she fought the tears, it wasn't enough. "Forgive me, Miley. Forgive me for wanting you, forgive me for thinking you're absolutely beautiful, forgive me for everything! But the one thing I won't apologize for is falling in love with you. And I'm sorry if I've ruined your big night with Jake, but I just couldn't fake it anymore." A flood of tears was now running down her cheeks.</P><P><I>She loves me?</I> Miley heart began beating heavily against her chest at Lilly's words. Slowly walking towards the crying girl, Miley wrapped her arms around Lilly. Holding her tight, she leaned down and kissed Lilly's cheek, stopping the blonde's sobs.</P><P>"Lilly, look at me." The blonde timidly lifted her head, meeting green eyes with blue. "I don't care about Jake, I only care about you. I don't like seeing the girl I love cry."</P><P>Lilly's eyes widened, "You love me?" Miley smiled and nodded. "But, I thought you liked Jake?" She asked confusingly.</P><P>"Well, I never really liked him; I was trying to make you jealous." She said timidly. "But, I think it worked." She gazed at the shocked blonde before leaning down and locking their lips.</P><P>Several moments passed before they released each other for air. "So, does this mean you're not going to the party?" Lilly asked shyly.</P><P>"It wouldn't be any fun without you there." A smile appeared on Lilly's face as she took a step back to observe the brunette in front of her.</P><P>"How about we have a little party of our own." She wiggled her eyebrows gaining a laugh from the other girl.</P><P>"Sounds like a plan." Miley leaned in but was surprised when her lips made contact with a cheek. She was confused until she heard the sound of the baby crying. "Just leave it." She said as she grabbed the blonde and kissed her.</P><P>"Can't" Lilly said breaking the kiss.</P><P>"Even now, that damn thing still finds a way to ruin my plans." Miley said under her breath watching the girl she loved care for a fictional child. "But, I guess without it, none of this would have happened."</P><P>Hmm, I am not very pleased with the way this ended but tell me what you think anyways. Thanks for reading!</P>
