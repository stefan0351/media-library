<p><b>Chapter 5</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lilly stretched out on her towel, trying to get as much sun as possible. Tall, thick trees surrounded the creek and thus the amount of sunlight filtering through was minimal. Yelling and splashing could be heard in the distance and she sighed. She hadn't really wanted to come, though she really enjoyed the outdoors and the cool water. But Lilly had spent the past few days thinking almost non-stop about Miley and that kiss on the cheek. She'd paced for a good hour, warring with herself over calling, and had finally given in and dialed the girl's super-secret number. The conversation hadn't gone as expected and she frowned, thinking back to this morning.</p>
<p>"Uh, hi, is Miley there?" asked Lilly, even more nervous now that someone other than Miley had answered.</p>
<p>"Who is this?" asked the woman on the other end, sounding skeptical and worried. Her voice sounded too old to be Miley's mom and Lilly figured it was her grandma.</p>
<p>"I'm Lilly, Miley's friend." She hoped Miley had mentioned her and this wouldn't continue being this awkward. But the woman on the other end was silent. Lilly's nervousness increased, "Miley gave me this number, she said it'd be okay for me to call. I wasn't trying to get her in trouble or anything…I just wanted to see if she'd like to hang out."</p>
<p>"Look," the woman's voice didn't sound quite as hostile as before, "it's probably best you don't call here again. Miley's grounded; she's not allowed to go outside."</p>
<p>Before she'd had a chance to say or ask anything else, the woman had hung up. Lilly had wondered for the thousandth time what in the world was going on. She had almost figured Miley would still be grounded; she knew if she snuck out while being grounded, she'd probably never leave the house again. But Lilly couldn't understand why the girl's family was acting so strange.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lilly, come on, we need one more person to play chicken," yelled Oliver, pulling her out of her stupor.</p>
<p>She almost said 'no', but the pleading look in his eyes made her reconsider. Did people honestly still play chicken? In Malibu, they'd spent their time in the water on surfboards or boogie boards or at the very least throwing around a football. She followed him into the water, where some other people were obviously waiting for them. The water was cool and clear and felt excellent against her heated skin. Lilly climbed on the shoulders of some boy she didn't know and they were soon embroiled in all out war.</p>
<p>Lilly was much stronger than most her opponents and easily knocked them into the water. She was admittedly having some fun, but after a straight twenty minutes of shoving shrieking girls into the water, she'd had enough. She let Sarah land a hit to her shoulder and went with the blow to land in the water. She hadn't even realized she'd dried off completely until the water enveloped her. Lilly floated on her back, staring up at the tree branches and the sunlight filtering through. It truly was a beautiful place and she just wished she could share it with the one person she actually wanted to.</p>
<p>Her eyes strafed the tall rock wall off to the other side. Something caught her eye and she stood upright in the water, looking up at the cliff. She could have sworn she saw a figure up on the cliff, but it was gone. Excitement bubbled inside of her and she swiftly climbed out of the creek, yelling at her friends that she'd be right back. They hardly noticed her and Lilly grabbed her towel and shirt off the ground, slipping her feet into her sneakers hastily. She'd worn her board shorts today and she was grateful; it would be a little uncomfortable traipsing about the woods in practically nothing.</p>
<p>She had no idea how to get up to the cliff from this side and walked along the creek until the hill seemed to level off somewhat. Lilly quickly crossed the creek, jumping on some stones, though her sneakers got wet regardless. She scrambled up the incline and walked back to where she'd come from, the hill increasing in height with each step. The trees and brush were getting thicker and soon she had to practically fight her way through. She had no idea where she was and all too suddenly she broke through onto the plateau she'd been at with Miley. Lilly squeaked when she saw how close to the edge of the cliff she was. She heard laughter.</p>
<p>"And here I thought it was a drunken raccoon coming to get me."</p>
<p>Lilly looked up and smiled when she saw Miley. The girl was standing on the other side of the cliff and though she appeared casual now, Lilly could tell she'd been worried. For one, there was a knife in her hand. She flipped it shut and grinned. Lilly felt slightly out of breath, partially from her mad dash up the hill and partially from seeing Miley.</p>
<p>"I thought I saw you up here. Aren't you grounded?" She hadn't meant to sound so accusatory, but she briefly wondered if Miley had asked her grandma to lie about being grounded so she wouldn't have to hang out.</p>
<p>Miley grinned again. "I am. Grandma is taking a nap and I escaped."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head at the girl, but smiled nonetheless. Miley seemed to not care about anything and she was so quirky and spontaneous, it drew Lilly even further in. She spread her towel on the ground and sat, patting the spot beside her. Miley didn't hesitate, sitting right beside her though there was plenty of space.</p>
<p>"So, is that your boyfriend?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked at Miley, confused. Hadn't they been flirting for a few weeks now? Maybe that kiss on the cheek <b>had</b> been totally innocent. "Who?"</p>
<p>"That guy who had his head between your legs," said Miley simply and Lilly nearly choked. Miley laughed at her obvious discomfort and Lilly boxed her in the side.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I'm not exactly in the market for a boyfriend. I'm gay."</p>
<p>Lilly tried to gauge Miley's reaction, but other than a few times where she'd seemed sad, she never wore a look other than one of mirth and mischief. Miley grinned at her, "Not a lot of gay people in this town."</p>
<p>"That's what I figured," said Lilly, waiting for Miley to make some kind of comment about this. Even people that were okay with her sexual orientation normally had to say <b>something</b> about it, even if it was just to let her know how tolerant they were. Miley hadn't even batted an eye, nor had she given any indication to her own preferences.</p>
<p>Lilly figured she'd have to dig. "So, what about you? Any boyfriends?"</p>
<p>Miley's smile faltered slightly and she looked down at the ground. "I'm not exactly…girlfriend material."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what that meant exactly, but judging by how everyone talked about the girl, she had an idea. "So, you've never been on a date before?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, still looking down. She'd flipped open her knife again and was drawing the tip through the dirt at her feet. "Once…didn't work out."</p>
<p>The girl sounded so calm and resolved about everything, Lilly didn't know what to say. Silence fell over them, though it was in no way uncomfortable. Lilly wasn't sure she <b>could</b> be uncomfortable around Miley. She watched the girl flip the blade shut, before opening it again with a flick of her wrist. She repeated the action multiple times, before she spoke again.</p>
<p>"This was my daddy's knife. He said I'd put it to much better use than him when he gave it to me." Miley's voice was soft, but not as sad as Lilly might have expected.</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed. "I heard your dad died, is that true?"</p>
<p>Miley stopped her movements and finally met Lilly's eyes again. She nodded. "Yeah, my daddy and my older brother died in a car crash a little over a year ago."</p>
<p>Lilly felt a horrible sadness wash over her at the girl's words; she couldn't imagine losing both her father and brother and then being this okay, this happy after. She knew Miley was an incredible person and wanted nothing more than to get to know her better. "Wow, I'm sorry…that must have been rough."</p>
<p>"It was. We were all really close," said Miley, but then smiled as if those bad memories hardly affected her, "but I still got my mom and my grandma and they love me a ton."</p>
<p>They sat, watching the sun move across the horizon and Lilly wondered whether Oliver and Sarah had noticed she was gone. She certainly didn't want to leave Miley to return to them. She sighed and stretched out her legs, resting her weight on her arms behind her. She'd thrown her t-shirt back on, but both it and her board shorts were still wet and it felt nice in the afternoon heat. A warm breeze brushed across her and Lilly sighed contently, lying back onto the ground. She stretched her arms out wide and closed her eyes, enjoying the fresh air and most of all, the company.</p>
<p>Lilly almost jumped when she felt the warm body pressing against her side and the head come to rest just below her breasts. She swallowed hard, opening her eyes and lifting her head. Miley was curled up next to her, her head bedded on Lilly's stomach as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Lilly had no idea what she was supposed to do, or say, and her heart merely thundered in her chest. Her hand itched to touch Miley's head where it lay, but she wasn't sure if it would be okay. Of course, Lilly reasoned, Miley had just plopped down practically on top of her without ever asking if she minded.</p>
<p>Lilly brought up her left arm and tentatively ran a hand up the girl's back. Miley was incredibly warm and her heat radiated to Lilly. She brushed her fingertips lightly across Miley's exposed neck and the girl laughed. It sent vibrations straight through Lilly's body, from her head down to her toes, and everything between. She suddenly realized Miley's proximity to some very sensitive regions. Miley's hand played with the tie of Lilly's board shorts and she had to suppress a groan. What was that girl trying to do to her?</p>
<p>Miley laughed again, cheek pressed tightly against Lilly's abdomen, "You're all wet." Lilly closed her eyes and let her head fall back, not even able to suppress the groan that time. You have no idea, she thought.</p>
