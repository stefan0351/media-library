<!-- The Truth about Tippy Typewriter \ Part Two -->

<p>Sam couldn't figure out why Brooke had been looking at her all day.
			Even now as she tried to listen to "The Claw" and take physics notes,
			she could feel the hazel eyes burning a hole in her face. She waited
			until Ms. Glass' attention was turned back towards the board before
			looking over at the blonde in confusion. Brooke just sent her an odd
			smile before turning back to the front. Sam shrugged and continued
			writing.</p>
		<p>The bell rang shortly after that and Sam stood grabbing her bag and
			books. She was heading out of the room towards her locker, when she
			heard Brooke calling her name from behind her. Brooke caught up to her
			as she entered the combination on her lock.</p>
		<p>"Hey are you headed to lunch?" Brooke asked a little winded.</p>
		<p>"Of course, where else would I be going?" Sam asked a little
			suspicious. Something was going on with the cheerleader.</p>
		<p>"Oh, well I didn't know if you had to go to the newspaper office or
			something."</p>
		<p>"Nope, just heading to the cafeteria." Sam replied closing her locker.
			"You coming?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, yeah of course." Brooke answered walking along side the brunette.</p>
		<p>They walked into the cafeteria and got in line followed by Josh and
			Lily. Sam took the proffered sloppy joe, ignoring Lily's look of
			disgust. "If it's any consolation, Lily, I'm pretty sure there's no
			meat in this whatsoever." She said before walking over to their lunch
			table.</p>
		<p>They all now sat at the "Popular" table, having long ago squashed the
			stupid rift that existed between the groups. She knew that was due, in
			large part, to her and Brooke becoming best friends. Sam was forever
			grateful to whatever force had landed them in this place at this time.
			Brooke had proven to be a great friend. Her home life had never been
			better. Her mother and Mike were planning another wedding, and Mac was
			growing up nicely. She was even making slow progress repairing her
			friendship with George. She was just happy she hadn't lost Harrison
			after the whole fiasco last year.</p>
		<p>She sat down in between Brooke and Carmen. The two immediately began
			talking about cheerleading. Sam wasn't really interested in anything
			they had to say, so she spaced, allowing the sweet lilt of Brooke's
			voice to lull her while she ate. She leaned over a little trying to
			catch the scent of Brooke's perfume and shampoo. Spending time as much
			time with Brooke as she now did, afforded her a lot of opportunities,
			benefits that fed and often fueled her little crush. She had finally
			admitted to herself, months ago, that her feelings for Brooke would
			never be sisterly. They were far from anything remotely close to
			sisterly affection.</p>
		<p>Sam would never disrespect her newfound friendship with the blonde,
			but that didn't mean that she didn't take advantage of when the
			opportunity presented itself. She now knew how to get Brooke to smile
			or laugh a certain way, or what cheered her up when she was having a
			bad day. Sam especially liked the last part because it usually ended
			with her receiving a hug for her troubles, and Sam would do just about
			anything to receive one of those warm embraces. The memories had kept
			her company on many a lonely night.</p>
		<p>"Hey ya'll" Mary Cherry said as she and Harrison sat at the table.</p>
		<p>A chorus of 'hey' rang up from the table. Harrison became engrossed
			in the conversation Josh and Sugar were having while Mary Cherry
			joined into the riveting conversation Brooke and Carmen were having
			about routines, leaving Sam to listen to Lily's latest crusade. She
			felt Brooke shift next to her and their thighs brushed against each
			other. She fought hard to bite back the gasp, hoping no one would
			notice. She saw Harrison shoot her an odd look, but smiled back,
			pretending nothing was wrong.</p>
		<p>She ignored the warmth of her body when Brooke reached across her to
			grab a book from Josh, and the slight brushes she was forced to
			endure. Such bittersweet torture, she wished she could just right an
			angsty poem about it and get it out of her system, but she'd tried
			that, and it hadn't worked. She needed something to distract her, and
			Lily's ranting was only making her wish she could bury her head in
			something to drown out the sound. She could think of a few choice
			places her head could be buried at the moment. Having the lurid
			thoughts at the moment was anything but conducive to her current state
			of being. She looked over at the oddity that was Harrison and Mary
			Cherry's relationship. That always did the trick. They were like some
			Maury, 'When Opposites Attract,' topic of the day guests. Never in a
			million years had she ever thought those two would end up together,
			but as she watched Harrison watching Mary Cherry, it somehow fit. He
			brought out a softer side to the blonde cheerleader, and she knew that
			Mary Cherry really loved him.</p>
		<p>He'd been right last year when he'd said that she and Brooke didn't
			really like him, they'd just disliked each other. Well, he'd been half
			right anyway. The only reason she'd even gone after him was because
			Brooke had somehow convinced her to exact revenge on him, but then the
			blonde had changed the rules midstream, and Sam had had no other
			choice but to play along. And now watching as he and Mary Cherry feed
			grapes to one another, she was glad he'd finally 'gotten the girl.'</p>
		<p>She looked over at Brooke, and the blonde offered her a big toothy
			grin. She just for once she could 'get the girl.'</p>
		<p>Sam sat on her bed with her laptop checking her email. Someone had
			responded to one of her posts in one of the communities she belonged
			to. She quickly signed into her clandestine journal and quickly
			replied to the comment. She really needed to post to her journal after
			enduring the day that she had. Brooke continued to stare at her with a
			suspicious look in her eye, and every time she would catch her, the
			blonde would blush and give her a shy smile. Sam wasn't sure how to
			take this new side of Brooke.</p>
		<p>"I guess tonight's post will be rather short. I have a pretty busy
			schedule of vegging to do and I would like to get to it in a hurry.
			School was pretty brutal today, but for more than one reason.. My evil
			physics teacher loaded me down with so much homework it took two hours
			to get through. She is totally heinous. I'm beginning to wonder about
			the mental health of our fair school system that puts these ghastly,
			power hungry, tyrannical dictators in charge of our education.
			Seriously, do they go out of their way to find these people or do they
			just pick them off the street at random.</p>
		<p>The other totally brutal part of my day was the beautiful torture I
			had to do endure from the oblivious object of my affection. She sent
			me sly glances the entire day, not even bothering to hide the fact she
			was caught staring. She just kept giving me these sweet smiles, and
			brushing up against me whenever she was near me. If I didn't already
			have her scent memorized I would have by the end of today. She just
			kept showing up everywhere I turned. I'm not sure if it was a
			coincidence or just the fates trying to play some sort of game with an
			unsuspecting mortal. Either way, if this continues, I don't know how I
			will be able to keep my feelings a secret with her constantly invading
			my every thought, and now every move. I am so totally screwed."</p>
		<p>She clicked the button that would post the entry. She then checked her
			email one last time, before messaging the blonde she'd just written about.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Ready to watch the oh so sexy, pelvis gyrating,
				Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Always...the rents are in bed, and I need the mind numbing
				sex appeal of Mr. Swayze to ease the tension from my very stressful day.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: lol...I wouldn't go that far, but there's just something
				about that movie...</tt>

				went and got the snacks. Let's just watch it in my room.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: How come we never hang in my room?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: My bed's more comfortable, and like I said, I already
				got the snacks. Besides your room has a funny smell. :p</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Hey!!</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Just get your ass in here, Mucky!</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: On my way, Princess.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>With that, she put her away message up and walked two doors down to
			the blonde's room.</p>
