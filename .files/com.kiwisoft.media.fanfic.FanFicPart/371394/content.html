<p>Author's note: Roses are red, violets are blue, sorry I took so long, so here's a chapter for you!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not nearly as poetic as Shakespeare, so there's not way I could've come up with this crap!</p>
<p><hr size=1 noshade>Viola/Sebastian entered the classroom amongst adoring and gushing fans, waving away pictures and autographs like a true pro. Or at least that was what was happening in her mind. Nevertheless, attention was still focused on her after last night's brilliant performance.</p>
<p>"Whats up my brothers?" she said easily as she slipped into the lab table of her fellow soccer players. Duke grunted and turned away slightly from her. Toby and Andrew greeted her enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Dude, I saw you come out of the girl's dorm this morning, man! Things must have moved pretty fast for you and Olivia, huh?" Andrew said with a lewd expression. If Viola had been drinking something at the time, it would have come spewing out several feet. Duke's jaw clenched visibly and his fists tightened.</p>
<p>"W-What?" Viola stuttered. It was true, after her shower, she had changed into her Sebastian outfit in Olivia's room and snuck out without much thought. She suddenly realized the implications of her actions for herself and Olivia. Too late, though. "Oh, right!" she suddenly said. "I was just giving her something she forgot and I was out and about, you know, being a guy so I stopped by really quick this morning. No biggie!" she finished anxiously while scratching the back of her head. She could tell the guys wanted to fish for more details but they were cut off by the teacher walking by with a bowl full of slips of paper.</p>
<p>"Pick a name and that person will be your lab partner." they said off-handedly as the group picked out names hastily to see who they would end up with.</p>
<p>"Eunice." Duke said aloud with a dubious look on his face. Toby looked disappointed. When Viola opened up her own slip she nearly sighed with relief.</p>
<p>"Olivia Lennox." as she said the name she heard said person stumbling into the classroom with a slight pant and a flustered look on her face.</p>
<p>"You're late, Miss Lennox." the teacher reprimanded her. Viola immediately felt bad for her, but wondered why the normally studious girl was late for class.</p>
<p>"Sorry, it won't happen again." Olivia said politely. Viola tried to wave to her but was suddenly immobilized by a death-glare burning with the fire of a thousand red suns being shot in her direction by Olivia herself. Viola lowered her hand awkwardly and gulped, not quit sure what she had done to earn such a menace-filled glance.</p>
<p>"Ouch, she don't look too happy. What did you do?" Duke finally spoke to her for the first time with a smirk on his face.</p>
<p>"Nothing this Man can't handle." Viola spoke with a confidence she didn't feel, but she nevertheless thumped a fist against her chest and tried not to wince at the pain that action brought to a particular girl-part. She spun on her heel and strode over to where Olivia sat bent over her notes. The blond practically radiated the feeling 'DON'T TALK TO ME!', but Viola braved the hostile environment and slipped onto the stool across from her companion.</p>
<p>"Hello stranger, I'll be your lab partner from now on." Viola said with her natural charm and friendly smile. Olivia raised her head from her notes with a sigh, deciding it was impossible to ignore the other girl, but still turned on her glare that made the boy-dressed-girl flinch.</p>
<p>"Let me ask you a very small question." Olivia started in a sweet quiet tone but with undertones of threatening implications. Viola sweat-dropped.</p>
<p>"Uh, sure." she responded uneasily.</p>
<p>"Did you seriously come out of my room this morning... Sebastian?" Olivia questioned. Viola's eyes widened. "Because all these coy looks and pats on the back I'm getting are starting to get really old really fast. Not to mention the dorm warden pulled me aside to lecture me about sneaking boys into the rooms and protection from STD's!" Olivia finished by crumbling one of her papers in her fist. Viola started laughing nervously.</p>
<p>"Oh, that... I'm sorry?" Viola let the words stumble out clumsily under Olivia's angry gaze. The blond girl sighed and rubbed her temple.</p>
<p>"You're unbelievable." she muttered.</p>
<p>"I try," Viola replied with her usual wit. Olivia couldn't help the corner's of her mouth turn up slightly at the comment. She took a sharp intake of breath when she felt Viola's warm hand cover her own on the table. "I'm sorry, Olivia, I wasn't thinking. I was just in such a good mood this morning and I didn't think about what I was doing. I could make it up to you later?" Viola offered with a hesitant smile.</p>
<p><i>Be mad be mad be mad</i>... Olivia was saying frantically in her head, already feeling the effects of Viola's sincere smile was having on her thought process. Even so, it was impossible to stay mad at her for long. Who cares that everyone thinks that they totally did IT? At that thought, Naked Viola flashed across her mind's eye and she valiantly fought the oncoming onslaught of pervy thoughts. Viola was still, after all, waiting for a response. Olivia nodded her head and smiled shyly at Viola.</p>
<p>"Apology accepted." she said and Viola breathed a huge sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Good! Because this whole dissecting thing really freaks me out, so I was hoping you'd take the reins on this one." Viola admitted in an embarrassed tone. Olivia couldn't help but smirk slightly at the admission.</p>
<p>"You know, most guys wouldn't admit that." Olivia teased as if reprimanding her for putting her shoes on backwards.</p>
<p>"Oh crap, you're right." Viola whispered, her eyes dodging to and fro to make sure no one caught that slip.</p>
<p>"No, don't. Actually, you'd be surprised at how many girls would think that was really sweet and cute." Olivia had a rosy tint to her cheeks as she spoke the words. Viola snorted disbelievingly.</p>
<p>"Yeah right. And Sebastian is the Queen of England by now."</p>
<p>Olivia wasn't sure to be grateful or annoyed by Viola's cluelessness.</p>
<p>"Actually, I'm absolutely terrified by dissections!" Malcolm cut in annoyingly.</p>
<p>"Oh really Malcolm, that's great." Olivia said brusquely, not bothering to look at her stalker. Viola glared at the desperate boy and he actually shrank away from her burning gaze. Viola suppressed the urge to growl at him to see if he would shriek and run away too. For some reason Viola just really hated that guy. Especially when he looked at Olivia.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>When Viola stepped out of the classroom her uniform was immediately snagged by a strong arm and dragged off the opposite way Olivia was walking. The blond watched as Duke half-dragged her pretend-boyfriend away from her and had a feeling it wasn't going to end very well.</p>
<p>"Hey, easy on the clothes there, tiger!" Viola complained as Duke forced her to sit on a bench across from him as soon as he ordered a scared freshman to get lost. Duke looked her in the eye with a steely determination that made Viola tingly all over.</p>
<p>"I've got a proposition for you, Hastings," Duke got right to the point. "I will help you on your soccer. I'll even make you good enough to make first string."</p>
<p>"By the Cornwall game?" Viola looked intrigued by this proposition. Duke nodded, seeming pleased that he had snagged his roommate's attention.</p>
<p>"Yeah, definitely. But you only got to do one thing for me." Viola looked at him expectantly, excitement seeping into her eyes. "Stop dating Olivia."</p>
