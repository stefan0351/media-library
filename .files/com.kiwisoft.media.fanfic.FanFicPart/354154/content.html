<!-- A Little Birdie Told Me So \ Part 4 -->

<P>Xander lay stretched out across the couch watching the
people spread out around the room surrounding him. Giles was in the corner of
the room sorting through some old musty books in boxes, Spike was sitting in
front of the stereo with head-phones on listening to an old Led Zeppelin album
and Anya had disappeared into one of the back rooms after announcing that she
was bored and none of them were entertaining her so she could as well just go to
sleep. Thinking back to her exit Xander had to smile. The girl was an original.
</p>
<P>What he was really paying attention to however, was Willow
and Buffy. They were sitting on chairs at opposite ends of the room not doing
much of anything. At first Willow had pretended to be interested in Giles' books
but she soon gave up on that. As for Buffy she had been flipping through the
same issue of Vogue for about an hour. Xander doubted that any of them had been
anything but a series of hoots and hollers to her since the picked up the
magazine. Neither of them was crying or throwing a hissy fit or anything, but he
could tell that something was bothering both of them. They had both been
freakishly quiet since arriving, and there was just this feeling of unease in
the air. He knew that the way their lives were it led to a lot of shifting,
shuffling emotions floating around all the time, but things had been relatively
quiet in town lately so he didn't understand what was up with them. Especially
since they had seemed happier in the past few weeks than in a long time,
especially Buffy. </p>
<P>Xander knew that he wasn't exactly "Share your soul with me"
guy. He was jokey friend guy and he understood his role, but it didn't stop him
from worrying, and from sometimes wishing that he was "Share your soul with me
guy". The people in the house (and his parent when they were nice to him), were
his entire world, except of course for Spike. But he wasn't Mr. Emotional Chat
man, so he mostly had to let his actions be the testament of his feeling for
them all. </p>
<P>But, as he lay there watching them, he didn't know what
action he could take that would help. </p>
<P>"Hey!" Spike said breaking Xander's musings. He was banging
on the top of Giles' record player. "Fix it," he continued in the same agitated
voice. </p>
<P>"Stop that right now," Giles said getting up and walking
over to where Spike was. "You're going to break it." </p>
<P>"It's not working," Spike said still banging away.
</p>
<P>"That's because you keep hitting it," Giles said trying to
get Spike to stop. </p>
<P>"Slag off," Spike said waving his hands about trying to get
Giles to leave him alone. </p>
<P>Giles took a step back and just stared at him a for moment.
</p>
<P>"I haven't gone to the butchers yet," Giles finally said in
a warning. </p>
<P>"I'll be good," Spike promised even though he was glaring at
Giles like he wanted to rip his limbs from his body. Giles smiled and walked
back over to his books. </p>
<P>Once Spike was what Giles deemed a safe distance away from
his record player things calmed down once more. </p>
<P>"Buffy," Willow said looking over to where her friend was
sitting. </p>
<P>"What's up?" Buffy asked. She was already halfway across the
room. </p>
<P>"How would you feel about doing a little heavy lifting?"
Willow asked flashing Buffy her most charming smile. </p>
<P>"I'd feel like a sucker, but I'll do it anyway," Buffy
responded coming to stand behind Willow. Willow smiled up at Buffy and the
Slayer kneeled down to await instructions. </p>
<P>As Willow started directing Buffy to the boxes which needed
to be moved and where they needed to be moved to, Xander got off the couch
(finally) and followed Spike when the vampire began to move into the backrooms.
He still didn't trust vamp-boy and Anya was back there. </p>
<P>'What do you think you're doing?" Spike asked swinging
around to face Xander. </p>
<P>"Making sure that you don't eat my Anya," Xander responded
getting right up in Spike's face. </p>
<P>"As if," Spike responded before making a face at his own
response. He'd been in California for too long…way too long. </p>
<P>"What? Like you're so above eating people?" Xander
responded. </p>
<P>"I'm above eating her," Spike said getting in Xander's face.
"Not that I could even I wanted to," he added backing away. </p>
<P>"So I hear you and Buffy spent some quality time together
yesterday," Xander said. He wasn't quite finished with Spike yet. "Should I be
dusting off the ol' tux?" </p>
<P>"Go away," Spike said testily. </p>
<P>"What's going on here?" Xander asked. He wanted some
answers. He knew that Spike was in the middle of whatever was going on. Then
again Xander blamed famine and just about every other bad thing on Spike too.
</p>
<P>"I'm GOING to take a nap," Spike said in response. "Day time
is sleep time." </p>
<P>"Alright, that's it lemon-head," Xander said pushing Spike
against the wall. "I want to know what you did to Buffy and Willow." </p>
<P>"I didn't do anything," Spike said indignantly. "She tried
to stake me!" </p>
<P>"If she tried to stake you, you'd be dust," Xander
responded. </p>
<P>"Listen you bloody moron, whatever is going on between Muffy
and Pine tree out there has nothing to do with me," Spike responded. </p>
<P>"And I'm suppose to just take your oh so not trustworthy
word on that?" Xander asked. </p>
<P>"I cannot believe that you're a critical part of the 'on
crack' team that routinely foiled my plans," Spike responded shaking his head.
"Just look at them, for the love of God, just bloody look at them!" he said
waving his hand in the direction of the two girls. "If I have to be witness to
one more poignant silence, or longing gaze I'll throw myself on a damn stake."
</p>
<P>Xander turned his head to look at Buffy and Willow and see
if he could make any sense whatsoever out of what Spike was saying. When he
watched them he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. It looked like Buffy
had just finished with the boxes and was helping Willow and Giles put away the
rest of the books. Giles was saying something to Willow, what it was Xander
couldn't hear, and Buffy was listening. The Slayer had her hand resting on
Willow's shoulder but was looking in Giles' direction. Shortly after that the
Watcher got up and headed for the kitchen shooting Xander and Spike an odd look
as he did. Xander ignored it and continued to watch his friends. Buffy, her hand
still on Willow's shoulder, kneeled down so that they were now side by side on
the floor. Once she was down there she leaned over and whispered something into
Willow's ear. Whatever it was it must have been amusing because Willow broke out
into a huge grin and eventually ended up shaking her head and looking down at
the ground. </p>
<P>"I don't know what you're talking about, there's nothing…"
Xander started to say to Spike, but then he was interrupted when he saw
something that he hadn't noticed before. Buffy had shifted position so that she
was now sitting cross legged on the floor and was putting away books too. It
wasn't that that caught his attention, but the expression on Willow's face. She
was watching Buffy intently, a small, gentle smile playing across her face. Then
Buffy turned her head and Willow quickly returned her gaze to the books in front
of her. Then, while Willow was busy putting away some of the books Buffy looked
at her with the same kind of look Willow had been giving her moments before.
There seemed to be this potential energy surrounding Buffy as she looked at
Willow, like in chemistry or psychics. It was like she wanted to do something,
but couldn't. Like she was just lying in wait for her potential energy to be
released. </p>
<P>Xander backed away from Spike, who muttered something then
went into the kitchen to badger Giles, but continued to watch the interaction
between Buffy and Willow. There was something captivating about it and he
couldn't quite pull himself away. It was like he was on the verge of making a
great discovery. As he watched them he remembered what Spike had said, and it
did seem kind of poignant. Even though he didn't really know what he was looking
at, there was something there it could feel it…see it, even from where he was.
Then another thing Spike had said started ringing in his head. Longing. And
there was longing there, you could see it in their eyes, if you were looking for
it that was. </p>
<P>He leaned back against the wall confused. He didn't
understand what he was seeing. He didn't understand what was going on.
</p>
<P>"What are you doing? Are we hiding?" Anya asked sneaking up
behind him. Xander jumped slightly. "What are we hiding from?" </p>
<P>"We're not hiding," Xander said glancing over at her.
</p>
<P>"That's good cause this really isn't a good spot," she
responded rubbing her hand over his pecks. "Maybe we SHOULD go hide," she
suggested a moment later sliding up against him. </p>
<P>"I can't, not now," Xander said returning his attention to
the two girls in the living room. </p>
<P>"Why not?" Anya whined. </p>
<P>"I'm trying to solve a problem. It's important," Xander
said. </p>
<P>"What is it? Maybe I can help," she said looking over his
shoulder. "I want to have an orgasm." </p>
<P>"What did I tell you about saying things like that in
public?" Xander asked turning around. </p>
<P>"But we aren't in public…not really," Anya pointed out. They
were the only ones in the hallway. </p>
<P>"Right," Xander said turning his head again. "Is it just me
or do you sense something going on between them?" he asked waving in Buffy and
Willow's general direction. </p>
<P>"Nothing more than usual," Anya said trying to drag Xander
into the bedroom. </p>
<P>"Usual?" Xander asked. </p>
<P>"Uh huh," Anya said still tugging to no avail. </p>
<P>"What's the usual?" Xander asked wondering if he was the
only person in the dark about this mystery 'thing' going on. </p>
<P>"Sexual tension/frustration, unrequited love yadda, yadda,
yadda," Anya responded. "Is that it? Can we have sex now?" </p>
<P>"What?" Xander asked in a high pitched voice. </p>
<P>"They obviously want to sleep together, but no doubt some
stupid human emotion is keeping them from telling each other, so they just sit
there holding hands pretending they don't want to have sex, while
unintentionally charging the air around them with unresolved sexual tension.
It's sad really, sex is good and they'd make good orgasm friends," Anya
responded. "Can we please have sex now?" </p>
<P>Xander turned around and stared at Anya for a second. Buffy
and Willow…that way? No way. Buffy and Willow didn't…they weren't…that was just
nuts. </p>
<P>"You're silly," Xander said finally. "Stop being so silly,"
he continued. "You silly girl…silly." </p>
<P>"Fine," Anya said. "I'll take care of it myself," and with
that she headed back in the direction she had come from. </p>
<P>Xander watched her go but he was rooted to the spot where he
was. He had known Willow for almost his entire life, and he'd known Buffy for a
good portion of his adolescence. He thought that he knew them as well as anyone
else, and he thought that he would be aware if there was anything 'gay' about
them. No, he thought to himself, they're just good friends, best friends. He
knew that he and Jesse never went around holding hands and hugging each other,
but they were guys and guys and girls acted differently. Lots of girls,
completely heterosexual girls, who were friends were close like Buffy and
Willow. Still, looking at them sitting there…there seemed to be something more.
</p>
<P>He shook his head, they couldn't be…could they? Nah, he was
just watching pay-per view a wee bit too much. If they were he would
know…wouldn't he? Of course. Right? </p>
