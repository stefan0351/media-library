<p><b>Chapter 8</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lilly stepped out of her SUV, letting the smell of fresh cut grass sweep over her. As much as she missed California, she quite enjoyed the scenery and the air here in Tennessee. One in particular had caught her eye and she smiled as she walked up to the large tree. It looked ancient, dark and gnarly, a thick trunk and branches reaching high into the sky. Just below, lying in its shade, was the object of her affections. Lilly stopped a few steps away, just watching the girl.</p>
<p>Miley was stretched out in the dirt, head bedded against one of the large tree's roots. Her eyes were closed and she seemed to be sleeping peacefully. She was wearing jeans that had seen better days, rips and tears and dirt that made them almost look like expensive designer ones, and a white wife beater showing off the bruises and scratches on her arms. Her feet were bare. A cat was stretched out along Miley's arm, while another had curled up on top of her stomach. Their eyes followed Lilly as she stepped closer and squatted next to her friend.</p>
<p>She hadn't been able to think of anything but that kiss and how she'd missed out on really enjoying it. For once, Miley had not been grounded and though they'd met at the diner twice during the week, Lilly had been too preoccupied with studying for her finals to have much time for Miley. But now, her last final behind her and a whole three months of freedom ahead, Lilly was finally going to do what she wanted.</p>
<p>One of the cats gave her an angry glare as she leaned closer. Lilly knelt in the dirt next to Miley, suddenly nervous. Miley was beautiful, gorgeous, adorable and Lilly's heart swelled just looking at her. She'd never held such intense feelings for anyone and it scared her. She pushed those thoughts away. Maybe she needed to live more like Miley – free and spontaneous. Lilly leaned forward and pressed her lips to the sleeping girl's. She held the contact longer than Miley had done the other day and though the kiss was almost innocent in its simplicity, her head swam from excitement.</p>
<p>When she finally pulled away, two blue eyes were looking into hers. Miley's gaze was intense and Lilly was worried she'd misread everything, before that waggish grin broke out across Miley's face. She sat up, displacing the cat on her chest, though her eyes never left Lilly's. Lilly was mesmerized by Miley's eyes, by whatever sparkled in them and pulled her in and wouldn't let her go.</p>
<p>"Hey there, sleeping beauty," said Lilly softly, suddenly feeling immensely bold. Perhaps it was her good mood over school having ended, or how adorable Miley was, but she was not going to let it go to waste. Miley smiled again and it was so warm and open Lilly had to swallow hard. She cupped Miley's cheek and leaned in again, bringing their lips together.</p>
<p>If Miley was surprised at all by her bold actions, she did not let it show. Their lips merged with slow passion. They did not hurry, nor get drawn under in greed and lust. It was soft and sweet, as if they were merely trying each other out, but before long Lilly traced her tongue across Miley's lips. Miley's mouth opened to give her access and their tongues brushed against each other. Warmth spread through Lilly's body and her head swam. She still had her hand on Miley's cheek and moved it to the back of her neck to pull the girl closer. Neither of them sought to deepen the kiss, to push harder, but merely reveled in the softness.</p>
<p>Lilly drew away after what felt like an eternity. She did not move the hand from Miley's neck. Their eyes met once again, the intensity of their connection overwhelming. Both were breathing heavily and their hearts thundered in unison. Lilly moved her hand to brush her thumb across the other girl's lips, wiping away the moisture still clinging to them. Miley's breath was hot against her hand and Lilly shivered. How could one kiss leave her feeling like she had run a marathon, won the lottery and been electrocuted all at the same time?</p>
<p>Miley smiled as Lilly sat back on her heels, though for once her eyes held no mischief. "I don't think I could have asked for a better first kiss."</p>
<p>Lilly looked at her slightly confused, after all, they had sort of kissed that day in the truck, even if Lilly hadn't responded. But seeing the reverent look in Miley's eyes, she realized with a shock what the girl had meant. "Y-you mean, your first kiss…ever?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded, the smile never leaving her face. Lilly suddenly felt sad and a little guilty for just having kissed Miley without asking. What if she had wanted her first kiss to be with someone else? "I'm sorry, Miley, I didn't know."</p>
<p>"Why? It was perfect…outdoors, under my favorite tree, with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Why would you be sorry?"</p>
<p>Lilly laughed slightly, realizing that something that might freak out another girl just didn't bother Miley. She did not seem to ever second-guess anything that happened and Lilly was glad for it. She exhaled. One of the cats brushed up against her and she absentmindedly rubbed its head. She knew what she wanted to ask, but wasn't sure how Miley would react. Then again, she had never seen Miley really upset over anything and people were horrible to her. She sighed.</p>
<p>"Miley, are you gay?"</p>
<p>Miley narrowed her eyes, though it did not look like she was angry. Lilly knew that meant she was about to be difficult and suppressed a groan. "Do <b>you</b> think I'm gay?"</p>
<p>"Miles, it's kinda hard for me to say, not being you and all." Miley smiled stupidly and Lilly raised an eyebrow. "What?"</p>
<p>"You called me 'Miles'. My daddy used to call me that…"</p>
<p>Lilly flushed, feeling horrible now. "Miley, I'm sorry, I didn't know…I…"</p>
<p>Miley stopped her with a shake of her head, "No, I like it when you say it."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, but then realized the change of topic. "Can we get back on track?"</p>
<p>"You think I'm gay."</p>
<p>"No, I asked if you thought you were," said Lilly, exasperated. Why was this girl so difficult?</p>
<p>"So, you have a lot of straight girls kissing you then?" asked Miley, voice serious, but the mischievous sparkle in her eyes gave her away.</p>
<p>Lilly groaned. She wanted to shake the girl. "Miley, you're impossible. I just want to know if I'm wasting my time here."</p>
<p>Miley frowned. "Why would you be wasting your time?"</p>
<p>She actually sounded genuinely hurt and Lilly closed her eyes in defeat. She decided the answer didn't matter. If she was honest with herself, she knew Miley liked her and she liked Miley and anything else shouldn't even matter. Lilly sighed and opened her eyes. Those intense blue eyes were watching her closely.</p>
<p>"Miley, do you want to go on a date with me sometime?" Despite her resolution, Lilly suddenly felt nervous. She'd been on plenty of dates before, but she'd never been this nervous just asking someone.</p>
<p>"A real date?" asked Miley, sounding skeptical.</p>
<p>"Yes, a real date. I like you and I want to take you out." Lilly decided using Miley's forward approach might benefit her in this situation.</p>
<p>Miley hardly hesitated before grabbing her hand and jumping up, leaving Lilly no choice but to follow suit. Miley's face shone with excitement. "Let's go tonight!"</p>
<p>It took Lilly several moments to even register her words and when she did, the younger girl was already pulling her towards the house. She stopped her. "Whoa, Miles, slow down. We can't go tonight."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I need some time to plan something, make it perfect."</p>
<p>Miley laughed as if she'd said something funny. "I'll be with you, it'll be perfect regardless."</p>
<p>Lilly was too stunned by her words to put up a protest as Miley dragged her into the house. Her excitement was palpable. Much to Lilly's chagrin, both Miley's mother and grandmother were in the kitchen when they entered. She hoped Miley would not share her news, but knew the chance was slim. Miley never held back.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm going on a date. Tonight." Lilly smacked her forehead, almost wishing they couldn't see her standing in the doorway. But Miley was already pulling her by the hand into the kitchen. Both women stared at them, confusion on their faces.</p>
<p>"A date? With whom?" Susan saw the excitement clearly written on her daughter's face and knew it spelled trouble.</p>
<p>Miley looked at her like she was stupid. "With Lilly."</p>
<p>Susan's mouth opened, but no words came out. She looked at her mother for help, but the woman would not meet her eyes. Miley was looking at her expectantly, while Lilly stood by her side, looking terrified. Susan finally forced a smile onto her face and Miley grinned, before running off to her bedroom to get changed. Susan turned her attention to Lilly, who had just realized she was all alone with the two women.</p>
<p>"So, Lilly, where are you planning to take Miley?" asked Susan casually, but the way she was chopping vegetables belied her calmness.</p>
<p>Lilly stared at her like a deer in headlights. She hadn't thought past asking Miley out and then had practically been run over with this plan to go tonight. But Lilly knew she would do nothing to shatter the girl's excitement. "I uh…umm…"</p>
<p>"You did ask her out, did you not?"</p>
<p>She rubbed a hand across her forehead, feeling the sweat building up. "Yeah…I did."</p>
<p>"But you don't know where you're going." It was not a question and Lilly did not respond. Susan was quiet for a few moments, returning to her vegetables, before looking back up. Her eyes were dark. "Look, Lilly, whatever you're doing, I beg you to stop. Miley doesn't…she doesn't understand <b>this</b>…this trickery you're doing. She was so hurt after last time and I just…I can't stand seeing her like that again. So whatever it is…a dare…a lost bet…just please don't do this to her."</p>
<p>Lilly stared at the woman, more and more questions running through her brain. At first she'd expected Susan to be concerned about the gay thing, but that didn't seem to be it at all. It was the whole crazy protection thing all over again, but judging by the woman's words, something had happened before. She had said 'the last time'. Lilly remembered Miley mentioning a date that hadn't gone well and Miley's mom mentioning a boy she was not fond of. But Lilly did not understand why the woman thought she was taking Miley out on a dare.</p>
<p>"I'm not…here to hurt Miley, Mrs. Stewart. I really like her a-and I think she likes me, too." Lilly tried to sound as convincing as possible, but she was nervous. Parents normally liked her, but these were totally different circumstances.</p>
<p>"Miley likes a lot of things she shouldn't," said the woman, but when her mother gave her a stern look, she sighed. "She was so hurt last time…tried not to show it, of course, that's Miley…her daddy had half a mind to rip that boy's arms off…"</p>
<p>Lilly clenched her jaw at the thought of someone hurting Miley, but she still didn't understand <b>why</b>. No one seemed to want to give her any answers. "What happened?"</p>
<p>Susan looked at her, as if she didn't want to share that information, but then shook her head. "That hotshot Jake Ryan asked her out. Her daddy and I had never let her date before, because of…well…but she was so excited, we just couldn't say 'no'. And the boy was a charmer…so we let her go. Turns out he'd lost a bet…he must have said some really mean things to her, because…Miley was upset and she doesn't let much get to her."</p>
<p>The more answers she got, the more questions she had. Miley could not date because of <b>what</b>? Why would a teenage boy need to lose a bet to take out a gorgeous girl? Lilly shook her head, wishing someone would just give her all the facts. She thought back to the woman's story. "Jake Ryan? I think he goes to my school; he's in a wheelchair?"</p>
<p>Susan's mouth twitched almost imperceptibly, but Lilly had noticed. The woman was cutting her vegetables again, though they were already as small as possible. "Yeah, that's him. He used to be a big football star. A few years ago he got injured during a game."</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes narrowed, "Serves him right." Susan looked up, shocked at the girl's words. She shrugged. "He shouldn't have done what he did. Miley is the sweetest, most carefree person I have ever met; I just don't understand wanting to hurt her. Look, Mrs. Stewart, the truth is…yes, I asked Miley out, but…I didn't mean for tonight, so I didn't think of places to go. She just got so excited…I couldn't take that away from her."</p>
<p>Susan looked at her for a while then nodded, "You cannot go into Crowley. Murfreesboro isn't too far and it's got some very nice places to eat and a movie theater. Miley will eat just about anything, but she really loves Chinese. Lilly, you take care of my little girl and you make her happy and we'll be okay, got that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>Susan returned to her vegetables, finally realizing they were basically mush and turned to throw them into the pot on the stove. Lilly felt like she'd just gone three rounds in a boxing ring and somehow survived. Then she realized, she was going on a date with Miley and suddenly she was all nerves.</p>
