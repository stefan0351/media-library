<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 1:  -->

<p>Joey's eyes were open for almost a minute before she figured out that she was awake. She was coughing hard, and swallowed a few times to try to calm her spastic throat. The last thing she needed was to wake the baby-- then Bessie would wake up, too, and she'd never hear the end of it. She breathed in slowly, trembling slightly, and decided she needed a glass of water. Reluctantly, she threw off her covers, trying not to open her eyes all the way; she was not "officially" awake.</p>
		<p>She felt terribly unsettled; what had she been dreaming about? Fleeting images tumbled through her foggy head, thoughts, emotions, but nothing she could string together. By the time she reached the kitchen sink, those too were gone, leaving her anticipating something she wasn't sure of. She sipped the water carefully, breathing more deeply as it cooled her throat. This always happens when the seasons change, she thought miserably. Her body responded directly to the confusion of her physical environment, the earth turning into or out of things. She gulped down the last of her water, wiped the back of her sleeve against her damp forehead, and went back to bed, falling asleep almost instantly.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Good morning, my fine friend," Pacey slapped Dawson cordially on the back as he strolled up to the shady spot under a tree where Dawson stood waiting. "Where's your better half? Keeping you waiting?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Pace, you know it's not like Joey to be late for school. Maybe she's sick. I'm gonna call her at lunch if she doesn't show up." Pacey shrugged and popped a cherry Life-Saver in his mouth.</p>
		<p>"She works too hard, anyway. Might as well take a day off from Capeside Correctional Facility," he remarked, laughing.</p>
		<p>"What's gotten into you?" Dawson asked, laughing in return to Pacey's unusually high spirits.</p>
		<p>"Well, I'd hate for this to get around, cause I can't have all the babes of Capeside knocking down my door, but--" and here he rubbed his hands together conspiratorially, grinning like a hyena-- "it just so happens that Sheriff Whitter has decided not to scrap the old blue truck o'terror after all. Seems it makes for a good experiment in a certain lazy, no good son's character development."</p>
		<p>"Dude, your dad's giving you the truck? No way!" Dawson dropped his backpack on the grass and slammed Pacey's hands with his own in excitement.</p>
		<p>"I have to get it running again, is the only catch," Pacey said, a slight notch lower on the excitement factor.</p>
		<p>"No sweat, Pace, I've got a few connections in the Capeside High Custodial department...sneaking into the film lab on weekends does have its advantages. I think I can get us hooked up."</p>
		<p>"Sweet! That's what I like to hear, Dawson. Always a team effort, right? Okay, I'm late for first-period S&M lashings," he chuckled, and headed towards the gym. Dawson turned and picked his backpack up, scanning his field of vision once more for Joey. Finding no trace of her, he sighed and headed towards the school building, bereft of his morning kiss. He resolved that the next one would be twice as good-- and twice as long.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"A hundred and two, Sweetie," Bessie said gently, reading the thermometer. "You're booked for a two-day minimum." Joey smiled faintly, reminded of her mother's old rule: twenty-four hours without a fever before you go back to school. Her slightly clouded thoughts drifted towards her mother then; things had been so much easier. Some of it was just what comes with age, perhaps. As a child she'd be almost glad to be pronounced sick by her mother, given a spoonful of cherry-flavored Tylenol and a cup of sweet orange tea, and read to until she feel asleep. Now she just took the regular, flavorless pills, sweetened her own tea and read to herself, if she could focus enough to read at all. Usually she couldn't, and she'd fall asleep worrying about the schoolwork she was missing.</p>
		<p>"Jo? Do you think you'll be okay by yourself?" Bessie was turning the cloth on Joey's head over to the cool side, her voice concerned but her eyes clearly anxious, it seemed to Joey. Bessie missing a day at the restaurant was a lot worse than Joey missing school, and she tried to only do it in emergencies.</p>
		<p>"Go ahead," Joey said hoarsely. "I'll just sleep anyway. You don't need to watch me." Her eyes were heavy, and she already felt halfway gone.</p>
		<p>"You know the number if you need anything," Bessie said, relieved, and kissed Joey lightly on the cheek before running out the door with Alex strapped into his car seat in tow. Joey coughed and rolled over onto her side, noticing the little white pills Bessie had left next to a half-full glass of orange juice on her bedside table. She thought about moving her arm to pick them up, but then she'd have to pick up the orange juice, too, and sit up to drink it...before she finished deciding, her eyes were closed.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>The lunch bell, it seemed to the students of Capeside, had a distinctly more cheerful reverberant quality than the other bells, with the exception of the last-period bell, which was most musical of all. The cafeteria door burst open with activity, as the swarm scattered into those headed for the lunch line and those staking out tables. Dawson went for his usual table, having brought his lunch, and was soon joined by Jen and Pacey, who were already engaged in conversation.</p>
		<p>"...it really blew my fucking mind," Jen was saying as she sat down.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me?" Dawson inquired, his attention quickly turned from his turkey-on-rye.</p>
		<p>"Oh-- I'm sure this will amuse you, Dawson, since you and I can now talk about these matters with the greatest of ease-- Cliff wants me to go to the senior Prom with him!" Jen was laughing as she spoke, as if the senior Prom were the equivalent of Saturday detention.</p>
		<p>"So what's funny about that?" Dawson asked, bewildered slightly. He thought he knew Jen fairly well by now, and this reaction made no sense that he could see.</p>
		<p>"Come on, Dawson, you were there for both dates Cliff took me on. They weren't exactly stellar. Hardly worth the price of a Prom dress."</p>
		<p>"Jeez, Jen, it seems like a good enough opportunity, it's not like you've got to sign the pre-nuptuals right then and there," Dawson persisted, a bit amused at the irony of his trying to persuade Jen to go out with Cliff.</p>
		<p>"I'm just finally beginning to realize that I don't have to take every opportunity that comes my way, that's all," Jen shrugged, opening her soda. "I kind of want to be on my own for a while, feel out the terrain. That's why I broke it off with you, if you can remember back to the pre-Joey period of world history," she said laughing.</p>
		<p>"Speaking of Joey," Dawson said, getting up from his chair, "I'm gonna go call her and make sure she's okay, since she's not in school." He jogged out of the cafeteria to find a phone somewhere quieter, leaving Pacey to make a few cracks about the new developments in Jen's sex life, or lack thereof. He ended up going out to the front door of the building; since it was a chilly day, and the snow was in the muddy-ice stage, he felt sure no one would be out there.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>The alarm clock in Joey's dream wouldn't turn off, even after she hit the button and unplugged it and threw it on the floor. It was driving her crazy. Then she realized it was really a police siren. Had she forgotten to do something important? Did her father tell them she did something bad, that she was a drug dealer too?</p>
		<p>She opened her eyes and picked up the phone all in one moment. "Hello?" she murmured, meaning to speak normally but finding her voice not quite under her control.</p>
		<p>"Joey? You sound awful. Did I wake you up?"</p>
		<p>"Dawson," Joey sighed to herself, glad to have something to focus on. "I thought you were the police."</p>
		<p>"What?" Dawson said, bewildered. "Why? Is something wrong?"</p>
		<p>"No, I just had a dream...I think I left the oven on..." she stopped abruptly and began to cough. Dawson waited, worrying.</p>
		<p>"Jo? Are you still there?"</p>
		<p>"Uh-huh," she mumbled through her orange juice, trying to clear her throat. "Sorry, Dawson. I'm a little foggy, that's all. I don't feel so good."</p>
		<p>"You don't sound so good. Is Bessie there with you?"</p>
		<p>"She's at work...it got so cold in here, Dawson." Joey began to shiver, burying herself deeper under her blanket.</p>
		<p>Dawson was getting a lot more worried now, listening to her teeth chatter. She sounded a little delirious. Wasn't it a low-grade fever when you felt hot, and a high one when you felt cold?</p>
		<p>"I'll be there in twenty minutes, Jo. Don't go anywhere." He hung up the phone and pulled his backpack over his shoulder, running down the stairs and away from the building.</p>
		<p>Inside, the bell rang for fourth period, and Pacey collected Dawson's lunch and tossed it into his own backpack. He'd probably be starved by the time he got off the phone with the love of his life.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Dawson knocked loudly, hoping Joey was awake. He called her name a couple of times, and was just about to consider climbing in a side window when the door opened. Joey was a mess; her face was pale, her hair damp against her forehead and temples, and dark circles hung under her eyes. She was shivering slightly, and her lips, which were almost more pale than her face, were trembling.</p>
		<p>"Dawson?" she said, registering a slight state of confusion. "You shouldn't come in. I'm sick." She began to cough harshly at that moment, as if it could have proven the point more. She braced herself against the doorframe; it seemed as if the energy it took her to cough was more than she could manage to also stand up. Dawson quickly circled his arm around her waist, supporting her as he led her back inside.</p>
		<p>"I know you're sick, Angel, that's why I came. I'm gonna take care of you, okay?" He brought her back to her bed and laid her down gently, pulling the covers up over her.</p>
		<p>"Can I have another blanket?" she asked weakly, recovering her breath from her most recent coughing spasm.</p>
		<p>"Sure," Dawson said softly, laying his hand on her forehead. "Wow, Jo, you're really hot. Did you take any aspirin or anything yet today?" She turned her head to her bedside table, cluttered with tissues and cough drop wrappers.</p>
		<p>"I think so...I think there was some on this table, but...Mom said I could have the cherry kind..." Dawson froze. A slight taste of panic rose in his throat. Joey must really be out of it, if she's talking about her mom like she's still alive.</p>
		<p>"Okay, hold on a minute, I'm going to go get you a blanket," he said, trying not to sound scared. He hurried out to the hall closet, where he pulled out an extra blanket and then ran to the baby's room to get the instant-ear thermometer. This is nothing unusual, he told himself over and over. This happens almost every year. Joey always got sick before the snow melted, and as a little boy, Dawson remembered, he often brought her the first flower of spring as a get-well present. But he'd never really seen her like this. He had to wonder, is this what it's like for parents?</p>
		<p>"Okay, here we go," he said in his most upbeat voice, laying the heavy quilt over a tightly curled Joey, her breath raspy.</p>
		<p>"Shit, Dawson, I'm so cold," she whispered, pulling the new blanket tightly around her.</p>
		<p>"I know, Joey, I know. You're okay, it's going to be fine." As he spoke, he slipped the thermometer into her ear gently, and pushed the little button. It took only a few seconds to register. Beeep!</p>
		<p>Dawson consulted the small screen, his breath catching in his throat. A hundred and three point six. That was definitely outside the range of a normal fever, he was sure. He looked around the room for a minute, starting to panic, not knowing what the next thing he should do was. Joey was murmuring something about orange tea. Dawson ran to the phone.</p>
		<p>"Hello...can I speak to Gale Leary please? Well this is her son, can you please tell her it's an emergency?" He only had to wait a minute before his mother came to the phone with a measure of controlled panic in her voice.</p>
		<p>"Dawson? What's wrong, Honey?"</p>
		<p>"Mom, I'm at Joey's, and she's really sick, I mean she's got a really high fever, and I'm scared and I don't know what to do." Dawson's words tumbled out quickly, unsorted.</p>
		<p>"Okay Sweetie, just calm down," Mrs. Leary seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. What kinds of things did parents envision when their child called saying it was an emergency? Whatever it was, Dawson thought, a high fever must be the least of a parent's worst case scenarios.</p>
		<p>"Did you take her temperature?" Mrs. Leary asked evenly.</p>
		<p>"A hundred and three point six!" Dawson cried, remembering his fear.</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay, shhh. You're right, that is pretty high. Did she take any Tylenol yet?"</p>
		<p>"I don't think so," Dawson replied, somewhat more controlled. "At least not since I've been here."</p>
		<p>"Okay, well you've got to get her to take some. If she can't swallow the pill, break it up in a spoonful of juice. Then you've got to get some ice on her, as much as you can. On her forehead, the back of her neck, her stomach...as much as she can take."</p>
		<p>"But she says she's freezing," Dawson said a little more evenly, his mother's composure beginning to float into him through the phone line.</p>
		<p>"That's normal for a high fever, but she doesn't have any choice. I'm sure she's in no shape to fight you over it. Now am I correct in assuming you haven't called Bessie yet?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah," Dawson admitted.</p>
		<p>"Alright then, I'll call her now and then I'll meet you there. I'm sure she'll need someone to take Alexander for a while. ...are you okay with all of this, Dawson?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah Mom, absolutely. Aspirin. Juice. Ice. I'll see you in a little while." He hung up the phone quickly, and headed back to Joey's room. She was still murmuring to herself, just barely whispering; she might have been talking in her sleep, except that her eyes were just slightly open. Dawson picked up the bottle of Tylenol that stood on top of the bureau and opened it, shaking two into his hand.</p>
		<p>"Joey?" he asked in a clear, even voice. "Can you sit up and swallow these?" He brushed her damp hair off her hot face, circling his other arm behind her neck.</p>
		<p>"Mmmm," Joey looked up at him, seeming startled, but letting him help her sit up a bit. He gave her the pills and held the glass up to her lips, hoping ferverently that she wouldn't choke. Thankfully, she didn't, and he thought she should probably get as much water as she could, so he waited until she stopped drinking to take a breath.</p>
		<p>"Good, Jo. See, it's not so bad, right?" He laid her back down easily, and stroked her forehead for a moment before heading for the kitchen. "I'll be right back, okay baby?" She gave a faint reply before closing her eyes again, and Dawson darted out.</p>
		<p>First he hunted for a few dish rags to wrap the ice in, then he went into the freezer. They had a lot of ice trays, Dawson was relieved to see, and he emptied them all. He quickly made up four ice packs, and hurried back to Joey's room.</p>
		<p>"It's going to be a little cold now, Joey, but it'll make you feel better, okay?" he spoke to her tenderly.</p>
		<p>"No," she protested weakly, "I'm too cold already." Dawson was glad she was at least lucid enough to speak to him.</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Jo, you have to," he said firmly, and without waiting for her reply, he pulled her blankets aside and began applying the ice. She gave a faint cry when the first one touched her skin, and took in a deep breath. She reached her hand down to her stomach, but she didn't try to move the ice. Dawson slipped the second one behind her head, resting the back of her neck on it; the next one on her forehead, and the last against her side. She began to cry weakly, and a tear slid down the side of her cheek.</p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry, Joey, but this is going to make you better." He held her hand in both of his, and kissed it.</p>
		<p>"Dawson?" Joey whispered through her tears.</p>
		<p>"What, baby?" he asked kindly.</p>
		<p>"Will you tell me a story?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, sure I will," he said before he knew what he was doing. Without even thinking, he began a whimsical tale about a prince and a princess, who lived in a vast, beautiful kingdom in a land far, far away...</p>
