<p>When she awoke to sunlight streaming on her face, Brooke was
immediately aware of two things: 1) the bed really was much more
comfortable than the floor ever was and 2) somewhere during the night
the line between sharing the bed, blankets and body heat had been
crossed over into cuddling.  With Sam.  She was pressed up very close
to Sam, with her nose buried in Sam's hair because Sam's head was
resting on her shoulder.  Brooke jolted to full awakeness with this
realization and threw herself back away from Sam's form, therefore
throwing herself unceremoniously off the bed onto the floor.  She
landed on her butt with a 'whoomp'.</p>

<p>"That sounded painful," Sam's sleepy voice called out from the bed.
Brooke heard the blankets ruffle and soon Sam's sleep filled face
appeared over the edge of the bed.  "You OK?"  Brooke
nodded.  "Cool.  Switch to decaf, OK?"</p>

<p>"Uhm, good morning," Brooke finally managed to utter from her
vantagepoint on the floor.  Sam cocked her head to the side and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Good morning.  Do I really look that frightening this early in the
morning or was it something else?"</p>

<p>"Uhm...neither?" Brooke asked, desperately looking for a way out of
what could possibly be a very awkward situation.  &lt;Not that that was
a bad way to wake up.  I could soooo get used to that.  She's so soft
and…ARGH.  Right.  Keep dreaming McQueen&gt;</p>

<p>"You really aren't a morning person, are you?" Sam joked, giving her
a way out.  If Sam was aware of how they had been situated before
Brooke's mad dash to escape, she wasn't letting on.  And for that,
Brooke was infinitely thankful.</p>

<p>Sam, however, was acutely aware of where they'd ended up during the
night.  She'd woken up shortly before Brooke had and lacking the
physical capability to remove herself without waking Brooke, simply
lay there and waited until Brooke woke up on her own.  Not that she
really minded the hardship.  The blonde looked so sweet and innocent
during slumber that Sam wouldn't have traded it for anything.  Plus
she figured it would be her only chance to watch Brooke that up close
and unguarded.</p>

<p>"I am a morning person, usually.  I was just disoriented is all,"
Brooke defended herself.  Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"OK, still I would like to recommend the decaf," Sam said as she
pushed herself into a sitting position.  "There are easier and safer
ways to exit a bed.  Standing for instance.  I won't be demonstrating
anytime soon but, I'm sure you're familiar with the concept."  Brooke
smiled and got up off the floor.</p>

<p>"Vaguely familiar, yes.  Hungry?" Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"I could eat," she answered.  &lt;Think good, clean, pure thoughts,
Sam.  Why is it everything I say has a double meaning lately?&gt; Brooke
brought the wheelchair over to the bed and Sam glared at it.  "I hate
that thing," she said, more to get her mind away from the drain it
seemed to circle all too often of late than to express her true
feeling towards the object.</p>

<p>"Just think, eventually it'll be a lawn ornament," Brooke suggested
cheekily.</p>

<p>"Kinda tacky, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Nah, I think it makes a statement."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah?  Like what? `Beware speeding Jaguars'?"</p>

<p>"Not funny," Brooke scolded as she helped Sam into the offending
object.</p>

<p>"OK, `Friends don't let friends get mowed down by expensive luxury
cars'?" Brooke moaned.</p>

<p>"Forget I said anything," she sighed.</p>

<p>"Sorry, it's just, you can either laugh or cry about the situation.
I hate crying so I chose to laugh.  So sue me."</p>

<p>"How much ya got?" Brooke challenged, desperate to get away from the
morose direction Sam was taking their conversation.</p>

<p>"My car, which is virtually useless to me right now, a half written
bio paper that I need to pass that class in order to be a senior in
the fall, a laptop and 52.36 in my banking account.  Why, got a hot
date and need my car and money tonight?"</p>

<p>"Only if you count a good friend, a rented DVD of `Sweet November'
and lots and lots of junk food a hot date," Brooke informed her.</p>

<p>"Really?  Who's coming over?" Sam asked.  Brooke rolled her eyes and
smacked Sam on the shoulder lightly.</p>

<p>"Very funny, I meant you, stupid."</p>

<p>"Oh," Sam said, genuinely confused.  "I thought Josh and Lily or
maybe Mary Cherry were coming over," she explained as they entered
the kitchen.  "Although I would question the use of `good friend'
and `Mary Cherry' in the same sentence." Brooke walked in front of
Sam to look at her.</p>

<p>"You're serious, aren't you?" Sam nodded.  "No, I meant you.  Why,
did you have plans?"</p>

<p>"Wallowing in self-pity was looking pretty promising, followed by a
quick bout of, `Oh God, why me?' but your plan sounds like more fun,"
Sam joked.  "You know you don't have to spend all your free time with
me, don't you?  I'm not exacty the queen of fun here."</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke started softly, "I want to spend my time with you."</p>

<p>"OK, I just don't want you to feel obligated or anything to spend
your time with me.  You've got friends and I know you haven't seen a
lot of them lately," Sam's voice was very quiet, like she was saying
good-bye to a good friend she was never going to see again.  Brooke
frowned.</p>

<p>"Sam, my best friend tried to run me over.  I'm apparently a bad
judge of character when it comes to chosing friends, a point you
tried to make clear fairly often a while ago.  Besides, I like
spending my time with you." Sam looked up.</p>

<p>"Really?" she asked hopefully. </p>

<p>"True if you'd asked me a year ago to write a list of the people I
would most like to spend my time with you would have been no where on
it but now, you are very near, if not on, the top of said list."</p>

<p>"You're just saying that to get my laptop, car and 52.36," Sam
accused playfully.</p>

<p>"Actually I wanted the half written bio paper, but I'll take the
52.36 nonetheless," Brooke laughed.  Sam stuck out her tongue and as
she saw Brooke open her mouth to comment, curled it up to touch the
end of her nose.  Brooke's mouth shut with an audible snap.  Hordes
of x-rated images concerning that tongue flooded Brooke's mind and
sent her into sensory overload.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh, I thought not," Sam commented saucily as Mike and Jane
walked into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Good morning girls, sleep well?" Mike asked as he opened the paper.
He missed the blush that spread across his daughter's face and the
barely hidden smirk on Sam's.</p>

<p>"Soundly," Sam said calmly.</p>

<p>"Yup," Brooke managed at the same time although her voice was
slightly higher pitched than normal.  She coughed to clear her throat
and smiled pleasantly (she hoped) at Jane.  "Morning Mom," she
greeted in a voice much more like her own.  Jane looked at the two
girls a moment and then nodded.</p>

<p>"Morning you two.  You weren't arguing were you?" she was answered by
two heads, one brunette and one blonde shaking vigorously.</p>

<p>"Nope," one said.</p>

<p>"Nu-uh," the other responded.  Sam crooked her finger for Brooke to
lean in closer.</p>

<p>"Don't ever play poker, Brooke," she whispered with a sly
smile.  "You'll lose."</p>

<p>"What do you two have planned for today?" Mike asked around the local
page.</p>

<p>"Well, Sam's got therapy at 11," Brooke started.</p>

<p>"Blech," Sam interjected as she put bread in the toaster.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you for that riviting editorial Debbie Matoanopolous,"
Brooke said sarcastically.  Sam's eyebrows rose.  &lt;You wanna play
that way? &gt;Her expression seemed to ask.  Brooke smiled at her
sweetly.  </p>

<p>"After that I thought we'd go shopping for school clothes," Brooke
finished, to the undying horror of Sam.  &lt;Shopping with Brooke?  Argh!
&gt;</p>

<p>"Now there's a frightening thought, Brooke.  I refuse play Teresa
doll to your Barbie," Sam complained.  Images of Brooke trying to
tress her in the newest Donna Karen and Versace fashions were
suddenly filling her head.  Not that she didn't like those clothes,
she just like her own style.  She thought Brooke had impecable taste
but wasn't sure if it suited her.</p>

<p>"You're not Teresa, Sam.  Lily would be a Teresa, you're more of a
Midge or Skipper," Sam glared at her murderously.  "Oh, hit a nerve
did I?  Come on, Sam, we both need new clothes for school."</p>

<p>"I know, I know but it's never been one of my things, clothes
shopping, I mean."</p>

<p>"She's telling the truth, Brooke.  Sam hates trying on clothes in
stores," Jane explained.</p>

<p>"Not to mention certain logistical problems," Sam pointed out while
motioning to the wheelchair.  Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"A minor problem, Sam.  Please, it's not like I haven't seen you
without any clothes on," Brooke heard the words and realized how they
sounded.  "No wait, getting dressed," she heard Sam's head connect
with the countertop hard and looked up to see her banging it
repeatedly.  Mike looked up from his paper confused and Jane looked
just plain disturbed. </p>

<p>"That came out wrong.  Sam, stop that before you hurt yourself.  I
just meant that I've been helping you get dressed since you woke up
from the coma and oh, never mind I have no reason to explain myself
to the three of you.  It was a totally innocent comment.  Dirty minds
people, dirty minds, shame on you." Sam was still banging her head.</p>

<p>"Sam," Jane scolded.  "Stop that please.  Brooke's right, I was just
startled.  Mike?"</p>

<p>"What?  I was just wondering if you read the paper.  It says they cut
a deal with Nicole and she's getting a walk," he said holding out the
paper for them to see.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke nearly screamed.  "Why didn't anyone call us?" she
grabbed the paper away from Mike roughly and started to read
outloud.  "`Nicole Julian, 17 was released from juvenile detention
yesterday after her lawyer successfully argued that her actions on
the night of the accident that nearly killed Samantha McPherson, 16,
were the result of a previously undiagnosed mental condition.'"  </p>

<p>"'Miss Julian suffers from Bi-Polar disorder and had been drinking on
the night in question.  The alcohol had effected her judgement when
she alledgedly tried to hit Brooke McQueen, 16, with her Jaguar.
McPherson is McQueen's stepsister and shoved McQueen out of the way
of the vehicle and was hit instead.  Julian is required, under the
terms of the release to: undergo an alcohol-drug treatment program,
serve 1700 hours of community service in a local hospital, have her
license revoked for 18 months and seek psychiatric treatment.  Both
the McQueen's and McPherson's were unavailable for comment at the
time of printing but the Julian's were reportedly happy with the
courts decision.'"</p>

<p>"That's," Jane started and stopped, speechless.</p>

<p>"Typical Nicole Julian," Sam finished apparently undisturbed by the
news.  "I wonder how much that cost the Julian family?"</p>

<p>"I can't believe this.  It's not fair," Brooke seethed.  Sam could
all but see the steam coming from Brooke's ears.</p>

<p>"I hate to say it, but I did tell you so," Sam said with a non-
commital shrug as she grabbed a glass and the orange juice.  Jane
gaped at her daughter.</p>

<p>"Aren't you the least bit angry?" Sam turned and took a deep breath.
She hadn't wanted to get into this but if they wanted the truth
they'd sure as Hell get it.
"No, frankly.  I wasn't going to say anything but what the Hell?  You
want to know what I am?  I am so far beyond angry that it doesn't
even appear on the same map as angry." She set down the glass with a
bang and turned to the other three people in the room.  They could
see the rage behind her eyes.</p>

<p>"This just goes to prove every single point I've ever made about the
rich and powerful having to answer to another set of rules than the
rest of the normal people.  If I did what Nicole did, I would be
looking at hard time but because of who she is, and who I am, that's
not the case.  Hell, even if she had hit Brooke she would have gotten
a stiffer sentence.  Because she's `Brooke McQueen'.  But I'm just
plain old `Sam McPherson', nothing big, no one important so who gives
a shit, right?  It's like Robert Downy Jr., the rules just don't
apply.  Am I angry?  No, I am enraged to the point that I can only
see red and I just want to rip her head off.  Happy?" Sam demanded.
Forgetting her toast and orange juice, Sam wheeled herself out of the
kitchen and back to her room.  </p>

<p>Mike, Jane and Brooke just sat in silence after Sam's little tirade.
None of them had been expecting such an explosion from Sam but they
knew they should have seen it coming.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Jane started but Brooke was already heading in Sam's
direction.</p>

<p>"All ready on it," Brooke called back.</p>

<p>
She found that Sam had somehow yet again managed to get to the floor
of her room and was curled into a ball crying.  The wheelchair was
lying on its side a few feet away.</p>

<p>"Sammy that can't be good for your back," Brooke said as she curled
up next to her.</p>

<p>"So?" Sam hiccuped.  "Who cares anyway?" Brooke wrapped an arm around
the crying girl.</p>

<p>"I do," she told her quietly.  "How do you keep getting down here?"</p>

<p>"I fell this time.  Very ungraceful of me, you'd have found it
humorous," Sam answered bitterly.  Brooke sighed.</p>

<p>"Do you really think that little of me that you think I'd laugh at
you after all this time?"</p>

<p>"I guess not," Sam responded honestly.  "I forget sometimes how
different you are."</p>

<p>"Than Nicole?"</p>

<p>"Than anybody.  Than how I thought you were.  Sorry."</p>

<p>"It's OK, I forget how different you are too.  Sam, what you said in
there, you're right and this is unfair but you are important.  You
are more than `plain old Sam McPherson'.  It's totally wrong that
Nic's walking away with a slap on the wrist and I agree with your
reasoning and I'm as pissed as Hell but, please, don't be so upset.
It's not you, it's the sucky system.  Even you have to admit that.
You complain about how unfair the system is all the time.  Truthfully
even if she had hit me chances are her family has enough money and
power that she still would have gotten away with it.  We both knew it
even if I didn't want to see it."</p>

<p>"When did things get so screwy?" Sam asked as she wiped her face.
Brooke reached up and covered Sam's hand with her own, holding it and
looking into Sam's eyes.  They were full of hurt and fear and Brooke
wanted nothing more than to hold Sam and kiss it all away.  But she
knew she couldn't.  So she stroked the side of Sam's face with her
hand instead and watched, slightly bewildered as Sam's eyes closed
and her body relaxed into the gentle touch.</p>

<p>"Sometime after birth, I think," Brooke suggested.  Sam nodded, eyes
still closed and still leaning into the warm hand on her face.  She
felt safe with Brooke there and hoped the girl didn't leave anytime
soon.  It seemed the only time she felt safe anymore was when Brooke
was nearby, it was like the blonde was her unknowing security
blanket.  Sam giggled a little at the thought causing Brooke to frown.</p>

<p>"What's so funny?" Sam shook her head.</p>

<p>"Nothing, just the look on Mom's face when you said you saw me with
no clothes on," she lied.  "She looked like she swallowed a
porcupine." Brooke joined her in laughing.</p>

<p>"Yeah, what did you tell me about poker?  Your banging your head on
the counter only made me look guiltier, you know." Sam laughed
outright at this.</p>

<p>"You should have seen your face!  `I don't need to explain myself to
you'.  It was priceless!" Brooke blushed although she had no idea why.</p>

<p>"Gee, thanks for the support.  Someone had to help you get dressed
all this time and Mom hasn't always been here.  Who'd they think was
helping?"</p>

<p>"Smurfs.  Anyway, speaking of which, do you really want to go
shopping later?" Sam asked, changing subjects and sitting up.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you do.  We really do need new clothes."</p>

<p>"I guess so, but please don't try and dress me like a mini you."
Brooke shuttered.</p>

<p>"Oh, scary thought," Brooke admitted.  "No, you can pick your own
clothes.  There's being sisterly and then there's being scary.
There's the line." She helped Sam off the floor again.  "You've got
to stop doing this, Sam.  The hardwood floor is no place for a lady."</p>

<p>"I'll be sure to tell one that when I see one," Sam joked, earning
herself a pinch on the arm.</p>

<p>"Har har.  There, all set?"</p>

<p>"Yup, getting to be a real Xena, I am."</p>

<p>"Ug, does that make me Gabrielle?" Brooke asked.  They simply stared
at each other for a second and let that analogy sink in. </p>

<p>"Nevermind," they said in unison.  Brooke pushed Sam back to the
kitchen where Jane and Mike waited worriedly.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, honey?" Jane asked.  Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"Honestly?  No, I'm not.  I want out of this chair and I want to beat
Nicole over the head with it.  But barring that, yeah, I'm fine.
Sorry about the little manic episode a few minutes ago, I'm gonna
blame it on my pain meds.  Or I would if I was still taking them."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, Sam," Mike assured her.  "It was totally
understandable.  We would have been more worried if you didn't react
to the news.  By the way, Carmen and Harrison have already called
about the article.  They're not happy either."</p>

<p>"I'd imagine not," Brooke added as she poured a glass of juice for
Sam and handed it to her.  "This is not going to go over well."  Sam
sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing we can do about it now, so let's just move
on," three sets of eyes stared at her in shock.  "What?"  Brooke put
her hand on Sam's forehead to check for a fever.</p>

<p>"You feel all right to me, how do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Knock it off, Princess, I'm fine.  I said we can't do anything right
now.  Give me time, I'll think of something," she said with a
devilish smile.  Brooke knew that look.  Sam was going to get Nicole
the one way she knew how.  In the school paper and it wasn't going to
be pretty.  Brooke returned the smile with just as much malice.</p>

<p>"Let me know if you need any help, Sam." Jane and Mike exchanged a
look of `Uh-oh' but wisely said nothing.  School was set to start in
a few weeks and things would play out then.</p>

<p>"Well, we have some good news, sort of, girls," Mike interjected.
Brooke and Sam looked up expectantly.  "Jane and I are going on a
short business trip to Utah for a few days, if you two think you can
handle things here yourselves."</p>

<p>"But only if you think you'll be all right," Jane reiterated.  Sam
rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Mom, I'm not an invalid and Brooke takes good care of me.  Go, have
fun, and don't worry about us.  Are you taking Mac?"  Jane nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, we figure taking care of you is enough responsibility for one
person," she joked.  Sam stuck out her tongue and frowned.</p>

<p>"Very funny, Mom," Sam snorted.  Truthfully she was a little nervous
about being alone with Brooke.  Some sort of line was crossed last
night and she knew there was no going back now.  There was something
brewing between her and Brooke and it scared her.  Her feelings for
Brooke were getting stronger and harder to hide and it wasn't helping
that the signals she was getting from Brooke were telling her that
her belief that Brooke was straight might have been incorrect.</p>

<p>&lt;Wouldn't that just be a kick in the pants?&gt; Sam asked herself.
&lt;Isn't there a provision in the Glamazon contract that says `Thou
shall be straight?' or something of the same?&gt;</p>

<p>"I thought it was, Sam," Brooke teased lightly.  "You're one Hell of
a handful when you wanna be."</p>

<p>"Great, now I'm getting flack from my Mom and my stepsister.
Anything you wanna add, Mike?" Sam asked sarcastically, pretending to
be offended.  Mike raised his hands in surrender.</p>

<p>"Not on your life.  I'll stay out of the line of fire, thank you," he
laughed.</p>

<p>"Chicken," Brooke criticized lightly.  "When do you leave?"</p>

<p>"Later this afternoon.  We'll be gone about a week, so behave
yourselves.  No wild parties, no bloodshed between the two of you,
although that seems unlikely now.  Have we mentioned how proud we are
that the two of you are getting along so well?" Mike asked.  Both
girls shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Well we are," Jane added.  "You've both matured a lot in a very
short period of time.  We're just sorry that it took something like
Nicole and the accident for you to put your differences aside." Sam
sighed.</p>

<p>"Look, can we just forget about Nicole and her little attempt at
thinning the population, please?  It's bad enough I'm reminded of it
every second of the day.  I'd really like to try and move on here." </p>

<p>"OK, Sammy, I'm sorry," Jane said, shrugging her confusion at Brooke
and Mike.</p>

<p>"Self-pity monster alert," Brooke spoke up.  Sam glared at
her.  "Well, it's true.  Go ahead and say it Sam, `woe is me'." Sam
raised an eyebrow and deepened the glare.</p>

<p>"Nah, you did it for me," she sighed again and her expression
softened.  "OK, banishing the pity beast.  Sorry, that whole Nic
thing really bothers me.  But go on your trip and have a good time.
I'm sure Brooke won't kill me while you're gone.  Well, as long as I
don't eat her cooking…"</p>

<p>"Hey!"</p>

<p>"Hee hee, gotcha." Jane hugged Sam as she went to finish packing.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your therapy appointment at 11,Sam," she turned to
Brooke.  "Keep an eye on one another and don't let her slack off just
because we're not here."  Brooke held up three fingers.</p>

<p>"Scouts honor," she promised.  Sam gaffawed.</p>
