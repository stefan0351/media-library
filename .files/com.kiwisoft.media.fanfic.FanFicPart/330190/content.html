<!-- Is That A Note In Your Pocket Or Are You Just Happy To See Me? -->


<p>Brooke yawned and pulled down the sheets on her bed.  After
all her birthday had gone amazingly well.  No one had killed Nicole,
not for lack of trying, mind you.  There was a slight incident
involving Harrison and a sharp kitchen instrument while she was
cutting the cake, but aside from that, no blood was shed.  And
watching Carmen nearly faint when Sam had calmly walked over to get a
soda from the fridge had been highly humourous.</p>

<p>&lt;Oh, Sam&gt; Brooke sighed silently.  With their parents home,
their hot and heavy relationship was slightly more subdued and quiet
and she found herself desperately missing the opportunity to hold and
caress the other girl late at night.  But given Jane's habit of
checking on Sam every once in a while, it led to incredibly awkward
and embarrassing situations.  Already they had to explain themselves
a few times with excuses such as nightmares and force of habit and
Brooke wasn't sure Jane was buying it anymore.</p>

<p>&lt;There's only so many times that the old I-had-a-nightmare-
about-the-accident-and-Brooke-came-running excuse is going to work&gt;
she lamented ruefully.  She smiled at the last time Jane came in and
found them curled up together in Sam's bed.  They had yet to go any
further than heavy petting, VERY heavy petting, but how Jane could
misconstrue the way they were laying there as anything less than what
it actually was was beyond Brooke.</p>

<p>&lt;Especially since Sam had fallen asleep with her hand up my
shirt&gt; she thought with a laugh.  She grabbed the excessively large
teddy bear Sam had given her earlier and climbed into bed.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a poor and overly furry substitute for my Sammy-
bear {apologies to the originator of the nickname}, but you'll have
to do," she sighed as she hugged it closer.  She was about to drift
asleep when her hand brushed against something that crinkled.
Shaking the sleep from her brain, she sat up, turned on the light and
took a closer look at the bear.  Under the bright red ribbon around
its neck was a neatly folded piece of paper she had missed earlier.</p>

<p>&lt;What the Heck?&gt; she shrugged as she pulled it out.  On the
front, in Sam's distinctive scrawl was Brooke's name.  Fully awake
now and wondering what Sam could have possibly written to her, Brooke
carefully unfolded the treasure.</p>

<p>It took a few minutes for her eyes to adjust to the light and
to focus on the words but as she read, they filled with tears and it
took several tries to read the entire piece all the way through.
When she was finished she sat there stunned beyond words, unable to
move.  She replayed the beautiful, sincere and loving prose over and
over in her mind as she clutched the paper to her chest.</p>

<p>What You Are to Me<br>
By: Samantha McPherson</p>

<p>The oceans are just water,<br>
Moisture at my feet.<br>
The mountains are just dirt<br>
Where the ground and sky meet.</p>

<p>Thunder is just a sound<br>
A symphony to my ears.<br>
Tears are just a relief<br>
And release from my fears.</p>

<p>But it's all a drop of water,<br>
A pebble in my shoe.<br>
Small, insignificant and petty<br>
When compared to my love for you.</p>

<p>You are the sun in my sky,<br>
My North, South, East, and West.<br>
You are what makes my world turn<br>
And my heart beat within my chest.</p>

<p>You make my life worth living<br>
You help me face each day.<br>
Without you in my life<br>
My soul would wither away.</p>

<p>You are my passion,<br>
My spirit, my soul, my fire.<br>
And without ever saying a word<br>
You fulfill every desire.</p>

<p>So even without the moon<br>
To chase the sun across the sky<br>
Even without a tear in Heaven<br>
Left for me to cry<br>
I would find a way to tell you<br>
I would find a way to let you know<br>
That there is nothing<br>
In Heaven or Hell<br>
That will ever make me let you go</p>

<p>The simple words are I love you<br>
Body, Soul, Heart, and Mind<br>
Nothing will ever change that<br>
Until the end of time.</p>

<p>I love you Brooke<br>
Happy Birthday</p>

<p>Sam</p>

<p>A sob escaped Brooke, as the depth of Sam's love for her was
layed out before her in plain black and white.  Sam was always good
with the written word but she sometimes lacked in the spoken.  Brooke
never doubted how Sam really felt; she never had reason to even if
the words were hard for Sam to sometimes say.  But here, on this
piece of college ruled paper and with the magic of a black ballpoint
pen, Sam had erased any future doubt or fear Brooke may have ever
suffered from.  This little white sheet of paper contained a piece of
Sam McPherson's soul, and Brooke was never going to let it go.</p>

<p>She got up and walked on unsteady legs through their shared
bathroom into Sam's room.  There, sprawled out asleep was Sam,
oblivious to the emotional wreck Brooke now was.  She was on her
side, her back to Brooke with one arm up over her head and her covers
half on and half off.  Brooke stood in the doorway watching her for a
few long minutes crying quietly.  All the gifts in the world, all the
money in the universe couldn't hold a candle to the little piece of
parchment in her hand.</p>

<p>Gathering her composure and desperately needing to talk to
and hear Sam's voice, Brooke walked over to the sleeping girl and sat
on the bed.  Sam didn't stir.  Sometimes Brooke swore a freight train
could go throught the house and Sam would sleep though it.  She
reached over and gently shook the slumbering form.</p>

<p>"Sam," she whispered, her voice still thick with unshed
tears.  "Sammy, wake up." Sam mumbled something incoherent and,
Brooke guessed, vaguely rude but not personal and went back to
sleep.  Brooke sighed.</p>

<p>"Sam, wake up," she said louder this time, but still gently.
Sam rolled over but didn't open her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don' wan' go skoo, Ma," Sam whined with a frown and still
not awake.  Brooke thought she was adorable half asleep and
incoherant.  But then, she always thought Sam was adorable.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke kissed her lightly on the lips, making Sam's
eyes snap open.  </p>

<p>"OK, not Mom," Sam said, almost fully awake.  She blinked at
Brooke's tear streaked face confused and worried.  "What's wrong?
Nightmare again?" Brooke smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, definitely not a nightmare.  This," she said as she held
up the paper.  Sam stared at it a minute before recognition dawned on
her still fuzzy with sleep brain and she blushed.</p>

<p>"Found that, did ya?" Brooke nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, just as I fell asleep.  It's very beautiful.  Thank
you," Sam looked away embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it," she whispered.  Brooke leaned in and
gave her a more impassioned kiss.</p>

<p>"I more than `liked' it, Sammy," she explained when they
parted.  "I loved it.  Did you really mean it?  Is that how you
really feel?"  Sam stared at her incredulously.

	"Of course it is," she said enthusiastically.  "I wouldn't
have written it otherwise.  How could you think I didn't mean it?"
Sam sounded hurt, which wasn't Brooke's intention.</p>

<p>"Whoa, back up the truck a minute," Brooke hastily tried to
explain herself.  "I didn't mean that I didn't believe you, Sam.  I
do, oh God, I hope you love me that much."</p>

<p>"I do," Sam said emphatically cutting Brooke off.  Brooke
kissed her again.</p>

<p>"I know.  I was just saying that seeing it written down like
that made it so tangible, so real.  These words come directly from
your soul, Sam.  And that is special." Sam blushed.</p>

<p>"I wanted you to know how I felt.  And I'm a writer so; I
wrote it down for you.  I'm really glad you like it." Sam wrapped her
arms around Brooke and sighed a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"What was that for?" Brooke asked as she relaxed into Sam's
embrace.  She felt Sam chuckle.</p>

<p>"I, uh, thought you found it earlier and hated it.  You never
said anything about it so I figured you were waiting to tell me how
horrible and corny it was when we were alone.  I'm REALLY relieved."
Now Brooke laughed.</p>

<p>"That's why you arranged it so we were never in the room
alone at anytime all night, isn't it?" she felt Sam nod.</p>

<p>"I really didn't need the blow to my ego about my writing
tonight, Brooke," she laughed although Brooke could hear the truth
behind the statement.</p>

<p>"Sam, anything that comes from the heart could never be
horrible or corny.  As long as it's sincere, someone's bound to like
it." </p>

<p>"I don't care about someone, love, just as long as you did,"
Sam admitted.  Brooke smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, feel free to write me poetry anytime you like.  I'm
sure I'll love it," she proclaimed.  Sam scoffed.</p>

<p>"I'll remember that at Christmas when you have your heart set
on a Gucci handbag and I'm low on cash, Princess," she chided.  "You
heading back to your room soon?" she asked a hint of disappointment
creeping into her voice.  Brooke shook her head.</p>

<p>"Nah, thought I'd stay here awhile," Brooke answered as she
cuddled further into Sam's arms and under the blankets.  Sam made no
attempt to stop her.</p>

<p>"What about Mom?" </p>

<p>"I locked the doors, she'll have to knock first.  Besides,
it's my birthday and I'll sleep where I want to." Sam hugged her
closer and kissed her ear.</p>

<p>"Happy birthday, Brooke.  I'm glad you like your present,"
Sam whispered as she settled in to go to sleep.</p>

<p>"You're the best present I could have asked for, Sam.
Honest."</p>
