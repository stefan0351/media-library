<!-- Gremlins \ Part Four -->

<p>Gabrielle stood and grabbed Xena by the forearms
as she stood over the body of the now gasping Joxer. &quot;Xena take it off! You&#146;re
going to kill him! Take it off!&quot; </p>

<p>Reluctantly Xena reached over and released the
pinch and Joxer began breathing again and the color began returning to his face. Gabrielle
knelt down and helped him up as Xena just turned from the table and stalked up the steps.</p>

<p>&quot;I tried to tell you! I warned you, but you
wouldn&#146;t listen. Crimeiny Joxer you can be so dense sometimes.&quot; She chastised
him as she pulled him off the floor. She sat him back down in a chair and handed him a
mug.</p>

<p>&quot;What happened?&quot; He gasped as he took a
drink of his ale.</p>

<p>&quot;You got pinched.&quot; Gabrielle growled at
him as she picked up her scroll bag and slung it over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw now why&#146;d she go and do that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you never know when to shut up. Now
just enjoy your ale, I&#146;m going to check on Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh sure, she nearly kills me and you go off
to make sure she&#146;s okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer I swear by the Gods you are the most
frustrating person I&#146;ve ever met. You irritate her and then you seemed surprised when
she retaliates. You&#146;re lucky she didn&#146;t kill you. She&#146;s had a really hard
day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everyday is a hard day for a warrior.&quot;
He said with a proud arrogance as she turned and walked away. She just shook her head as
she climbed the stairs towards their room. As she approached the door of their room she
sighed as she pushed it open. Xena was lying on the bed with a cloth over her eyes. She
didn&#146;t even look at Gabrielle as she entered the room and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;I shouldn&#146;t have gotten up
today.&quot; Xena mumbled. &quot;I should have just stayed in our bedroll.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well if you remember right that&#146;s were
all this kinda started.&quot; Gabrielle said as she rubbed Xena&#146;s hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; She mumbled in agreement.
&quot;Whadya&#146; do with Joxer the Mouthy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I left him to his own devices
downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m not paying for the damage when
somebody uses him for target practice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh don&#146;t worry about that. There
won&#146;t be much damage, he&#146;s to daft to duck.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior chuckled. Gabrielle snickered at the
thought. She liked Joxer she really did but sometimes he could just be so damned annoying.
Today was one of those days. &quot;Can I get you anything?&quot; She asked Xena.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually I need some Alser root to bring
the swelling down in my face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do we have any?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope. Don&#146;t suppose I could talk you
into going and getting some could I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or course you can. I&#146;ll go now and be
back soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take your time Gabrielle. I&#146;m going to
take a nap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re going to&#133;take a nap?&quot;
Gabrielle said, the surprise clear in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh. I&#146;m going to take a nap. You
got a problem with that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no. I&#146;ve just never known you to do
that before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There&#146;s a first time for everything.
We&#146;re here to rest and that&#146;s what I&#146;m going to do. I&#146;ve earned it
today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes you have. You rest and I&#146;ll
be back in a bit. Do you need anything else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope just the root.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Gabrielle leaned over and
placed a soft kiss on Xena&#146;s cheek. The warrior smiled and lifted the cloth with one
hand. She peaked out from under it.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Love you too.&quot; She stood up and
crossed the room to the saddlebags. She took the small bag that contained their dinars and
put it in her scroll bag. It was then she realized long ears was missing. &quot;Oh great
Zeus&#133;&quot; She groaned as she dug through the bag.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#146;s wrong Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh nothing the um&#133;tip&#133;yeah
that&#146;s it&#133;the tip broke off my quill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well get another one while you&#146;re
out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll do that. Back soon.&quot;
Gabrielle dashed out the door and down the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p>

<p>When she got to the common room Joxer was still
at the table. Gabrielle went back to the table and began looking all over for the long
eared little monster. She searched all over the floor near the table, under the chairs and
the immediate area. Joxer watched her with some amusement.</p>

<p>&quot;Lose something?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh.&quot; She said as she continued her
search.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look you just told me you lost something.
Now if you&#146;d just tell me what, I could help you look for it.&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped and considered his words for a
minute. Then she shook her head to clear her mind for even considering the possibility.
&quot;I&#146;ll find it don&#146;t worry.&quot; Just as these words tumbled from her mouth
she saw him sitting contentedly between Joxer&#146;s boots. He was sipping ale from his
hands that had spilled to the floor and pooled into a puddle by the toes of Joxer&#146;s
boots.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh well that&#146;s disgusting.&quot; She
murmured as she snatched him up. She took a moment to examine him before standing up. He
didn&#146;t look and worse for the wear he was just hammered. He smiled up at her and
hiccuped again. She didn&#146;t notice when Joxer peeked under the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Watchya got there Gabby?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle jerked up and hit her head on the
underside of the table. Rubbing her head as she slowly rose on her knees to look at Joxer.
&quot;Can you see it too?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What, the little bat looking thingy? Yeah
it&#146;s right there, in your hand.&quot; He pointed to a hiccuping Long ears. </p>

<p>&quot;Well if Argo&#146;s smart enough to see
him, I suppose Joxer could be.&quot; She mumbled to herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Whaddya say? </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m not sure, but I may have just
insulted myself.&quot; She said as she pulled herself up and sat in a chair putting long
ears on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey he&#146;s kinda cute. Can I pet
him?&quot; He asked as he reached out.</p>

<p>&quot;Um I don&#146;t know&#133;&quot; She said
as she heard a little growl come from long ears.</p>

<p>Joxer jerked his hand back as long ears gnashed
his sharp little teeth in the direction of Joxer&#146;s extended finger. &quot;Geeze
Gabrielle put a muzzle on that thing will ya&#146;, it&#146;s vicious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer it&#146;s smaller than your finger.
How much damage could he do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t want to know. Has Xena seen it
yet?&quot; He asked still keeping his hand close to his chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Well not exactly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keeping it a secret? Good idea. Somehow I
don&#146;t think she&#146;d be real happy with it. Especially if it tried to bite her.
She&#146;d just <b>smush</B> it into the table.&quot; The last part of his comment was
directed at long ears who just finally passed out and fell over into a little lump on the
table.</p>

<p>Gabrielle rolled him over and peered at his
little body. &quot;Well he&#146;s still breathing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can you tell?&quot; He asked as he
lowered his face and eyes to the table level as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at his little chest going up and
down.&quot; She pointed at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah I see it now.&quot;</p>

<p>They were so engrossed in watching him breath
they didn&#146;t notice the innkeeper who had been standing there long enough to think
there was something wrong with both of them. &quot;Something wrong with my table?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked up and smiled at him as she
smoothed her hands over the wood of the table. &quot;No, no it&#146;s a very nice table
actually. One of the nicest I&#146;ve ever seen. Don&#146;t you think so Joxer.&quot;</p>

<p>Joxer still wasn&#146;t paying attention and it
earned him a kick in the shin. &quot;Isn&#146;t this one of the nicest tables you&#146;ve
ever seen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Owww! Yeah, yeah it&#146;s a great
table!&quot; He said quite annoyed as he rubbed his leg.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh.&quot; The innkeeper groused as he
collected up the empties from the table. &quot;Will you two be needing anything else?
Maybe if you have one more you&#146;ll be appreciating the floor too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No thanks. We&#146;ve got some things to
do.&quot; Gabrielle said as she swept long ears up into her hand and stood up. &quot;Come
on Joxer I&#146;ve got to get some things at the market.&quot; She put the little drunk in
her scroll bag and grabbed Joxer by the arm dragging him out of the inn.</p>

<p>As they walked toward the market, Joxer reached
over and peeked under the flap of Gabrielle&#146;s bag. &quot;You know it was almost as if
that innkeeper couldn&#146;t see it.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle slapped his hands away form the bag.
&quot;He couldn&#146;t, &quot;She paused &quot;and neither can Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why can we see it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s a him not an it and I&#146;m not
sure. I guess I can see him because I believe in him, but that doesn&#146;t explain why
you can see him since you don&#146;t even know what he is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I suppose you do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah he&#146;s a gremlin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A gremlin? Oh boy you&#146;ve lost it. You
know kinda like Xena when she said the day kept repeating over and over and over
and&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah I was there remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey you know she never did say if that was
a hickey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer drop the hickey thing okay. You
really don&#146;t want to know.&quot; She smiled as she stopped at the vendor who would
have the root Xena needed.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; He asked with that certain whine
in his voice that sent chills down her spine.</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer look you couldn&#146;t handle it,
okay. Just drop it.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle was grateful when the vendor stepped
forward. Hopefully by the time she was finished Joxer would be ready to drop the hickey
subject.. &quot;Yes Miss can I help you?&quot; The aged man asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m looking for Alser root.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ve got some very nice Alser root let
me find one for you.&quot; The old man began digging in a pile of roots. Gabrielle took
the opportunity to look around the rest of the market. She wanted to find something
special for Xena to apologize for the lousy day that she had been subjected to as a result
of her new little friend.</p>

<p>Joxer eyed the flap of Gabrielle&#146;s bag, it
began to rustle. He tugged on her sleeve. &quot;Ah Gabby.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not now Joxer.&quot; She never looked at
him, she continued to look at the various shops.</p>

<p>He watched as the drunk little thingy began to
crawl out of the scroll bag. &quot;Ah Gabby you really&#133;&quot; He tugged on her shirt
again. She whirled around to face him. Placing her staff squarely at the end of his nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer I swear if you don&#146;t stop that
I&#146;m gonna break your nose. I&#146;ve gotten a lot of experience in that
recently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But your little&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>He was cut off by the return of the vendor.
&quot;Here you go Miss. One fresh Alser root. Would you like me to prepare it into a
powder for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How about preparing half of it into a
powder and leaving the other half whole. I&#146;m buying it for a friend and I don&#146;t
know exactly what she has in mind.&quot; </p>

<p>Joxer watched as long ears fell out of
Gabrielle&#146;s bag and dropped to the ground. He followed as the little critter
staggered into the busy market. </p>

<p>&quot;Most people use it in a powder in a
poultice for taking swelling down.&quot; The vendor continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah that&#146;s the plan, but go ahead and
leave half of it whole. She has some very unusual methods.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you wish.&quot; The vendor disappeared
with the root. </p>

<p>Gabrielle turned to talk with Joxer. &quot;Now
what did you&#133;&quot; She just shook her head when she realized he was gone. &quot;I
swear by Zeus&#133;&quot; She mumbled. She opened her scroll bag when the merchant
returned and retrieved her dinars. She paid him and took her package. She placed both
items back in the bag never noticing that one thing was missing.</p>

<p>She looked again for Joxer. She breathed a sigh
of relief when she realized he had wandered off. She just hoped for his sake, he had
brains enough not to go back to the inn to try and cheer Xena up.</p>

<p>She continued through the market place shopping
at various booths trying to find something for Xena. A new knife? No, she already had so
many of those; she was a walking weapons shop. Jewelry wasn&#146;t her style. The bard
knew full well to not even attempt an armor purchase. She fingered her staff as she
continued walking.</p>

<p>The crashing sound behind her caused her to spin,
staff in defensive mode. She watched in horror as Joxer crawled on his hands and knees
through the market knocking over tables, baskets, breaking pottery and just generally
making a mess of things.</p>

<p>&quot;Come here you little&#133;&quot; He yelled
as he lunged and sent a succession of tables crashing over.</p>

<p>Very soon the entire market was in an uproar.
Patrons and vendors alike all trying to grab a flailing Joxer, who managed to escape every
pair of hands that grabbed for him as he continued to scramble through the market.</p>

<p>Gabrielle began digging into her scroll bag.
&quot;Oh no!&quot; The realization hit her like a landslide. &quot;Damn, damn, damn!&quot;
She groaned as she ran into the commotion. By the time the trail of angry vendors ended
Gabrielle saw Joxer being held by two of the city guards.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw Zeus&#146; boots.&quot; She mumbled as
she watched them cart him off. &quot;Great, just furkin&#146; great!&quot;</p>

<p>She quickly scanned the market for any signs of
long ears. She found him at last, sitting on top of an overturned basket of fruit munching
on a cherry. She retrieved him and held him up to her face. &quot;You&#146;re beginning to
be more trouble than you&#146;re worth. If you don&#146;t behave I&#146;m going to feed
you to Xena. She likes Gremlin on a stick.&quot;</p>

<p>He dropped his ears back and let the cherry fall
from his hands. &quot;Gleep!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So behave or you&#146;re dinner
buddy!&quot; She growled.</p>

<p>He nodded and she put him back in her scroll bag
and headed for the city jail.</p>
