<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 25 -->

<p>B'Elanna's spirits had been buoyed after she received Annika's letter, and she always carried the oft-read missage inside of her shirt, next to her heart.  It felt almost as if she had a piece of Annika with her now, and she was comforted by that feeling.  Harry too had received a letter back from Sarah and while it did cheer him up it also served to make him long more keenly for home than ever before.  Rumours flew among the soldiers daily that the peace talks were close to being finished, but still they marched into battle and more men died while royalty on either side talked.  B'Elanna long ago ceased to lend any credence to the rumours she heard that the war was nearly over.</p>
<p>As time passed B'Elanna's reputation as a superiour soldier and leader grew steadily.  Her first command had been of a regiment that was positioned at the very fringes of the battlefield, but as time passed she was moved further and further toward the centre of the action, until only Gloucester's regiment was between her and the King at the very heart of the battalion.  Once again she found herself comforted by Gloucester's presence near her in battle.  The size of the army had shrunk considerably, but new soldiers were constantly arriving from England.  B'Elanna spent time with each new knight that joined her regiment and her men would gladly have followed her through the gates of hell if she had asked.  They saw that she was a gifted soldier, and an inspiring leader, but more than that they saw in her a compassion that was missing from so many great leaders and they loved her for it.</p>
<p>The army had been camped for several weeks outside of the fallen city of Rouen while the King attended talks with the French Dauphin in the nearby city of Troyes.  The men were growing restless, hoping to either return to battle or to their homes.  Sitting idly by did not sit well with men who had spent a year in constant action. The King returned several days later but not one word was spoken of what had transpired during the talks.  However the army was given orders to break camp and prepare to march the following day, so B'Elanna assumed that once again the talks had been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Another month passed in which England's army began to gain ground against the French with greater rapidity.  The fall of Rouen had cut the heart out of the French army and they fell back against the English tide.  Burgundy was almost entirely in English hands and the mood among the soldiers was good; spirits were high, as they could not imagine the French holding out much longer against their constant assault.  The two sides had been clashing for days over a key piece of ground outside of Troyes.  The French appeared to have found some measure of resistance yet and the battle was hotly contested.</p>
<p>B'Elanna found herself once again unhorsed by the French hordes, and she had been battling for what seemed like hours against a seemingly endless stream of French swordsman.  The English were pushing forward slowly and it seemed that the field might finally fall to the English.  The apparent success spurred the English on to greater efforts and soon the armies were scattered and fighting minor skirmishes all over the field of battle.  There was a lull in the fighting near B'Elanna and she took a moment to view the battleground and assess the situation.  She saw the banner of the King nearby on her left and even as she gazed on it she saw to her horror that it was beset on all sides by the enemy.  The King and his footmen had become isolated when the troops broke rank and charged forward.  A small contingent of the French had seen this and taken advantage of the situation.  As B'Elanna started toward the King's location she watched in disbelief as the banner fell; this could only mean one thing and fear lent wings to B'Elanna's feet as she ran toward her fallen leader.</p>
<p>There were at least five French soldiers surrounding King Henry and all of his guards had been killed in the battle to protect him.  B'Elanna cursed herself for not paying more attention; she could have prevented this if only she had been watching out for her leader. She cut down two of the enemy swiftly from behind as soon as she arrived on the scene.  She saw to her horror that the King was lying helpless on the ground at the feet of one of the French swordsmen.  Without thinking she launched herself bodily at the man before he could bring his upraised sword down on the head of the fallen King.  She rode the man's body down to the ground and leapt to her feet as quickly as she could given the encumbrance of her armour.  She dispatched her opponent while he struggled to regain his feet and then turned with a snarl to impose her body between the King and the two remaining soldiers.  She fought like one of the mythical furies and took the life of the fourth soldier in short order, all the while defending herself against the attack of both enemies.  The fifth man turned and fled before the body of his companion even hit the ground.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna leapt to the King's side; seeing with relief that he was moving slowly in an attempt to stand.  She offered him her hand and pulled him to his feet.  </p>
<p>"Are you injured you Majesty?" She inquired worriedly.</p>
<p>"Not nearly so gravely as I would have been had you not come to my defense Lord Beyla," he said, retaining a sense of humour even in situations like this.</p>
<p>B'Elanna quickly found his sword and handed it to him before she knelt down beside the standard bearer and took the King's banner from his lifeless hands.  She hoisted the banner aloft and saw to her relief that Gloucester and several of his men were moving toward their position.  The small group came together as a fighting force and B'Elanna handed the banner off to one of the younger soldiers so that she would be free to fight.  The King ordered the rally to be sounded and soon the English regrouped and as a unified force finally pushed the French back until they laid down their arms and surrendered the field.</p>
<p>The King took Gloucester and several other of the royals closest to the throne and left to speak to the Dauphin who had also been injured on the field that day.  B'Elanna walked slowly back over the field toward their tent lines, stopping to render assistance to the fallen where she could.  It was some time before she made it back to her tent, and even longer before Harry made his weary way back to their temporary home.</p>
<p>"You look like Hell I don't mind saying," he joked as he saw her filthy, blood-soaked figure sitting exhausted in one of the chairs they had managed to obtain.</p>
<p>"You haven't even gotten all of your armour off yet."</p>
<p>"I'm so tired I can barely move Harry.  Do you remember a time when I used to run and lift heavy objects just for the fun of it?  What was that?about a thousand years ago?"  She was joking but Harry could hear the exhaustion in her voice.</p>
<p>"Let me help you out of those filthy clothes and I'll fetch some water so you can bathe properly before we eat.  I think I even know where you have a suit of clean clothes."  </p>
<p>"That sounds like heaven indeed," she replied, struggling to her feet so that Harry could remove the last of her armour and unwind the bindings from around her chest.</p>
<p>Harry had just removed the last of the bindings, telling B'Elanna he would boil them thoroughly before she put them back on.  B'Elanna was standing stripped to the waist in the middle of their tent when the flap was pulled quickly back and Gloucester, the King, and one of his squires entered the tent.  It took a moment for his eyes to register and interpret what he was seeing, but when he did his jaw fell open slackly.  No one moved for what seemed like an eternity and then B'Elanna grabbed at the cloth in Harry's hands to cover herself.</p>
<p>"Don't move," the King barked. He turned to his squire.</p>
<p>"Leave us."</p>
<p>The squire made a hasty retreat and now Harry and B'Elanna were alone in the tent with Gloucester and the King.  The King walked in a full circle around B'Elanna and Harry, never taking his eyes off of her.  Gloucester stood silently by the entrance to the tent with his eyes downcast.</p>
<p>"This cannot be.  My eyes deceive me. I've seen you in the lists and on the battlefield and you are no woman."  </p>
<p>Suddenly the King recalled himself with a start and motioned that B'Elanna should cover herself.  She quickly picked up her discarded tunic and pulled it over her head.  Still the King stared at her, shaking his head in disbelief.</p>
<p>"What witchcraft is this?" He wondered aloud. "Do you know the punishment for impersonating a member of the nobility?not to mention the other?matter," he finished lamely.</p>
<p>Harry had been standing at the back of the tent almost forgotten, but now he thrust himself bodily between B'Elanna and the King.</p>
<p>"I give my life in her stead Your Majesty," he cried.  "I bear the lion's share of blame in this.  I should have known better; she did all of this for me."</p>
<p>"And just who are you that you should know better than her?"</p>
<p>"I am Lord Harry Kim, the son and rightful heir of Lord Stanley Kim who fell in your service at Agincourt, along with his man at arms, her father, Jonathon Torrance."</p>
<p>Whatever the King had been expecting Harry to say it certainly hadn't been that.  He was clearly taken aback by the young healer's admission. He remembered the two men in question very well.  He had considered Lord Kim a friend, and knew the Lord had felt the same way about his squire Torrance.  The two had died protecting one another not far from his position on the battlefield and he had mourned their loss.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you'd better explain just exactly what went on," he demanded.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna began to speak, but Harry motioned her to be silent and he once again repeated the tale of the peasant uprising that had taken his mother from him.  He described how only B'Elanna's quick and unselfish intervention had saved his life, and how she had assumed the identity of a nobleman in order to provide a living for the both of them.  When the story was over the King remained silent for some time as he absorbed all he had heard.</p>
<p>"You are married are you not Lord Beyla," he inquired, "Is your?wife aware of your deception?"</p>
<p>"Leave Annika out of this I beg you," B'Elanna cried, "she is blameless in all of this."</p>
<p>"It was only a question. I intend her no harm."</p>
<p>B'Elanna's mind was racing as she realized that she may never see Annika or England again.  She knew the King valued right and honour above all; he had hung the friends of his youth for disobeying his orders, and she knew that he had also put to death Cambridge, Masham, and Northumberland for conspiring against him.  She could only imagine what her fate might be now that he deception was revealed in its entirety.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, she has saved my life on countless occasions on the battlefield, and I might respectfully remind you that she saved yours not four hours ago," Gloucester spoke quietly from the front of the tent.  He too was a man of honour and though he couldn't comprehend how B'Elanna had come to fool them all so thoroughly it didn't sit right with him that she might be harmed in any way.  "If need be I will offer my life in exchange for hers," he finished.</p>
<p>"I hardly think it will come to that John," the King spoke at last.</p>
<p>"I knew your father well Lord Kim, and yours as well," he said indicating B'Elanna.  "They were both brave and honourable men.  I did not know that you were still alive, I was told that the peasants had slaughtered you along with your mother.  Lord Rhys assured me that he buried you himself."</p>
<p>The King was not a foolish man and he knew immediately why Rhys had wanted him to believe that Stanley Kim's rightful heir was dead.  He would deal with Rhys in his own way later.</p>
<p>"I can hardly have you pretending to be a Lord under my command.  It wouldn't be seemly for me to condone forgery and the impersonation of nobility."  </p>
<p>B'Elanna's heart was in her throat as she heard these words.  She was about to lose it all.  The King drew his sword, holding up his hand to forestall the arguments he knew were coming from both Kim and Gloucester.  He had to make this right?honour demanded it.  He reached out and pushed B'Elanna to her knees.  Her thoughts were of Annika as she waited for her fate to be decided.  The King stepped back and took his sword in both hands, raising it over B'Elanna's head; his hand trembled with the enormity of what he was about to do, but he could see no other way to put the situation right.  </p>
<p>He looked down on the person to whom he owed his life; quickly he touched the blade on either shoulder, knighting her properly and legally.  He gave her her nobility, and with it he gave her back her name, as she would henceforth be known as Lord Beyla Torrance.  As to the matter of her sex the King could do nothing to change that, but he knew a warrior when he saw one, and he trusted his life to the warrior before him now.  He sent Gloucester out to ensure that the squire who had witnessed the event would keep his mouth shut about it by order of his king.  He also informed Harry that would be henceforth be known by his proper title.  He didn't need to admonish either of them to keep these things a secret.  He then took his leave of them to go and inform his scribe that some new and proper letters of nobility would be required.</p>
<p>He was halfway back to his own tent when he realized that he had forgotten to tell Harry and Beyla the real reason behind his visit to their tent.  Not wishing a repeat of the first visit he decided to clean himself up and have his wounds looked at before he returned to their quarters.  Even so he told himself he would announce his presence clearly before he ever entered their tent again.</p>
<p>Several hours later the King was cleaned up and freshly bandaged.  He could face legions of enemies on the battlefield but he found himself nervous at the thought of interacting with Beyla alone and so he found John Gloucester and asked that he accompany him to the tent of the two Lords.  He wanted to impart his news in person as well as offer Beyla a much overdue debt of gratitude for saving his life.  He held in his hands two freshly completed scrolls, as well as one much older and well-worn vellum.  When they arrived at the tent, he cleared his throat and called out; he shifted nervously from foot to foot as he waited to be granted entrance to the living quarters of the female warrior. Gloucester sensed his nervousness and had to fight back a grin at the sight of the King of England waiting to be granted entrance to the tent of someone who until very recently had been a peasant girl.</p>
<p>Harry drew back the tent flap and bowed low as the King entered the tent.  B'Elanna also swept a low bow before her sovereign.  The King wasted no time in presenting his gifts to the two young people.  He had made up some of the history on Lord Beyla's papers himself, and he was quite proud of the job he had done.  He had also had the scribe prepare letters of nobility for Harry, as he assumed, quite correctly that Harry's actual papers were lost in the fire of his family home.  The older scroll he also handed to Harry, who had tears in his eyes when he realized that they were his father's papers that the King had kept upon his friend's death.  Harry had never been particularly close to his father, but he still valued this tie to his past, and it meant a great deal to him when the King assured him that his father would have been very proud of the way his son had grown to be such a fine man.</p>
<p>It was then that the King imparted his biggest news.  He had finally managed to conclude talks with the Dauphin of France.  The war was indeed coming to an end and soon they would all be back in England.  There was however one obstacle in the way of signing the treaty.  He needed to persuade the sister of the Dauphin, Catherine de Valois, that she should marry him in order to cement the bonds between the countries and establish his right to ascend the throne of France.  </p>
<p>"The problem is," the King explained, "I know nothing of women, or of romance.  I am unafraid of facing death on the battlefield, but the thought of being alone in a room with this woman and having a conversation terrifies me beyond reason.  Yet I can hardly allow my country to remain at war because her King lacks the wit to woo a woman."  The look of abject terror on the face of the young King was absolutely hysterical, and it was all Harry and B'Elanna could do not to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>"It would seem Your Majesty," Gloucester spoke, "that Lord Beyla could perhaps be of some assistance in this matter.  HE is after all somewhat of an expert in the area of women."</p>
<p>Now it was B'Elanna's turn to look frightened.</p>
<p>"Gloucester speaks the truth, you are married after all.  How did you persuade your wife to marry you?"</p>
<p>"I believe that Annika loves me in spite of myself," she replied with a smile.  "She also loves me despite all of the obstacles that stood in our way.  I've never met a woman as brave or as true as my Annika."</p>
<p>"But how did you woo her?how did you persuade her to love you?" The King asked earnestly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled as she warmed to her favourite topic.  She told of meeting Annika for the first time, and how much Annika appreciated and was drawn to the fact the she actually listened to her words and thoughts; that she treated her like a human being, not an objet d'art.  Soon everyone present was chiming in with advice and telling stories of their own experiences with romance.  Several hours passed before they knew it and the King was surprised to find that he had actually enjoyed himself.  He had agreed to let Beyla live and to grant her letters of nobility out of a sense of duty and honour to one to whom he owed his life.  Now, however, he found that he actually liked this woman and enjoyed spending time in her company.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you and Harry would come with me to Troyes where I'm to meet Catherine," he inquired, not wanting to make it an order.</p>
<p>"If you think it will help bring an end to this war we will accompany you to the gates of hell and back Your Majesty," Harry replied fervently.</p>
<p>"There is one other thing," the King spoke hesitantly, "There is to be a banquet in honour of Catherine and myself at Troyes."</p>
<p>They waited patiently to see what it was the King was asking of them now.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose either one of you knows how to dance?" He asked in a sheepish tone.</p>
<p>Harry almost fell of his chair he laughed so loudly at the King's innocent question.  The King looked askance as his hysterical friends.  When Harry finally calmed down enough to draw breath, he told the story of B'Elanna's dancing lessons in the forest.  Soon they were all laughing at the images of the graceful warrior tripping over her feet by the light of a fire.  Both Harry and B'Elanna agreed to help the King on this most secret mission.  By the end of the night a bond of friendship that would last a lifetime had formed between all four of the soldiers in the tent.</p>
<p>Over the next few days the King and his new advisors, in the persons of Gloucester, Harry and B'Elanna, prepared for their trip to Troyes.  They rode off into the forest alone for several hours each day where the King was schooled in the fine art of talking and dancing with women.  The trips were often just an excuse to leave behind the camp of soldiers and have a moment or two of freedom with friends.  Now that Gloucester knew of Beyla's true identity he was more determined than ever to defeat her in battle, and often the two of them would face off against one another, dueling furiously while Harry attempted to instruct the King in the finer points of the dance.  So far Gloucester had never managed to best Beyla, but that fact only served to strengthen their friendship, not detract from it.</p>
<p>The four of them, along with the Royal bodyguard and several other nobles who were close to the throne rode to Troyes to finalize the details of the treaty.  King Henry met with Catherine and was taken with her beauty, but his awkwardness and poor command of the French language were an impediment at first.  It fell to B'Elanna and Harry to do much of the talking in the beginning, but soon the King overcame his shyness and was able to put forth his suit on his own.  He heeded Beyla's advice and found that Catherine responded to his willingness to listen to her and to take her seriously.  Their marriage was meant to be one of political convenience, but in the end would turn out to be one of abiding love--thanks to the intervention of one of the most unconventional soldiers the King had ever met.  </p>
<p>The marriage and the treaty signing were to take place on the same day at the Cathedral of Troyes and the King wished for Beyla, Harry and Gloucester to stand with him during the ceremony.  The French royal tailors created wondrously rich costumes for all of them.  They were clad in crimson and gold tunics, and their shoulders were draped with ermine lined capes.  Their swords were shone to a brilliant gleam and upon their heads they wore jewel-encrusted bands of gold.  </p>
<p>After the wedding and the signing of the treaty that officially ended the war, all of them attended the banquet at the castle of Troyes.  It was a sumptuous affair despite the fact that France had been decimated by the war.  During the course of the evening B'Elanna found herself standing with the King and Catherine and several of the French royalty when she sensed that she was being scrutinized from across the room.  She turned to see a familiar figure standing at the edge of the crowd.  She made her way through the crowds and soon found herself standing in front of someone she had never thought she would see again.</p>
<p>"Lord Hansart," she said.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla, how is this possible?how did you come to be here with?with the King?" He stammered.</p>
<p>"It would seem my circumstances have changed somewhat since last we met," she spoke coolly.</p>
<p>Lady Hansart had finally noticed to whom her husband was speaking and she came forward quickly and caught B'Elanna in her arms.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla!  I can't believe it is really you.  What of Annika?  Is she all right?"  As ever, Lady Hansart's first concern was for her daughter and her happiness.</p>
<p>"She's fine," B'Elanna hastened to reassure the concerned mother.  "We married shortly after you left England."</p>
<p>"Is she well?is she happy?" Lady Hansart could not contain her joy at finally having news of her daughter.</p>
<p>"I believe she is, although it has been a year since we've seen one another.  I had a letter from her recently and she seemed well. I know she'd love to hear from you; if you'd care to give me a letter I'd be happy to deliver it to her when I return to England next month."</p>
<p>Lord Hansart was not happy at being interrupted by his wife, and he was further incensed at the fact that he was being ignored, but the obvious change in Lord Beyla's fortunes made him reluctant to show his displeasure.  </p>
<p>"I can see that Annika made a wise choice in husbands after all.  Perhaps its time we paid our daughter a visit," he said pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Whether or not you visit Annika is a matter that shall be left entirely up to her.  I'll carry a letter from you and if she wishes to contact you she will.  You wounded her deeply Lord Hansart, and I'll not have her hurt again.  You are to make no attempt to see her until you hear from her that she would welcome the contact."  B'Elanna's voice was stern and Lord Hansart knew better than to argue.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna chatted amicably with Lady Hansart for some time until she saw the King motioning her to come and meet one of the generals from the French army.  She told Lady Hansart where to send the letter so that B'Elanna would receive it and she took an amicable leave from her parents in law.</p>
<p>The next few weeks flew by as the King took control of the French government and made arrangements for garrisons of English troops to be stationed at key cities for the time being.  Gloucester was remaining behind for now to command the occupying army.  He was happy to be entrusted with such an important command, but a little sad to see his friends preparing to depart for home without him.  He promised Beyla that once he was back in England he would seek her out and demand a rematch of their, by now, famous duels.  They parted fast friends and B'Elanna too looked forward to the time when they would recommence their contests.</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Harry were escorting the King and his new wife back to England along with a contingent of the royal bodyguard.  The bulk of the troops would follow a few weeks later.  Because they would be traveling with Catherine, this trip promised to be much more comfortable and leisurely than the one to France had been.</p>
<p>The day of their departure dawned clear and warm, and soon the royal retinue took to the road.  They made the crossing back into England five days later.  After resting for a day in Dover, they found themselves once more on the familiar road to London.  B'Elanna could barely contain herself at the thought that in a few short days she would once again hold Annika in her arms.</p>
