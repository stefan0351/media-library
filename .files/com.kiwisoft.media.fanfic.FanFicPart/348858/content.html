<P>B'Elanna looked at the drained tricorder hoping to try and get any reading
out of it, but to no avail. The temperature on the planet changed from freezing
cold at night to blazing hot in the afternoon. The two were only a few hours
away from the blazing hot, so they wanted to make good time to the apple patch,
walking very briskly. </P>
<P>As B'Elanna tinkered with the tricorder, Seven silently observed the
Lieutenant. The Borg had always admired the Chief Engineer's determination, but
would never admit it openly. B'Elanna's forehead was now dripping in sweat and
her arms were glistening in the bright sunshine. The half-Klingon had wrapped
her Starfleet jacket around her waist hoping to avoid suffocating under the
constant glare of the sun. B'Elanna ran a hand through her wet hair to give
herself a better view at the blank screen in front of her. As she did that, some
sweat from her forehead fell onto the screen. </P>
<P>"Damn it!" B'Elanna went to wipe it off with back of her arm only to make the
situation worse. Now the whole screen was covered in sweat. After thoroughly
cursing herself at the stupidity of the move, she grabbed one of the sleeves
hanging around her waist and began to wipe the screen dry. Then the obvious
happened, a rock jumped out of nowhere and placed itself in the precarious
position of B'Elanna's path. Stumbling like a fool, B'Elanna cursed some more,
as the tricorder flew from her hand and she tried to protect her face from the
fall. </P>
<P>Seven quickly appeared at B'Elanna's side offering a hand to help her up.
Without saying a word, the two exchanged glances, B'Elanna's one of
embarrassment and anger at herself, Seven's being something that can only be
described as a smirk. </P>
<P>B'Elanna reluctantly took Seven's surprisingly dry hand compared to her own.
The Borg swiftly pulled her up and continued on her way. B'Elanna watched now as
Seven was taking the lead, hips swaying in the sunshine. B'Elanna looked at her
hand, which was now soaked in sweat, and wondered how the Borg managed to stay
dry as ice in this weather. Especially in that very tight bio-suit that she
wore. </P>
<P>B'Elanna found herself mesmerized by the tight outfit and the person in it.
She was in fact staring. Suddenly Seven turned around. "Are you coming?" Seven
cocked an eyebrow and waited for a response. B'Elanna quickly turn her eyes to
the ground. 'Uh, yeah, just have to get the tricorder." B'Elanna was trying her
best impression of 'where did I put that pip?' as she searched for the
tricorder, avoiding all eye contact with the beautiful blonde.</P>
<P>Finally, finding it behind a big boulder, B'Elanna picked it up and started
walking towards the apple patch, head down. Seven, seeing this turned around and
continued on her way.</P>
<P>Silence once again gripped the two as they made their way across the grassy
plains. Not that long after, the two reached the apple patch and began searching
for their missing crew member. </P>
<P>"Okay, I'll take this side of the hill, you take the other." B'Elanna finally
spoke, breaking the silence. </P>
<P>"Very well." Seven said in her usual Borg way. </P>
<P>The two split up, B'Elanna walking right into the apple trees, Seven more or
less checking out the open area of the hill. B'Elanna had given up on the
tricorder and decided to search the old fashioned way. Picking up a small
leafless branch off the ground, B'Elanna started mowing her way through the
leaves and apples while screaming Ensign Parker's name.</P>
<P>Seven, methodically searched the open hill side looking for any sign of the
young Ensign. But she was distracted by B'Elanna's constant yelling. Surely if
Ensign Parker could respond, she would have already. But B'Elanna insisted on
continuing her screaming campaign. This annoyed the Borg to no end. Finally, she
found some sign of the young Ensign, a pile of apples. It was placed on the
opposite side of the hill, protected from the wind last night. But Parker was
nowhere to be found. Now it was Seven's turn to scream.</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres I have found something." Seven shouted in B'Elanna's general
direction. No response. "Lt. Torres?" Again no response. Seven was now worried.
She made a beeline for the trees when B'Elanna suddenly burst out of the leaves
and apples nearly running right into her. "Wow, what's up Seven!" B'Elanna said
backing up a little from the closeness. </P>
<P>"What is up, is that I called your name twice and you did not answer." Seven
said obviously frustrated. "Really? I didn't hear you." B'Elanna said
innocently.</P>
<P>"Maybe if you had spent more time looking rather than shouting you would have
heard me." Seven was now venting in the only way she knew how.</P>
<P>"Okay. That was uncalled for, but we don't have time to argue, so did you
find something?" It was B'Elanna trying to calm the waters for once. Seven's
look of annoyance did not go away, but she decided not to pursue the matter.
"Yes, over on the other side of the hill is a small pile of apples which I
believe was made by Ensign Parker." Seven was now back in Borg efficiency mode.
"That, or a small little bunny rabbit trying to horde all the apples." B'Elanna
joked. Seven did not find that the least bit amusing. B'Elanna knew that her
humor was lost on the Borg, so she simply sighed. "Okay, lead the way." B'Elanna
motioned with her arms. </P>
<P>Seven, turned and walked briskly to the site of the pile. B'Elanna quickly
pulled out her tricorder and attempted to scan the pile looking for any traces
of Parker, then remembered the thing didn’t work. "Sorry, force of habit." She
said to Seven who was staring at her. Dropping the tricorder, she picked up an
apple not exactly sure what she was looking for. After examining the apple,
B'Elanna decided to look for any foot prints or anything that could tell her the
whereabouts of the young Ensign. Okay, either some big animal took her or she
went off looking for some shelter. Either way, I have no idea which direction
she went. </P>
<P>"I find that surprising." Seven responded. "And why exactly do you find that
surprising? I don't see you coming up with anything better." B'Elanna said
defensively. </P>
<P>"It has been my experience that Commander Chakotay tends to talk extensively
on his Native American searching techniques when we are on away missions." Seven
stated. B'Elanna just had to laugh. "I know the feeling, unfortunately I was
always distracted during his searching lectures." B'Elanna laughed. </P>
<P>"Distracted by what." Seven questioned.</P>
<P>"Oh no one, I mean nothing." B'Elanna quickly corrected herself. "Why don't
we just head in the direction of the caves, you said they were over there
right?" B'Elanna pointed, hoping that Seven would drop the subject. Fortunately
for B'Elanna, Seven did not push the subject and simply nodded confirmation.</P>
<P>"Okay, let me just get some apples and we can be on our way." B'Elanna picked
up as many as she could hold and fit into the jacket around her waist, then
headed for the caves with a very annoyed Borg.</P>
<P>Seven meanwhile, was thinking about B'Elanna's slip of the tongue, and what
exactly it had meant. </P>
