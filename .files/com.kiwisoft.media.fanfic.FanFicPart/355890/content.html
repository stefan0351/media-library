<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 7: Into the Labyrinth -->

<p>Joey and Kaela tiptoed silently back to Joey's room, shivering from the cold they'd just subjected themselves to, in their pajamas no less. When they got there and the door was closed, Joey sighed, relieved that she could speak without fear of waking anyone up. Kaela sat down on the floor and buried her head in her knees.</p>
		<p>"Kaela, will you look at me?" Joey sat down next to her, watching the top of her head expectantly.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Please don't do this," Joey begged, putting her hand gently on Kaela's arm. That got her. Her head shot up almost involuntarily, revealing her tear streaked face and red eyes. Her line of vision crossed Joey's momentarily, but then she jerked her eyes down again.</p>
		<p>Joey grabbed her chin with one hand, forcing her to make eye contact. "Look at me, dammit. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere."</p>
		<p>Joey could hardly feel anything; it was as if she'd put her own emotions on hold the minute Kaela had freaked out, knowing she needed to help her deal with what she was feeling before she could think of herself.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," Kaela managed to whisper.</p>
		<p>"I told you already, don't you ever say that. Do *not* apologize for how you feel, not to anyone, least of all to me. It will poison you," Joey said with grim certainty. She couldn't bear to see the amount of pain all this secrecy had already caused Kaela, especially since she knew what it had been like for her, with Dawson-- and this could only be harder.</p>
		<p>"I'm so scared, I feel like I'm going to throw up."</p>
		<p>"What are you scared of, Honey?" Joey asked gently.</p>
		<p>"That you hate me, you're just too nice to tell me I'm a disgusting pervert, you're never going to want to see me again." Kaela's voice, though barely a whisper, cracked on the last few words.</p>
		<p>"I don't hate you, Kaela, I'm not going to run away from you. I love you, you're my friend, you're one of my best friends. There's nothing to be scared of," Joey said tenderly, brushing a strand of hair off Kaela's face.</p>
		<p>"Nothing to be scared of?" Kaela laughed bitterly. "You have no idea how much I have to be scared of, Jo. How about going through the rest of high school knowing I can't hold hands with someone I like in the hallway? That I can't have anything normal, like the prom or homecoming or all that stupid shit? How about getting teased, or beat up, or killed? How about hating myself for the rest of my life?" Kaela's eyes slanted ruefully as she spoke, the tears never ending over her cheeks.</p>
		<p>"Look, no one said life was easy," Joey said, shaking her head. "I know there's a lot to be scared of out there...but I'm talking about *in here*, right now. No one's going to hurt you here. I'm not going to hurt you."</p>
		<p>"Joey," Kaela sighed with a twisted smile, "you hurt me every time you walk into the room. Every time I see you, every time you walk by and I smell your shampoo, it hurts."</p>
		<p>She pressed her hand over her chest, as if to locate the pain. "It's poison, like you said, knowing every single second that if you had the faintest idea of the things I'm thinking about you...God, you'd probably puke."</p>
		<p>Kaela was looking down at her hands again, and Joey was watching her expression change, which it did approximately every ten seconds. She stared at the freckles splayed across Kaela's nose, that Joey always thought made her look so innocent. She looked at her cheeks, that were shining with the trails of tears.</p>
		<p>"How do you know I'd puke?" Joey asked softly.</p>
		<p>Kaela raised her eyes slowly, wary now that she was so vulnerable.</p>
		<p>"You're in love with Dawson," she said simply.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I am, and I would never cheat on him, but...I'm not blind, Kaela."</p>
		<p>Joey didn't know what she was doing or why, only that her mouth was somehow bypassing her brain, and speaking without consulting any thought process. Kaela didn't say anything in reply, just watched Joey cautiously, raising one eyebrow a little.</p>
		<p>"I mean," Joey continued softly, "Pacey's not the only one in the world who thinks you're beautiful. Everyone thinks so...I think so."</p>
		<p>Joey didn't look away as she spoke. She kept her eyes up, so Kaela could see her honesty.</p>
		<p>"What's happening here, Jo?" Kaela finally asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't know, but I'm going to set a ground rule right now: I am not going to cheat on Dawson in any way."</p>
		<p>"Okay," Kaela said quietly, her heart rate rising for the third time that night.</p>
		<p>"Now," Joey continued, "with that in mind-- I have an idea." Kaela nodded in assention to whatever Joey's idea was. It could have been to throw themselves off a building, she wouldn't have been able to say no to Joey.</p>
		<p>"I think," Joey continued, "that we should play truth or dare-- only without the dare."</p>
		<p>That took some of the pressure off, she thought, enough that they could both handle it, and she wouldn't do anything that Dawson would regret. Kaela nodded, and Joey sighed.</p>
		<p>"Good. I'll start. This will be a warm up round. ...Why do you have a blonde sister and a black brother, when you and your mom both have brown hair and freckles?"</p>
		<p>"They're adopted," Kaela said quickly, relieved that she could answer this one without her blood pressure going up. "My mom's a social worker, you know, she was on the state foster parents list for a long time...they were both crack babies we took in, just temporarily, but you know how bureaucracy is...by the time there was any chance of finding them permanent families, they were walking and talking, and saying 'Mommy.' We couldn't let them go."</p>
		<p>Joey felt her own eyes fill for a moment, but she blinked it away quickly, she couldn't cry now when they'd just started.</p>
		<p>"Your turn," Joey said quietly.</p>
		<p>Kaela swallowed the lump in her throat as she felt her skin getting hot. "Where are your parents?"</p>
		<p>"My dad's in jail," Joey murmured, hugging her knees. "Drugs. He sold pot while I was off at school during the day, and then I'd ask him how work had been. And my mom...she died two years ago. Breast cancer."</p>
		<p>The intensity of the night and the late hour began to get the better of Joey, and she felt a tear wriggle free and slip down her cheek.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Joey," Kaela whispered, about to reach out for her hand to comfort her. Then she remembered the ground rule, and decided against it. She didn't want to fuck up one more thing that night. "Your turn again."</p>
		<p>Joey wiped the tear away and took a deep breath, looking at Kaela mischievously. "When did you first start having a crush on me?"</p>
		<p>"Joey!" Kaela cried despondently.</p>
		<p>"You have to answer, Kaela, the game is Truth, we agreed already."</p>
		<p>She leaned in close to Kaela's ear and whispered, "I promise not to tell..."</p>
		<p>"Okay," Kaela sighed shakily, unable to keep up eye contact for this part.</p>
		<p>"I've had a crush on you since the first time I saw you, Joey. First day of Spanish class. You were wearing this cute little tank top, it was gray, and those khaki cutoffs..." Kaela stopped for a moment, panicking, but regained her composure by staring out the window.</p>
		<p>"I was sitting two rows behind you, a little to the left, and I didn't listen to one word Mrs. Adelman said the whole class. You were so beautiful," she finished, trembling.</p>
		<p>After a moment of silence in which Joey couldn't think of anything to say, she finally reminded Kaela that it was her turn.</p>
		<p>"What was the first thing you thought after I..." Kaela wavered, taking in a deep breath for strength. "After I kissed you?"</p>
		<p>Joey bit her lip, staring at her fingernails in a moment of concentration. "When I jumped back, I was thinking about Dawson."</p>
		<p>Kaela's heart sank. She always expected too much.</p>
		<p>"But there was a little, tiny moment just before that..." Joey trailed off and Kaela watched her brown eyes shine.</p>
		<p>She'd thought there was a moment just before that, too, but then she'd thought it was just her imagination.</p>
		<p>"I wasn't really thinking anything, though, I was just feeling something."</p>
		<p>"What were you feeling?" Kaela whispered, barely audible.</p>
		<p>Joey traced her finger over Kaela's lower lip, until she closed her eyes. Then she leaned in gently, until Kaela could feel Joey's breath on her mouth.</p>
		<p>"This." Joey kissed her softly, demonstrating the feeling for both of them. This one lasted a bit longer than the first one, and Kaela reached for Joey's hand, lacing their fingers together. Joey was just letting her tongue wander when Kaela pulled away.</p>
		<p>"What about the ground rule?" Kaela asked nervously, a little breathless.</p>
		<p>"I forgot."</p>
		<p>"Oh." Kaela's heart felt like it had just been lifted to the top of Mount Everest-- and then thrown off.</p>
		<p>"Well now do you remember?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," Joey said trembling. "I shouldn't have done that, I didn't mean to lead you on."</p>
		<p>She had to remind herself that she had the upper hand, Kaela was practically a puppy at her feet. Or a kitten.</p>
		<p>"What did you mean?" Kaela asked angrily, getting tired of the game.</p>
		<p>"Just trying to see if you could get a rise off me? Well it worked, okay, congratulations, I'm hot for you."</p>
		<p>This new wound was almost the worst; for a moment she'd been so close, so vulnerable...</p>
		<p>"No, that wasn't what I meant to do at all, I just-- Jesus, Kaela, you think I'm not a little riled up too?"</p>
		<p>The twisted anger on Kaela's face softened, and she let her guard down again, hoping she would still be alive in the morning.</p>
		<p>"I've never...been in a situation like this before," Joey said slowly, choosing her words carefully.</p>
		<p>"I don't want to turn my back on it."</p>
		<p>"What about Dawson?"</p>
		<p>Joey hadn't thought that far ahead yet. She hadn't even thought to tomorrow. All she could think of was how she felt, right then, the heat that was building in her that wasn't like anything else she'd ever felt. It was scary and exciting, like the first time Dawson kissed her-- but different; she felt so powerful. She didn't want to lose Dawson; she didn't love him any less, but wasn't there room inside her for loving more than one person?</p>
		<p>"I guess Dawson and I have to talk about...non-monogomy."</p>
		<p>"Dammit, Jo, this is a mistake." Kaela's stomach knotted into a French twist as she felt a wave of dizziness pass over her.</p>
		<p>"You have this amazing, perfect boyfriend, and you're totally in love with him, and you want to fuck with that for my sake?"</p>
		<p>She shook her head vehemently, realizing how far over their heads they were.</p>
		<p>"We're talking major confusion here, Joey, I don't think you get it. You think we can just screw around and that'll be all? There'll be rumors by the dozen, dirty looks, more than that."</p>
		<p>Kaela's pulse had moved into her throat, making it difficult to breathe properly.</p>
		<p>"I get it just fine, and I'm no stranger to rumors," Joey threw back at her, a little defensively.</p>
		<p>"And as far as confusion-- we're *fifteen*, Kaela, this is the time for it. If not now, then when? At thirty-five, when we're married and settled down with kids, and we realize it's too late to explore?"</p>
		<p>Kaela was crying again, unprepared for how real this all was.</p>
		<p>"Just don't tease me, Joey, I couldn't take it...if you realize tomorrow that this was just an interesting night and some cool experience you can write down in your journal, you can just go back to Dawson and everything will be fine. But it's not like that for me," she said, shaking.</p>
		<p>"I...I'm falling on my ass in love with you."</p>
		<p>This time Kaela didn't look away. Joey took both her hands tightly and held them for a minute before she spoke.</p>
		<p>"I'm not teasing you. And as for being in love, I'm not sure I even know what that means anymore, but I do love you."</p>
		<p>Joey let go of one of Kaela's hands to stroke her hair, brushing her ear as she tucked a strand behind it. She saw Kaela shiver.</p>
		<p>"And I'm not going anywhere."</p>
		<p>Kaela's heart rate was racing out of control; why did Joey have to touch her ear like that?</p>
		<p>"Kiss me?" she whispered.</p>
		<p>This time Joey's tongue wasn't so timid.</p>
		<p>Jen couldn't imagine who had the audacity to call her at nine am on Saturday. Whoever it was, she thought as she reached for the receiver, they were definitely going to pay.</p>
		<p>"This better be important," she mumbled as she picked up.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry Jen, I know it's early, but I really have to talk to you."</p>
		<p>"Joey?" Jen sat up, committing to being awake as she focused on the voice at the other end.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I guess I should've said that."</p>
		<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
		<p>"Well it's not really that anything's the matter, it's just-- or, or maybe something is the matter...I don't even know, it's-- a situation."</p>
		<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
		<p>"Look, I don't really want to talk about this on the phone...can we meet somewhere?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, you want to come over?"</p>
		<p>"No, I can't risk seeing Dawson before-- um, before I get a few things, well, straight."</p>
		<p>Joey began to giggle; Jen had no idea why.</p>
		<p>"Okay, fine. How about The Coffee Exchange, in like an hour?"</p>
		<p>"Half an hour?"</p>
		<p>"It's Saturday morning, Joey," Jen whined.</p>
		<p>"Please Jen, please, please, please? I'm about to explode!"</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay, jeez," Jen sighed, thinking that Joey was quite a closet drama-queen.</p>
		<p>She was getting pretty curious, though, and she had to admit that it was nice that Joey chose her to ask about it...she wondered why she didn't go to Kaela, they were so close lately, they'd actually been ignoring Jen a lot. And she wondered what was wrong between Joey and Dawson...could this be her chance? She'd have to wait and assess the situation. Maybe she wouldn't end up going out drinking again tonight after all.</p>
		<p>Joey was already waiting at a table when Jen walked in. She'd probably run right over the second she'd gotten off the phone, Jen thought. She looked awfully excited for someone who was theoretically having a fight with her boyfriend...actually, she had a definite radiance about her, but there was a measure of anxiety in her eyes. What on earth was going on?</p>
		<p>"Hey," Joey sighed as Jen sat down, "thanks for coming."</p>
		<p>"No problem," Jen said wryly. "So what the hell is going on around here, anyway? I feel like I've hardly spoken to you in a week."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I guess I've been pretty removed lately...um, this is all going to sound really crazy, Jen, and before I tell you, you have to promise not to tell *any*one, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Of course," Jen said, a little shocked that Joey thought she had to ask.</p>
		<p>"Okay. Well I know I haven't been around that much lately, and you're under no obligation to sit here and listen to all of this, but...you're the only person I can think of who might understand."</p>
		<p>Joey swallowed nervously; she hadn't realized how hard this would be to talk about.</p>
		<p>"I...I kind of cheated on Dawson last night."</p>
		<p>"Kind of?"</p>
		<p>"We didn't have sex..."</p>
		<p>At least, I don't think we did, Joey thought for a bewildering moment. She wasn't sure what counted.</p>
		<p>"But-- but we fooled around a lot, and now I don't know what to do because I know I have to tell him but I don't want to break up with him, but I don't know how receptive he'll be to the idea of...a non-monogomous relationship," Joey finished breathlessly, having strung about three different sentences into one.</p>
		<p>"Wow," Jen said under her breath. Who'd have thought Joey would get so racy?</p>
		<p>"Who's the guy?" she asked mischievously, running down the possibilities in her head.</p>
		<p>There didn't seem to be too many; Joey never seemed to look at any boys other than Dawson, except for that cute, preppy yacht kid who'd come through with his parents last August...but that had been so long ago.</p>
		<p>Joey flushed bright crimson, and Jen was intrigued.</p>
		<p>"Um," she said slowly, "that's the...interesting part."</p>
		<p>Jen rested her chin in her hand expectantly.</p>
		<p>"It's...well, it's not a guy."</p>
		<p>"Oh...well then," was all Jen could think to say.</p>
		<p>Shock didn't begin to describe her reaction.</p>
		<p>"It's Kaela," Joey admitted grinning, her flush changing slowly to a glow, accompanied by a dopey smile.</p>
		<p>"So what the hell am I doing here, Jen?"</p>
		<p>"Well, you're living," Jen said, laughing in disbelief.</p>
		<p>"But I want to live past today!" Joey exclaimed, giving way to a moment of panic.</p>
		<p>She'd been having a new emotion every ten minutes since last night.</p>
		<p>"You will," Jen said simply, "whether you like it or not."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, that's really helpful."</p>
		<p>"Well what do you want me to tell you, Joey?" Jen asked, leaning back in her chair as if she had the secret of the universe, to be released all in good time.</p>
		<p>"I want...I want you to tell me if you've ever been attracted to a girl."</p>
		<p>"Sure, a couple of times," Jen said as if she were being questioned about her flossing habits. "Most people have thought about it, Jo."</p>
		<p>"But did you ever *do* it?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Why not?"</p>
		<p>"I guess I never met a girl I was attracted to enough to really want to...I mean, looking is one thing, low-stress, low-inertia. But I'm not going to spend all my time and energy going after someone unless I really feel something, and I just haven't ever had that feeling for a girl."</p>
		<p>"I never have either, before this."</p>
		<p>"Well," Jen grinned devilishly, "I guess this explains why you guys have been ignoring me..."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Jen, there's no excuse for--"</p>
		<p>"Forget it, Joey, it's not worth it. Forgiven. Now we have to deal with the question at hand."</p>
		<p>"Right," Joey nodded, feeling her stomach tighten. "What am I going to say to Dawson?"</p>
		<p>"It depends..."</p>
		<p>"Depends on what?"</p>
		<p>"Your priorities. If your highest priority is not to break up with him, then you can throw yourself at his feet in repentance and give him the doe eyes. That would probably mean no more sleepovers with Kaela."</p>
		<p>"I don't know what my priorities are," Joey said miserably.</p>
		<p>"I couldn't stand losing Dawson...but I don't think 'losing him' means the same thing for me that it might mean for another couple. We knew going into this that it wouldn't be forever, unbroken...nothing that starts at fifteen can be. But we're never going to not be best friends...this would make it so weird, though..." Joey sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose.</p>
		<p>"Damn, this is so complicated."</p>
		<p>"Yup," Jen said, becoming more Yoda-like and monosyllabic every minute.</p>
		<p>"You're not helping, you know."</p>
		<p>"Okay, fine, here's another question: how was last night?"</p>
		<p>"It was the most intense thing that I ever...I can't explain, it was so amazing."</p>
		<p>"Better than with Dawson?"</p>
		<p>"No," Joey said quickly, dashing Jen's hopes that she might be able to guide Joey down the path towards break-up.</p>
		<p>Why was she being so selfish? Well, she reasoned, if Joey could pick who she wanted, why couldn't she?</p>
		<p>"It wasn't better, God, I love Dawson more than anything. It was just really different. Dawson makes me feel hot, and Kaela just makes me hot."</p>
		<p>"I don't get you," Jen said, shaking her head.</p>
		<p>"I know, that didn't make any sense...okay, let me try it again. When I'm with Dawson, I feel like I'm beautiful, I'm hot like 'he wants me' hot, I let him do whatever he wants, and that's amazing. With Kaela...I mean there's that, too, but there's also what *I* can do to *her*, you know? God, I just can't articulate this."</p>
		<p>"No, I get it-- I mean, I think I do."</p>
		<p>"So I just can't choose, that's the problem I guess. And then I thought, why should I? Isn't this the time for...for not being with just one person? I mean, that's what marriage is for!"</p>
		<p>"Hey, you don't have to tell me," Jen said defensively. "I'm with you on this one. The question is, do you think Dawson will be?"</p>
		<p>They both knew the answer before she even asked.</p>
		<p>"I have to go talk to him," Joey said shakily, getting scared all over again. She knew high school was supposed to be a roller-coaster, but why did it seem that this one was all loop-the-loops?</p>
		<p>"Hey Jo," Dawson said happily as she climbed in his bedroom window.</p>
		<p>"I missed you all day, you're just in time for movie night."</p>
		<p>"Can you put movie night on pause, Dawson? I have to talk to you," Joey said, hoping these nervous stomach aches were not going to be a new trend in her life.</p>
		<p>"Sure, what's up?" Joey sat down on Dawson's bed, tracing the pattern on the bedspread with her finger.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Dawson was terrified.</p>
		<p>"I did something I shouldn't have done, Dawson, but maybe that doesn't even matter, because the emotions behind it are real either way, so the actions hardly make that any different..."</p>
		<p>Dawson felt himself holding his breath.</p>
		<p>"Joey, what is it?" he asked softly, standing nervously a few feet away from her.</p>
		<p>"I cheated on you last night, Dawson."</p>
		<p>Joey's eyes were blurring with tears, but Dawson was too confused to react. Hadn't Joey been with...</p>
		<p>"I don't-- what are you talking about?"</p>
		<p>"We didn't have sex. And I...I didn't start it," Joey finished lamely, as if that made it better somehow.</p>
		<p>"Oh my God," Dawson murmured, disbelieving.</p>
		<p>"I wasn't expecting her to kiss me," Joey said, knowing she didn't need to say any more.</p>
		<p>Dawson felt his whole body go numb for a second. Joey? With Kaela? The image flashed into his mind for half a second, but he pushed it away before letting himself think it might turn him on. That would be downright low.</p>
		<p>"...What, are you bi or something?" Dawson finally managed to ask, recovering slowly from his daze.</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Dawson," Joey said shakily, the tears in her eyes beginning to flow.</p>
		<p>"But what if I were? Would it change anything between us?"</p>
		<p>Dawson wanted to say no right away, but...he couldn't be sure that would be true. Where would he stand with her? He knew where he was in terms of desirability-- with guys, at least there were rules...but how the hell could he compete with Kaela Barnes? New hairstyle, better makeup?</p>
		<p>"I don't know," he admitted.</p>
		<p>"Think you can stick around to find out?"</p>
		<p>"Jesus, Joey...would you ask me to let you go off and have an affair with some guy? This isn't fair!"</p>
		<p>"I don't want to lose you over this, Dawson, please understand," Joey begged.</p>
		<p>"Well this is a hell of a way to go about it," Dawson said incredulously. "You're telling me that you cheated on me and asking for my permission to keep on doing it all in the same breath?"</p>
		<p>"I love you, Dawson, as much as I ever did, as much as one human being can possibly love another...does that mean I can't love someone else too?"</p>
		<p>"Great, Jo, that's just great. You've been taking lessons from my mother."</p>
		<p>"Dawson!" Joey gasped, horrified. Dawson regretted his words almost instantly.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," he said quietly, going over to her and touching her shoulder for the first time since she'd come in. "I just-- how do I compete with a girl? With Kaela?"</p>
		<p>"Just challenge her to a little one-on-one. If she beats you, you can always break her nose," Joey spat at him. She wondered how Pacey would handle this.</p>
		<p>"I said I'm sorry!" Dawson yelled.</p>
		<p>"Just forget it," Joey muttered ruefully, grabbing her jacket and heading towards the window.</p>
		<p>"Where are you going?" Dawson implored, a bit less harshly.</p>
		<p>"This is going nowhere, Dawson, it won't do us any good to keep yelling at each other. I'm going to cool off, and I suggest you do the same."</p>
		<p>"If you see anybody else you like on the way, just leave a message, I'll give you over-the-phone approval to screw around with whoever you want."</p>
		<p>"Fuck you," Joey whispered, her vision clouded over with tears.</p>
		<p>"I guess that's not likely now either."</p>
		<p>Joey disappeared so quickly, he couldn't have pulled her back even if he had come to his senses a moment earlier. What was he doing? But what the hell was she trying to do to *him*, anyway? Frustration quickly turned to anger, and he slammed his window down and turned the lock.</p>
