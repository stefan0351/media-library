<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 4 -->

<p>(Why did I say those things?) Brooke groaned as she returned
to her room. She saw the raw devastation on Sam's face and hated herself for it.
She knew Sam had feelings, Hell, Sam probably felt things deeper than most
people did. And yet she had just accused Sam of being an unfeeling brat, or
worse, incapable of feeling anything other than anger. Incapable of love.
</p>
<p>(She'll never feel anything but resentment and hatred for you
now, you jerk) Brooke yelled at herself for her stupidity. (Why did I have to
bait her? I should have just kept my mouth shut. I didn't mean any of it) she
sighed as she collapsed onto her bed, upset with herself. </p>
<p>(You're a real piece of work, you know that Brooke? You love
her so much she's all you can think about and yet you hurt her with your
careless words. You don't deserve her) Brooke told herself angrily. If she had
witnessed anyone else speaking to Sam in such a matter, she would have slapped
them. It was what she felt she deserved but she figured she'd seem foolish
slapping herself. </p>
<p>(I'm going to have to make it up to her somehow) she realized.
(I just wish I knew how) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam was lying on her bed crying because of the pain that
Brooke's words had caused her. </p>
<p>"I wish you knew, Brooke," she sobbed quietly. "How much I
feel. How much I feel for you. I DO feel more than anger. I love you so much I
just don't know how to tell you," she sniffled. </p>
<p>(Why did Brooke have to say such mean things? I know she
doesn't care for me but she didn't have to be so mean, I didn't do anything to
her really. Yes, I got snotty but I wasn't cruel. God I wish she didn't hate me
and think so little of me. Even if she doesn't love me, I wish she'd at least
like me a little) </p>
<p>She rolled over in her bed and decided not to go to school
that day. She wasn't in the mood to play `Dodge Brooke McQueen' for eight hours.
She figured missing one day wasn't that big a deal plus she'd have Carmen or
Lily give her her missed assignments. Frankly, if she had her own way, she'd
like to just curl up in the corner and die but she knew that wasn't going to
happen. </p>
<p>(Why does she wind me up so bad?) she wondered. (Half the crap
Nicole says is meaner than anything Brooke says and yet Brooke can cut me deeper
with her words than Satan can. Why is that? Why do I let Brooke get to me?) Of
course, she already knew the answers. (Because you love her and the one's we
love always hurt us the worst, whether they know it or not) She pulled the
covers over her head. </p>
<p>(I hate my life) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Mom, can I talk to you?" Sam asked the next day when she
found her mother alone in the kitchen. After another night of vivid dreams and
another day of avoiding Brooke, Sam was at her wits end and decided to spill the
news to her mother and ask for advice. Of course, she had every intention of
doing some creative editing when she spoke to her mother, but the point would be
the same. </p>
<p>"Of course you can, hon, you know that," Jane answered
seriously. She could tell by the serious look on Sam's face and the tense way
Sam held herself that something was really bothering her daughter. </p>
<p>"I know, it's just this is something hard to talk about," Sam
sighed as she sat down. Jane frowned at her. Sam never had trouble talking to
her so whatever it was it must be big. </p>
<p>"OK, well, just start at the beginning," Jane suggested. Sam
nodded and took a deep breath. </p>
<p>"Mom, you'd love me no matter what, right?" </p>
<p>"Yes, Sam, there's nothing that would change that," Jane
assured her. Sam ran a hand through her hair and tried to find the courage and
words to say what she needed to. </p>
<p>"Mom," she started while staring at the tabletop, "well, for a
while now I've noticed that there's something going on with me that isn't what
you'd expect." (Gee Sam, vague much?) Sam asked herself. </p>
<p>"What do you mean, Sam?" Jane asked. </p>
<p>"I have these thoughts, these feelings for someone and, oh
God?" she trailed off and buried her face in her hands at a loss for words. Jane
watched her daughter falter and it confused her. Sam was never at a loss for
words. </p>
<p>"Sam," she said gently. "You know you can tell me anything."
Sam looked back up at her mother and Jane saw the fear and apprehension on her
face. </p>
<p>"Mom?geeze, I'm just gonna say it, these feelings are for a
woman." (There I said it) She shut her eyes and waited for her mother to start
screaming. </p>
<p>"Oh," was all Jane said. Sam opened her eyes. </p>
<p>"Oh?" she parroted. Jane shrugged. </p>
<p>"Oh," Jane repeated. "And when did you realize this?"
</p>
<p>"Ah?a long time ago, actually," Sam answered honestly, shocked
that her mother was thus far so calm. Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"Do you think it's love?" Jane asked. Sam stuttered at her for
a few moments before forming a coherent response. </p>
<p>"Uh?yeah Mom, I think it is," she finally said. Jane nodded
slowly again. </p>
<p>"Have you told her, the girl I mean?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"That's just it, Mom, I can't," she complained softly. Jane
frowned. </p>
<p>"Why is that?" </p>
<p>"She hates me for one," Sam laughed bitterly. "She's straight
for two. And even if she weren't, she'd never be interested in me. Three
strikes, I'm out. No pun intended. Mom, I'm all tied up in knots and I don't
know what to do." </p>
<p>"Well, honestly Sam, I don't know what to tell you. It's a new
one on me," Jane told her. Sam hung her head. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mom." </p>
<p>"Don't apologize for being honest or for being yourself,
honey. I still love you this doesn't change that." Sam tilted her head and
looked at her mother in surprise. </p>
<p>"So my being gay doesn't shock you?" she asked. Jane sighed. </p>
<p>"Shock? No, I am a bit in denial though. And I'm worried for
you in the long run. It's a tough life given the way our society is, Sam, and I
hate to see you setting yourself up for that but I understand that it isn't a
choice. There's nothing I can do or you can do. You're still Sam, right?" Sam
wiped away a few relieved tears and smiled. </p>
<p>"Yup." </p>
<p>"Then that's all that matters. You're still my daughter and I
love you. But as for what do to about your feelings, Sam, I have no idea what to
tell you. Does she have a boyfriend?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not right now, no. But she has dated guys in the past." </p>
<p>"Why do you think she wouldn't be interested in you if she
were gay or bi, Sam?" Sam shrugged. She was surprised at her mother's line of
questioning but relieved that she was willing to talk. </p>
<p>"Cuz I'm me. You have to understand Mom, this girl is
everything I'm not. She's special. And she could have anyone she wanted, male or
female. There are plenty of better choices than me," Sam said sadly. "Not to
mention the whole `she hates me' thing." </p>
<p>"Oh, Sammy, when did your self-esteem plummet so low?" Jane
asked with a parental sigh. {You know the one I mean} </p>
<p>"I dunno," she thumped her head on the table. "What do I do
now?" </p>
<p>"Tell her," Jane said suddenly making Sam's head snap up so
fast her chair tilted back dangerously. She regained her balance and stared at
her mother in shock. </p>
<p>"Excuse me, I MUST have heard that one wrong. Wanna repeat
that one?" </p>
<p>"Tell her how you feel, Sam," Jane said with absolutely no
idea why she was giving this advice other than she wanted to see Sam happy and
not torn up like she was now. </p>
<p>"I can't. She'll turn around and destroy me with this," Sam
complained. Jane arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Are you talking about Nicole?" she asked, the very thought
leaving a bad taste in her mouth. Jane really didn't like Nicole Julian. Sam
turned green. </p>
<p>"EW! NO! Oh God, Mom, evil imagery!" Sam protested. Jane
turned green and Sam knew what she was thinking. "AND IT'S NOT MARY CHERRY
EITHER!" she shouted. Jane stopped hyperventilating. </p>
<p>"Mom," Sam said calmer, "stop trying to guess and just help me
out here, OK?" (Oh, please don't keep guessing. You're getting too close as it
is. I'm sunk if you guess that it's Brooke) </p>
<p>"Sam, I can't see any other solution other than keeping quiet
or telling her. Do you?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"I guess not." She stood up to leave and gave Jane a hug.
"Thanks for listening, Mom." Jane smiled. </p>
<p>"Anytime, Sam. And you can talk to me about this anytime you
need to, OK?" </p>
<p>"Thanks." </p>
