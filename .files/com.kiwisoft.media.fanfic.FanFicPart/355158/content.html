<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Six -->

<p>Sam kept one eye on the TV and the other on Brooke sitting on the other end of the couch, silent and apparently upset. Her arms were crossed over her chest, her body was held taut like a high wire, and she wasn't watching the TV so much as glowering at it. Sam figured that if Brooke had heat vision, like Superman, the TV would be a big smoldering pile of slag by now. Granted, Sam was no big fan of Buffy anymore either, but glaring at the television wasn't going to help the story lines improve any.</p>
<p>She wanted to ask Brooke what was on her mind, but every attempt to talk to the slender blonde since her headache two days earlier was met with monosyllabic answers and non-interest. And she didn't want to make Brooke any more upset. She just wanted to support her and be there. But Sam didn't know how she could help if she didn't know what was wrong.</p>
<p>She was about to try again when the phone rang. She reached over and picked it up, brushing the hair out of her face as she moved.</p>
<p>"Hello?" she asked.</p>
<p>"May I speak with Samantha McPherson, please?" the voice on the other end asked politely. Sam frowned. She wasn't expecting any phone calls.</p>
<p>"This is she. How can I help you?"</p>
<p>"You're evil, you know that right?" the voice changed from sweet and lilting to dark and angry. "What you've done goes against the eyes of God. You're going to Hell. How does that make you feel?" The voice was almost growling now. Sam arched an eyebrow and pulled the phone away from her ear, eyeing it in shock.</p>
<p>"Who the fuck is this and where did you get this number?" she asked, trying keep her voice down and not get Brooke's attention. She stood up and walked into the kitchen. Brooke, lost in her own thoughts, barely noticed.</p>
<p>"You're going to Hell and you're taking that innocent girl with you," the voice continued.</p>
<p>"Get help, Harrison," Sam hissed, not sure if it was Harrison but knowing he had something to do with it.</p>
<p>"Seriously, Sam," Harrison went on, no longer disguising his voice. "Homosexuality goes against the church. Weren't you raised Catholic?"</p>
<p>"Harrison," Sam sighed. "Apples and oranges. A lot of things are against the church, like the hatred, bigotry, and vengeance you're displaying. Besides, I think the church has a lot bigger problems right now than a lapsed Catholic who's gay. My sexuality and my religion are two separate issues and never the twain shall meet."</p>
<p>"WHAT ABOUT BROOKE?" Harrison screamed into the phone making Sam flinch. "Did you put ANY thought into what's going to happen to her? What happens when her memory comes back?"</p>
<p>"Christ, Harrison, there are some facts you need to get straight. One, SHE pursued the relationship DESPITE my reservations and objections. It was something SHE made clear that SHE wanted. I didn't force her into ANYTHING, least of all this. Second, according to Brooke's old diary, she never had a 'thing' for you. It was ALWAYS me," she taunted haughtily. "So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, you ignorant little BASTARD!" Her voice rose with every syllable of the last sentence until she slammed the remote phone down on the counter.</p>
<p>"Prick," she sighed, rubbing her eyes as a headache started to form. She suddenly felt totally drained and staggered out of the kitchen to the stairs.</p>
<p>"I'm going to bed, Brooke," she mumbled. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Who was on the phone?" Brooke asked absently, turning her head slightly. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Wrong number."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Come on, Brooke, it's OK, just balance and pedal," she heard her father coax. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"Daddy, I can't. I'm scared I'll fall," she complained as he ran beside her bicycle. The pink and white flowered bike with the white wicker basket on the front glided down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Then you'll get back up and try again sweety," he said gently.</p>
<p>"It'll hurt," the six-year-old pointed out as she continued pedaling and trying to steer the two-wheeler.</p>
<p>"You're a big girl, Brooke, don't whine," Mike said firmly. He started to let go as he noticed that she could hold it steady.</p>
<p>"Don't let go, Daddy! Don't let go!" Brooke begged as she felt his grip loosen. "Don't leave me!" Mike laughed.</p>
<p>"I'm right here, Brooke. I'll always be right here," he assured her. "You do this Brooke, and there's no stopping you." He let go with one extra push and watched as she effortlessly rode down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"You're doing it Brooke! You're riding a big girl's bike. Look! No training wheels!" Brooke looked and saw that she was indeed doing it all by herself and grinned, showing the gap in her front teeth.</p>
<p>"I'm a big girl, Daddy!" she yelled happily. Then another thought struck her. </p>
<p>"Daddy? How do I stop?"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke woke with a start and rubbed her eyes, the dream, or rather memory still fresh in her mind.</p>
<p>&lt;Well, at least that one didn't hurt&gt; she thought wearily. &lt;I remember that the Johnson's yard was fairly soft when I landed in it. Dad was very apologetic that he forgot to show me the brakes&gt; She smiled. It was a happy memory that she didn't mind having back.</p>
<p>She hadn't told anyone aside from her therapist Natalie that she was having the memory flashes. Natalie saw them as a good thing, progress being made whether Brooke was trying or not. It was a sign that she was still healing and recovering. Natalie was also doing the best she could to help Brooke deal with her fear and subsequent anger as the walls within her psyche slowly broke down. She told Brooke to try and accept Mouse as simply another part of her personality and to try and integrate her the best that she could. But, it was easier said than done.</p>
<p>Brooke rolled over onto her side and sighed. She wished Sam was with her but they'd slept separately because the parents were home. While they knew that Jane knew about them, they still weren't into flaunting it in her face and they still weren't sure about Mike. Having him walk in on them curled up together might be rather awkward.</p>
<p>&lt;I'm pushing her away again&gt; Brooke scolded herself. She was aware that she was distancing herself from Sam again and hated herself for what was apparently an automatic reaction on her part. She was just so scared of what was happening to her that she wanted to curl up in a ball in some dark room and just stop. Just stop and let the world pass her by until she could figure things out. A day, a week, a year, whatever it took to straighten out her mind and memories. But she didn't have that luxury and she was panicking.</p>
<p>She swung her legs over the side of the bed and let her bare feet slip down to the floor. The trip across the room to the bathroom into Sam's room was familiar and well traveled. She paused in front of the mirrors in the bathroom and stared at herself with a critical eye. She was slightly in need of a haircut, but didn't really care. It hung in her eyes and she had a cowlick in back.</p>
<p>&lt;Ha. The old me would've flipped if her hair was this uneven&gt; she thought ruefully. Ignoring her unkempt appearance for the time being, she continued on to Sam's room. She found Sam asleep on her stomach, her blankets on the floor, a sure sign that Sam was having nightmares. Normally the young journalist slept on her right side or back and only resorted to her stomach and tossing blankets if distressed. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"What's bothering you, Sammy?" she whispered walking towards the bed. Sam didn't move, even as Brooke picked up the blankets and replaced them on the bed and over her sleeping form. Being careful not to wake the brunette, Brooke slipped in under the covers, needing Sam's presence to calm her own nerves. She pulled Sam onto her chest with only a small grunt of protest from the other girl. She stroked Sam's hair with her fingers and kissed the top of Sam's head.</p>
<p>"Guess we're both fighting some demons, huh, Sammy?" she asked rhetorically. Soon, Sam's rhythmic breathing and warm body lulled Brooke back into slumber.</p>
