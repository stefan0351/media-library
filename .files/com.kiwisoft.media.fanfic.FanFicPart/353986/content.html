<!-- The Closet \ Part Fourteen -->

<p>Brooke watched as Sam's hand slowly made its way down from her
collarbone to the swell of  her breast where it then dipped down even
further cupping the soft mound of flesh through her shirt and
squeezing gently.  Brooke's breath hitched, her eyes momentarily
fluttering closed as Sam touched her, her own hand anxiously sneaking
its way under Sam's shirt reveling in the feeling of Sam's warm skin
pressed against her hand.  Slowly, her hand trailed upward, taking
Sam's shirt with it, until Brooke's hand reached the underside of
Sam's breast which she then began to delicately explore.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam breathed out softly as she looked down at the blonde's
face.  Somehow, though she wasn't exactly sure how, after Brooke had
kissed her they had ended up falling down to the ground, Sam sitting
on Brooke's lap, straddling her.  That had been about fifteen minutes
ago, and since then they hadn't spoken a word to each other, their
only communication coming through the tiny sounds that they emitted
and the looks and touches that they exchanged.  But it had all come
so suddenly, and Sam was beginning to wonder if it was real, because
it seemed almost to good to be true; she needed Brooke to speak to
her, to tell her that this was actually happening.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes parted though they remained slightly hooded as she
raised her head up so that she could see Sam's face.  Brooke lifted
the hand that wasn't still under Sam's shirt to the brunette's face,
stroking her cheek softly with her thumb as a tender smile spread
across her lips.</p>

<p>"We need to talk," Sam said as she leaned into Brooke's touch.  To
her surprise the smile and Brooke's face only grew, her eyes
crinkling in the most adorable way as she continued to gaze at Sam.</p>

<p>"I think," the blonde finally said, shifting her position a bit so
that her face was closer to Sam's – a maneuver that was far more
complicated than it would seem at first since Sam was sitting on her –
 "that would be a…prudent course of action," she continued still
staring at Sam.</p>

<p>Sam nodded, but she was finding it very difficult to
concentrate.  "We should probably stop touching each other," she said
finally locating the source of her distraction.  Brooke looked away
for a moment, her eyes rolling up in head as if she were in deep
thought, and for a second Sam thought that she might protest, but the
blonde lowered her gaze a moment later watching as she extracted her
hand from Sam's shirt. </p>

<p>"That's better," Sam declared, "this will be much more helpful to the
talking."</p>

<p>Brooke, in response, raised her eyebrow at Sam, then looked down at
her lap while clearing her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh right," Sam muttered raising herself up and off of Brooke so that
she was sitting on the floor beside the blonde.  There they sat
together in an increasingly uncomfortable silence until finally Sam
spoke again – to both of their great relief.</p>

<p>"So," Sam started, but apparently she hadn't thought ahead very far
because she didn't add anything to that expect for an awkward head
bob.</p>

<p>"So," Brooke repeated in an equally uncomfortable fashion.  "We've
never done THAT before," she continued wincing as the words came out
of her mouth.  She didn't think that she could have been any lamer if
she had actually put effort into it.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam agreed, "the hand up the shirt was new," she continued
shaking her head.  If things continued like this she figured that the
rest of their stay in the closet was going to seem, very, very, very,
long.</p>

<p>Brooke looked over at her when she said that, an expression of worry
marring her features.  The blonde reached over and took her
hand.  "Sam," she started very seriously.  "despite the fondling, I
just totally want you to know that I respect you…you know as a
person, and not just as…"</p>

<p>"A sex-monkey?" Sam supplied helpfully.</p>

<p>"First I would like to say that that just gave me a very disturbing
visual," Brooke responded making a face, "and secondly, well yeah,"
she continued shrugging her shoulders rather helplessly.  "Not that
you're not sex-monkey material, I mean your totally sex-monkey
material, just not to me…not that I don't think of you in that way,
because, well, the fondling, just I wouldn't use the term sex-monkey,
because…"</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked interrupting the cheerleaders babbling.  "I get
it," she continued as a smile played across her lips.  She was beyond
charmed by the little display and it showed on her face.</p>

<p>"Good, cause I was starting to confuse myself," Brooke admitted
shaking her head ruefully.  "We're going to have to talk more than
this aren't we?" she asked a moment later as she turned to face Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded noticing with a touch of amusement how Brooke's
face fell, a pout forming on lips Sam now knew to be delicious.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have to tell you mine now aren't I?" Brooke asked
remembering how she had taunted Sam earlier.  Damn, she knew Sam was
going to make her pay for that, but impulse control hadn't been her
strongest attribute lately, so she decided that she shouldn't really
have been surprised that she did it anyway.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded smiling happily.  She planned on making Brooke
pay for taunting her earlier.  The cheerleader really should have
known better.</p>

<p>"You're not going to let me kiss you again until I tell you, are
you?" Brooke asked barely managing to keep her voice from sounding as
whiny as she was feeling.</p>

<p>"'Fraid not," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"Great," Brooke responded resigning herself to her fate.  "Are you
comfortable?  This could take a while."</p>

<p>"Not yet," Sam answered shifting a bit closer to Brooke and resting
her head on the blonde's shoulder.  "Now I'm good."</p>

<p>"Great," Brooke muttered.  "Where should I start?"</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Sam began thoughtfully.  "How about you tell me about the
time you first realized that you wanted my body," she suggested
happily a moment later.  Brooke sighed, this was going to be fun.</p>
