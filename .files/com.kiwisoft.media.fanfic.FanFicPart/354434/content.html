<!-- Empty Hate \ Part 4 -->

<p>Sam shuffled through her papers, angrily. Goddammit, she
muttered. Deadlines, goddamn awful no-good deadlines. And what's the
worst thing about deadlines? The word dead, which was exactly what
she would be if she didn't find her drug article for the newspaper.
Which incidentally was due tomorrow. `Where was I working on it?'Yes!
epiphany, glorious wonderful epiphany. `Living room, sofa,' she
muttered as she got up and ran to the living room to feel the rush of
disappointment, bitter and stinging flood through her veins. She got
down on her knees and lifted up one of the cushions. Ah ha! In the
corner, bunched into a little ball, was her paper. She grabbed it and
sat down on the ruffled couch and began to tenderly un-rumple it,
resisting just barely the urge to kiss it. Her smile dropped. Her
once beautiful, well thought out paper was now an unreadable well
thought out paper due to the very large purple stain looking
suspiciously like grape juice. And then Sam had another, but not so
glorious epiphany. She understood what it meant to see red. Her
vision was foggy and yet she felt remarkably clear-headed. She was
going to kill Brooke, who was the only person in the house who drank
grape juice. Ohh and it was going to hurt. Badly. For the last week
she had, oh god, been nice to Brooke. Sure, there had been those un-
sisterly and therefore awkward thoughts she had been having about
putting her hands on her in a very un-sisterly ways may have had
something to do with it, but nice it had been regardless. She had let
Brooke hog the T.V! She had even made her dinner, yes dinner, while
her parents were away at some art thing. All right, it had been fun
and she had left feeling all tingly...but now! Look at what she had
done. Wanton lesbian thoughts aside, somebody was going to pay.</p>

<p>Sam slowly stomped over to Brooke's room, and even stopped to
knock. All deaths that would have to occur would be done with a
civility of sorts. "Come in," a soft voice said. Sam opened the door
to see Brooke's lanky form sprawled across the bed, twirling a pencil
in one hand and looking unbelievably sexy, which Sam was too livid to
fully notice at the time. </p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam started in a tone so level and calm matched
with such an ambiguous expressions as to be scary, "how are you
doing?" Sufficient to say, she had captured Brooke's attention, and
her pencil stopped mid swirl. "Fine?' she said uncertainly,
sensing bad undertones. "And yourself?" she questioned tentatively.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not doing quite as well, considering that someone
who drinks gape juice spilled it all over my report and that same
someone forgot to at least tell me and that someone just it away and
now I am screwed!" Sam's voice had risen steadily until she was
shouting. Brooke's face had become completely pale and flushed at the
same time and she scooted back into the bed and ducked her face as if
maybe if she couldn't see Sam, then maybe Sam wouldn't be able to see
her. This just made Sam all the more furious, "You know, despite all
the crappy things you've done to me, for some ungodly reason, I
forgave you. But for what? What? Are you trying to sabotage my
writing? Imagine that for a little while I had actually thought I like
you!" </p>

<p>"Wait,' Brooke started, "what have I done to you, you
being the person who wrote editorials about me, insulted me, and now
you have the nerve to stand here and tell me that I `m the bad one.
What gives you the right?"</p>

<p>"How in the world can you pretend you are Little Miss Innocent?
Do you remember, say, when you stated dating Josh even though I had
just told you I liked him? I bet you don't even like him you, just did
it to hurt me."</p>

<p>Maybe it was the way Sam was shouting or maybe it was because the
words rang a little bit too true, but she snapped. "Well,
it's not like he would have ever gone out with you, Sam, you're only
like one of the most awful people I know. Who would ever date you?"
Sam snapped back like she had been physically slapped. Her eyes began
to tear but she closed them, promising herself she would never ever
cry in front of Brooke.</p>

<p>In a voice trembling with emotion, Sam said, "Don't speak to
me anymore" and she left, locking the door to her room when she got
there. `I can't believe I thought she was my friend. God, how
can I love somebody who thinks of me like, like somebody who's
horrible! No one will date me? Well let's just see about that.'
Sam picked up the phone and pressed speed dial, waiting through a
couple of rings before somebody picked up. </p>

<p>"Hey Harrison, it's Sam."</p>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile, Brooke sat in a stunned silence, the recent exchange
weighing heavily on her mind. Had Sam actually said that she liked
her? `Or used to,' she reminded herself. `Oh god, I
can't believe I... she probably hated me right now. Ironic much? I just
called her -the person who I can't help but look at and smile, the
person who sends shivers of warmth through me by a simple touch - a
horrible person. God, she's the best person I know! She goes out of
her way to be nice to everyone, she even brings me green mint tea
when I don't feel well, and that was when we were still enemies' She
could feel her words burning inside of her.</p>

<p>`The friendships gone,' she thought as a tear slowly trekked
its way down her cheek. </p>

<p>`Well, I might as well tell her how I feel.' She knew Sam
wouldn't be hurtful about it no matter how weirded out she was.
`Tomorrow,' she whispered into the pillow as she slipped under the
blankets, which were as bare and lonely as she felt.</p>

<hr>

<p>"She's what?!?" Brooke gasped in disbelief.</p>

<p>"Yea, I know it's pretty sick."</p>

<p>"But..., since when?"</p>

<p>"Well, since today, I think. Who really cares when the two losers
hooked up anyway,' Nic replied as she applied her bright pink lip
gloss, smacking her lips while staring at the mirror and then turning
to address Brooke. "I'm surprised you didn't know about
Spam and Harrison considering how you've been unfortunately trapped in
that living situation with her."</p>

<p>"Come on, let's just go to lunch."</p>

<p>Sitting across the table from Nicole and staring down at her tray,
she wondered why everything had gotten so bad so quickly. `Well,
at least it can't get any worse. I mean, she won't talk to me
and she has a boyfriend. Whatever bridge that was in the process of
being constructed between her and myself has been officially torched.
I might as well keep any feelings that I might have entertained to
myself.' With a certain masochistic edge Brooke turned her head
and stole a glance at where Sam was sitting. There she was, sitting
next to that brat, Harrison. She watched as Harrison leaned in close
to Sam and murmured something into here ear, and she continued to
watch as Sam's eyes lit up and she saw her erupt with giggles. `Oh
god,' Brooke thought to herself as she clenched her jaw. Now she was
being torn in two different directions: while one part of her wanted
to stomp over there, grab Harrison by the collar, pull him outside
and beat him up, another part of her just wanted to go over to Sam,
wrap her arms around her and lay her head in the crook of her neck,
whispering that she was sorry and smelling her perfume and...
"Hello, earth to Brooke," Josh joked as he sat down and kissed
Brooke on the cheek, and then noticing who she had been staring at,
went on to ask, So I guess you've herd of Sam and Harrison?"
At the mention of Sam's name, Brooke finally started paying
attention." Oh yeah, it's great, they make a really cute
couple," she replied as she stared down at her lunch and poked at a
huge pile of red jello with her fork.</p>

<p>"Good to here you say, since we're all going on a double date
on Friday."</p>

<p>And now, it finally got worse. "What!?!"</p>
