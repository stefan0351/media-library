<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Ten -->

<p>After getting settled in, and Brooke changed into dry clothes, they sat down to lunch enjoying the easy flowing banter flying between the two of them. Some comments were innocent, others plainly weren't but neither cared. It had been so long since they'd had a chance to sit down and talk without any interference that they were drinking in the opportunity. </p>
<p>As they talked, Sam watched Brooke's facial expressions. It was something she enjoyed doing when no one else was around. Sometimes she could tell more from the blonde cheerleader's face than she could with what Brooke actually said. When Brooke was really comfortable and happy, her face and eyes were an open book, conveying so many more emotions than she was probably aware of. And Sam loved it. </p>
<p>So as Brooke talked about this and that, and flirted (because Sam was sure now that that was what it was), Sam searched her face for a clue was to what was going on in the other girl's mind.</p>
<p>&lt;Is she just playing, being a friend? Because I know friends flirt with one another sometimes when they truly trust each other. It doesn't mean anything then. I shouldn't be reading more into it than that. I'm just torturing myself with what I can't have. It's just...I do love her. Very much&gt;</p>
<p>Brooke saw a shadow of what she could only call pain pass through Sam's eyes and wondered what caused it. She was watching Sam study her intently, enjoying the attention and the look of wonder on Sam's face until that point. </p>
<p>"You all right, Sam?" she asked, breaking Sam from her thoughts. Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"I'm fine. Why?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. You just looked like you...left for a second there," Brooke said softly.</p>
<p>"Sorry. Got caught up in a thought," she sighed. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"It's OK. So what do you want to do today? We still have plenty of time if you wanna hit the resort for some evening skiing or something in town," Brooke suggested.</p>
<p>"If it's OK with you, I think I'd just like to hang out here at the cabin. Get used to the place. Spend time with you," Sam finished in a low whisper. Brooke's breath caught in her throat at that statement.</p>
<p>"There's nothing I'd like more, Sammy," she responded also in a whisper. Sam smiled brightly at her. They grinned at each other like a couple of fools for several minutes.</p>
<p>"Well, help me clear the table and I'll give you a better tour of the place," Brooke finally said, breaking the comfortable silence.</p>
<p>"You got it."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"I can't freaking believe this! What do you mean DELAYED?" Nicole screamed at the ticket clerk. The clerk winced and sighed.</p>
<p>"Delayed. As in 'not on time', 'leaving at a later time', also as in, 'take a seat and get out of my face before I have security drag you out of here for the shear pleasure of watching'," the clerk responded, not at all impressed by Nicole's blustery attitude. Nicole huffed angrily and stormed back over to her seat in the waiting area next to Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Calm down, Nicole. Don't have a stroke," Lily said patiently. "We'll get there when we get there. Sam'll be surprised either way." Nicole glared intensely at the diminutive Latina.</p>
<p>"If I want your opinion, Lily, I'll give it to you," she snapped. Lily stuck out her tongue and went back to her magazine. </p>
<p>"Nic, yer drawin' attention ta yerself," Mary Cherry warned. </p>
<p>"I'm playing the part of jealous girlfriend, Mary Cherry," she hissed. She put her head back on the seat behind her and sighed.</p>
<p>"Damn it! They're alone up there. God knows what Brooke is filling her head with," she mumbled for only Mary Cherry to hear.</p>
<p>"Thoughts an' suggestions o' unpure actions an' unwanted sexual advances...touchin' yer Spammy in ways...makin' her arch inta her hands an'..."</p>
<p>"I'm going to hurt you if you don't shut up," Nicole warned lifting her head. Mary Cherry quietly went back to her copy of Vogue.</p>
<p>"Lily, something's up with Nicole," Carmen whispered. "Or rather, Nicole is UP to something." Lily nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, definitely. This whole trip thing smells fishy. I mean if Brooke wanted us to go, she would have invited us in the first place," Lily agreed.</p>
<p>"And yet you agreed to go now," Harrison pointed out from the next seat. Both girls glared at him.</p>
<p>"To keep Nicole from causing damage to Brooke or Sam," Carmen commented as explanation.</p>
<p>"Please," Harrison scoffed. "Nic is her girlfriend. She wouldn't harm Sam. And as for Brooke, why would she?" Carmen and Lily just rolled their eyes.</p>
<p>"Men, you have absolutely no clue, do you?" Lily said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Clue about what, honey?" Josh looked up from his Gameboy.</p>
<p>"I rest my case," Lily sighed.</p>
