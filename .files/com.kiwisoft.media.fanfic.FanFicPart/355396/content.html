<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Six -->

<p>&lt;I can't buy her jewelry. She doesn't wear that much. Sam is really a minimalist when it comes to accessories. And I can't buy her clothes. Our taste is just different enough for me to pick the wrong thing. Besides,&gt; Brooke fretted. &lt;With my luck, she'd misinterpret it as me trying to change her or something else equally as ridiculous&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;There has to be something else Sam has always wanted that I can get her. A dream that I can make come true. Everyone has unfulfilled wishes, even me. So there MUST be something Sam pines for&gt;</p>
<p>"Good morning, Brooke," Jane said as she entered the kitchen and found the teen deep in contemplation of her cornflakes.</p>
<p>"Hey Mom," Brooke answered absently as she twirled her spoon in what was now nothing more than soggy mush.</p>
<p>"Big test today?" Jane started cooking some eggs as she spoke to Brooke. Brooke shook her head and tried to join the conversation.</p>
<p>"Huh? What?" Jane laughed.</p>
<p>"I asked if you had a big test today. You seem to be really thinking about something," she explained. Brooke let out a frustrated huff of air through her teeth.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to get Sam for her birthday," she admitted. Jane's eyes lit up in understanding.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that all? Why didn't you just ask? I know there's some computer games and programs that she wants. I can make up a list of a few things," Jane offered. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, those things are great but not what I want. They're too impersonal. I want to get her something special, something meaningful," Brooke clarified. Jane thought that it was wonderful that Brooke was showing such an interest in Sam's birthday.</p>
<p>"That's very sweet of you, Brooke. Do you have ANY clue what that might be?"</p>
<p>"No, Mom. Isn't there ANYTHING she has ever wanted or something she's wanted to do that she's never had the chance to? THAT'S what I want to get for her."</p>
<p>"Why is it so important to you, Brooke?" Jane asked intrigued. It seemed desperately important to Brooke that she get just the right thing and Jane wanted to understand why. Not that she wasn't happy with the sentiment, but she was very curious as to Brooke's motivation. Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"It just is. We've gotten so close and she mentioned that sometimes she feels lost in the shuffle. I want her to know that her birthday IS important," Brooke said hastily to cover herself. She was afraid that Jane was getting suspicious about her feelings towards Sam and she couldn't have that. Especially not before Sam knew.</p>
<p>"OK, well," Jane nodded. "Let me think." She paused and shifted through her memories of her spirited daughter to try and find something to help Brooke. But given Sam's independent and guarded nature, it wasn't easy. Then, an old memory bobbed to the surface.</p>
<p>"I remember this one time when Sam was about 7, shortly before her father Joe got sick, he took her to a nearby resort to learn to ski. She loved it. The cold air, the speed, the rush as she went down the hill. And you know Sam. She wasn't satisfied with the bunny slope. Joe had to take her down the moderate hill and I remember he was terrified," Jane laughed at the memory. "But Sam was thrilled."</p>
<p>"Sounds like Sammy," Brooke laughed with her. Jane smiled wider and nodded.</p>
<p>"She loved it so much and was such a natural that Joe promised to take her to Telluride for her next birthday. But he got sick and never got the chance..." Brooke jumped up from her seat.</p>
<p>"That's perfect! Do you think she'd still be interested?"</p>
<p>"Probably. She mentions it every once in a great while, and loves to watch the skiing events in the Winter Olympics. But, Brooke, that's way too expensive," Jane tried to dissuade her. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, no it won't be. My mom's brother Eric works lives near Telluride and has a big cabin there. He's always said that anytime I wanted to use the cabin I was welcome and that he'd help me get vouchers and all that stuff. I'll just call and clear it with him. Yes! This is perfect!" she hugged Jane. "Thank you SO much, Mom."</p>
<p>"You're welcome, Brooke. I'm sure it'll mean a lot to her."</p>
<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>&lt;God, Spam's birthday is this week. I have to get her a good gift or I know that bitch Brooke will make me look bad by one-upping me. I could buy her some jewelry. Sam could use the help learning how to accessorize. Or I could buy her a whole new wardrobe. God knows she's got awful taste&gt; Nicole sighed. She hated sentimental occasions like birthdays, Valentine's, anniversaries, and the like. Not a lot of attention was paid to them in her family so she was at a loss as to how to deal with them.</p>
<p>&lt;Eh, I'll think of something. I always do. I'll just throw out some money and see where it lands. That's my biggest advantage over Brooke. Money solves all problems&gt; she smirked. &lt;Well, money and sex&gt; She turned to the person sitting beside her.</p>
<p>"Ready to go, hot stuff?" she asked seductively. A pair of green eyes sparkled back.</p>
<p>"When you are," his deep baritone answered back. Nicole took the guy's hand, Ben she thought his name was, and headed towards the door of the club. If there was one way to banish her growing feelings for Sam, it was to feel something else entirely.</p>
