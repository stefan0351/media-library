<hr size=1 noshade><p>Oh my God, she's in love with me. When did this happen? Why did this happen? What do I do?</p>
<p>I guess I should start from the beginning. My name is Lilly Truscott and I'm 17. I live in Southern California. There are very few people in this world that I care about outside of my family. Oliver is one of them. He's been my best friend since I can remember. We've stuck together like glue over the years. For most of our lives, we've had to look out for each other because, let's face it, we aren't the most popular kids on the planet. We were all each other had in school. Well, that is, until Miley moved into town.</p>
<p>Miley Stewart moved in next door to me about two years ago. We immediately hit it off. Unfortunately, so did her and Oliver. Ugh, they started dating. Something about that couple just didn't sit right with me. That was the worst three months of my life. Anyway, besides that very short fiasco, Miley and I have been inseparable. We practically live together. I spend most of my time at her house and when I'm not at hers, she's at mine. We just, mesh, y'know?</p>
<p>So today, I came over here to work on some lame project for history class. Miley went downstairs to get us some food. Well, I went to lie down and, being my clumsy self, fell off the bed. Before I had a chanced to stand up, I saw a book under Miley's bed. Instead of leaving it alone, as I probably should have, I grabbed it. It was a small book with flowers on it. At the top of the cover in small letters it read: MY DIARY.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is the part where I should've put it right back under her bed without ever looking inside.</p>
<p>If I'd done that, I wouldn't be freaking out right now.</p>
<p>No, instead I figured it wouldn't hurt to just read a little. I started at the first page.</p>
<p><i>Dear Diary,</i></p>
<p><i>This is my first entry in here. I just need a place to put my thoughts down. Well, here's the thing…I think I'm gay.</i></p>
<p>…oh, it gets better…</p>
<p><i>I don't know when all this started…I mean I'd always kinda had small crushes on girls but I never really thought about it. I just thought it was because my only exposure to boys has been Jackson…and there's no way in hell I ever want a guy if it means having one anything like him.</i></p>
<p><i>The thing is…there's this girl that I met about a week ago. She's…well…she's different. She's just…ugh…it's hard to describe. I just find myself always trying to say the right thing around her and my mind always wanders to her. Her name is Lilly…like the flower (which I think is adorable…which is scary…) I don't know, it might be nothing…but if it does, it might change everything.</i></p>
<p>Yeah…um…yeah. I read it, like, five times to make sure that I'd read it right. Finally, after I'd convinced myself that my eyes weren't lying to me, I just sat there in shock. I didn't know what to think, so I figured, this was written a long time ago. This was written even before her and Oliver started dating. I figured the only logical thing to do was to find an entry when they'd been dating. I was sure that it would say how much she liked Oliver and how much she was not gay. Because Miley couldn't be gay. It just…no.</p>
<p><i>Dear Diary,</i></p>
<p><i>Oliver is so sweet. He bought me flowers today. Part of me loves the attention. Part of me feels guilty for wishing he was Lilly. I mean, Oliver has been nothing but a fantastic person and I'm basically just using him to get closer to Lilly…which probably isn't the best idea because I'm pretty sure that she's into him. She always just looks really sad when we're together. I want to break up with Oliver, but I'm scared of what might happen if I do. First off, I'd probably lose Oliver as a friend and I'd hate that. He's a fantastic guy and I don't want to hurt him. Then (and this is the worst thing that could possibly happen), Lilly would probably tell Oliver how she feels and they'd get together. I wouldn't be able to take that. Ugh…saying yes to Oliver was the worst idea EVER! I'm a horrible person…<br>
</i></p>
<p>Okay…at this point, my mind was in full overdrive. I just couldn't believe it! I just kept telling myself that this had to have been a phase that she went through. If I read the most recent update, it wouldn't say anything even close to her having feelings for me. It wasn't possible. I turned to the last page with writing on it.</p>
<p><i>Dear Diary,</i></p>
<p><i>I'm so happy! Lilly is coming over later today. We have to work on a history project together. We haven't hung out in a couple days, so I'm looking forward to it. I don't know if I'm ever going to have the nerve to tell her how I feel. She would flip if I told her I'm in love with her. Then she'd probably tell Oliver, who would also flip, and my dad…I don't think "flip" is the right word to describe what my dad's reaction would be. I probably wouldn't have a place to live if he ever found out. In my best dreams, Lilly feels the same way, but I know that's not how it would really be. Actually, in my best dreams, Lilly's on my bed-</i></p>
<p>I slammed the book shut, put it back under the bed, and went to leave. Unfortunately, Miley was standing in the doorway. She looked horrified.</p>
<p>"Please tell me you weren't just reading that."</p>
<p>"Um…" I said. Well, I couldn't lie; she'd obviously seen me with it. "I didn't read that much."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you read enough." There was this painfully awkward silence. "Lilly, I didn't want you to find out this way, but we might as well talk-"</p>
<p>"Y'know, I have to go. Yeah, my mom's been getting pissed off about me being gone so much lately. I'll see you around okay?"</p>
<p>Okay, admittedly, that was dumb and obviously a lie, but I had to leave. There was no way I was ready to have that conversation. It was too much. I ran past her and ignored her as she called after me.</p>
<p>Now, I'm running aimlessly down the street with tears in my eyes, knowing that Miley was balling her eyes out back at her house. I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do when I see her in school tomorrow.</p>
