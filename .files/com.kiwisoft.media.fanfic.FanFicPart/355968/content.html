<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 9 -->

<p>Tom returned to his quarters after he had his conversation with Seven.  He decided to grab a shower and head to the holodeck to relieve some of the tension he had built up trying to be a stand up guy.  He threw his uniform in the recycler and walked into the bathroom.  After his shower he was brushing his hair in the mirror when he caught his own eyes in the reflection.  He stared at his face for long moments.  He heard his father's disapproving voice echoing in his mind.  Telling him what a colossal disappointment he'd always been, what a disgrace to the family name.  </p>

		<p>"What do you want to be when you grow up?"  He demanded of his reflection.   "A grown up," he answered with a melancholy laugh.</p>

		<p>He continued to look at himself in the mirror, and realized just how long it had been since he'd even been able to look himself in the eyes.  He was sick of it...he was sick of himself.  It disgusted him that he had turned himself into exactly what his father had predicted he'd become.  He was tired of his father always being right.</p>

		<p>"It is time to grow up Tom."</p>

		<p>Still wearing only his damp towel he walked out to the living room and flopped down onto the couch.  He dropped his head into his hands and began to review the dismal mess he'd made of his life so far.  He'd been given a second chance here on Voyager, but he'd only partly taken advantage of it.  He knew he was an incredible pilot, but he also knew he cut corners with paperwork and protocol whenever he thought he could. He could have started again in his personal life and he hadn't.  He'd frittered away time and relationships and driven away B'Elanna, damaging her life in the process.  He got up and went back into the bedroom after he replicated a fresh uniform.  This time when he looked in the mirror, he looked himself squarely in the eyes.</p>

		<p>"If anyone is going to fall on their sword over this it's going to be you, not B'Elanna," he told himself as he straightened up his collar and pips.</p>

		<p>He contacted Captain Janeway and she agreed to meet him in her ready room in fifteen minutes. He walked toward the door, then stopped and went back into the bathroom.  He picked the damp towel up off the floor and hung it on the rack, straightening it out neatly before turning to leave.  He was two minutes early to his meeting...it was a first.  When Janeway called him in he stood in front of her desk at rigid attention.</p>

		<p>"What's going on Tom?" she asked, wondering what was happening with her usually lax helmsman.</p>

		<p>"I have something to tell you, and you really aren't going to be happy about it," Tom replied.</p>

		<p>"I'm listening."</p>

		<p>"It's about B'Elanna, and what's going on with her these days."  Janeway said nothing, waiting for him to continue.  "She, uh...she found out some things about me...things I'd been doing behind her back.  She, uh...she caught me cheating on her with a hologram, and it really devastated her Captain.  We had a huge fight and she broke up with me, and I said some really hurtful things to her.  I know she's been having some trouble lately, but it really isn't her fault.  I'd hate to see her punished for something I'd done."  He finished in a rush and then stood silently waiting for Janeway to speak.</p>

		<p>"While I can't say as I blame B'Elanna for breaking up with you, or for having difficulties accepting your behaviour, that hardly excuses her outrageous actions over the last few weeks."</p>

		<p>"Captain, I really hurt her, and I damaged her honour.  I, uh, I also did whatever I could to mess up her friendship with Seven, and it worked too...they aren't even speaking any longer, and I think that's really what's really messing her up; she has nobody to even talk to thanks to me.  I'd really appreciate it if you'd give her another chance.  I spoke to Seven and I'm hoping they can work it out.  I'll do whatever it takes Captain...extra duties, um, brig time, whatever you need."</p>

		<p>"I'm curious as to what brought on this bout of extremely altruistic behaviour," Janeway demanded after a long moment of silence, not certain what to make of Tom's aberrant behaviour.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna said some things to me when we broke up.  It took a while but they finally sunk in.  I...I think its time I made some changes in my life," he finished with a rueful smile.</p>

		<p>"It sounds like it may be Tom."  Janeway paused before continuing.  "I'll take what you said under advisement when I make my decision about what to do with B'Elanna.  In the meantime you can spend the next few shifts scrubbing the aft plasma conduits instead of relaxing on the bridge.</p>

		<p>"Yes Sir!" Tom replied with conviction.  All things considered she'd let him off easy.</p>

		<p>"Dismissed."</p>

		<p>Tom was almost out the door when he paused.  "Captain...I wouldn't mention to B'Elanna that I spoke to you about his.  She already feels like her honour has been compromised.  It would kill her to think that I spoke to you on her behalf."</p>

		<p>"Dismissed Tom," Janeway's voice was curt, but in truth she was impressed by Tom's sensitivity.  She only hoped he was sincere this time, and that his conviction lasted longer than a week or two.  Time would tell.  She decided to let B'Elanna sweat it out a little longer in her quarters before she went down to speak to her.</p>

		<p>As Tom made his way back to his quarters he made another decision.  When he got there he replicated a bouquet of roses.  He'd always really liked Ensign Mallaley, but he'd never gone beyond some harmless flirtation.  Maybe it was time he put his heart on the line.  As he was on his way out the door he stopped.</p>

		<p>"Computer, delete file 'Paris Nights' authorization code Alpha 117."</p>

		<p>&lt;File deleted&gt;</p>

		<p>"Computer, delete file 'Chaotica's Harem' authorization code Alpha 117."</p>

		<p>&lt;File deleted&gt;</p>

		<p>He took another step, and stopped once more.</p>

		<p>"Computer, delete holocharacter 'Ricky' authorization code Alpha 117."</p>

		<p>&lt;Holocharacter deleted&gt;</p>

		<p>"So this is what it feels like to be a grownup."  He smiled to himself and headed out the door.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>B'Elanna was pacing in her quarters.  She couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.  She knew she'd messed up big time with this last fight.  She didn't have a problem with any of the people she'd been fighting with, but sometimes she just couldn't contain the anger inside of her...it eased her pain and helped her to forget everything she'd lost when she let her anger flare.  The physical pain she experienced masked the deep emotional pain she was so tired of feeling.  She'd been screwing up for weeks now, spent time in the brig, and no matter how hard she tried to straighten up, she just couldn't seem to manage to pull herself together.  Despite that, Janeway had just come down to her quarters and informed her that she was to be confined to her quarters for two days, at which point she was to return to duty for her last chance to save her job.  Janeway had cited the outstanding circumstances in her personal life as her reasoning for her leniency.  It just didn't make any sense.  She'd broken up with Tom, but that hardly qualified as outstanding circumstances, and there was no way Janeway could know about what had happened between her and Seven. She shook her head for the hundredth time and went back to her pacing.  She had spent the majority of her adult life on board starships, and for the most part she wouldn't change it for anything.  She wasn't like some of the other crew who longed for fresh air and planet side leave, but right now she'd give anything to be able to go outside and walk in a cold hard rain...real rain...not some computer generated simulation.  She needed to feel clean again.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Seven had heard through the ship's gossip channels that B'Elanna was confined to her quarters for two days, and that the Captain had given her an ultimatum...straighten up or ship out.  She was sincerely hopeful that B'Elanna would be able to pull herself together and go back to being the engineer she truly was.  In truth she had thought of little but B'Elanna since Tom Paris had left Astrometrics.  What if B'Elanna really could forgive her...what if they still had a chance?  But every time she thought that, her logical brain immediately contradicted itself.  The look on B'Elanna's face the last time they spoke...there was no forgiveness there.  B'Elanna would never speak to her again...at least not as a friend, and certainly not as a lover.  It was almost as if her cortical node was caught in some kind of loop, vacillating wildly between hope and despair.  She was paralyzed with fear and her own inability to make a decision to act and determine her future on her own terms.  The two day confinement was like a reprieve to her...two more days before she once again saw B'Elanna, a single B'Elanna, free to love her if she chose, and free to reject her if she desired.  Two days of hope and despair.  She wasn't sure she could do it.</p>

		<p>The two days passed in a blur for Seven...she could hardly concentrate on her work.  Her emotions were in overdrive and she simply wasn't equipped to handle them.  It was ironic that the one thing she needed to get through this was the one thing she couldn't have.  If only she could talk to her friend B'Elanna she knew she would feel better.  B'Elanna had a way of calming her down and letting her deal with things, putting them in perspective.  But her friend B'Elanna was the reason she was feeling this way, and even if she weren't confined to quarters, she certainly wouldn't want to help out anymore...not after the things Seven had said.  The beautiful blond couldn't believe that she was actually looking back at her ordeal in the nebula and thinking fondly of that time...at least then she had had a version of B'Elanna to rely on...now she was truly alone.</p>
