<p><u>Crewman's Corridor Deck 8</u></p>
		<p>Kathryn rushed out of the Delaney's quarters. Suddenly she felt very sober.</p>
		<p>` Shit, what have I done Shit shit shit' She thought. Kathryn looked left then right, she saw pink checked PJs walking around the corner. Kathryn ran to catch up " Sammy please wait"</p>
		<p>Samantha Wildman stopped in her tracks. Kathryn caught up to her; She put her hands on her Sam's shoulders and gently turned her around. </p>
		<p>She was met with tears streaming down Samantha's face. Kathryn brought her hands up and gently wiped away the tears " I am so sorry Sam, I guess I got caught up in the moment"</p>
		<p>"I am not sorry Kathryn. I am.. I am Oh god I don't know what I am, confused I guess, shit no I  I god, Kathryn I've never felt this alive" </p>
		<p>Kathryn pulled Sam close and whispered "Me too"</p>
		<p>Sam nuzzled into Kathryn's neck.</p>
		<p>Kathryn felt the blood rush to places that she thought were dormant all these years.</p>
		<p>"Sammy we need to get out of the corridor"</p>
		<p>"Oh umm Naomi and Neelix are shit sorry Kathryn" </p>
		<p>"shh Its ok Sammy we could go to my quarters"</p>
		<p>Samantha sighed and held on to Kathryn " I am Drunk I" a single tear fell down Sam's cheek. "I wanted it to be special.. our first"</p>
		<p>Kathryn whisper interrupted "I mean to talk Sammy, I don't want you to think I am anything but honorable" she laughed softly.</p>
		<p>"Oh My I am sorry I just thought shit" sniffed Sam</p>
		<p>"Its ok Sammy, come on lets go" Kathryn took Samantha's hand and softly kissed it.</p>
		<p>They walked hand in hand back to Kathryn's quarters.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna looked out of the Delaney's door; she didn't want any one to see her leave. But most of all she didn't want anyone to see her leave with Seven, a very drunk amorous Seven.</p>
		<p>"Ok Seven lets go" B'Elanna took hold of Seven's waist and hand and directed her towards her own quarters. Seven would not budge.</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna Torres I will not go unless" Seven smiled wickedly "Unless you kiss me passionately again"</p>
		<p>"Ok Seven. But not here, how about your quarters"</p>
		<p>Seven pouted " Ok Bella" </p>
		<p>B'Elanna thought she would die ` Shit she is so gorgeous' she smiled `she is going to remember the kiss'</p>
		<p>Seven put her head on B'Elanna's shoulder as they walked towards her quarters.</p>
		<p>"You are so beautiful B'Elanna Torres" Seven kissed B'Elanna's neck.</p>
