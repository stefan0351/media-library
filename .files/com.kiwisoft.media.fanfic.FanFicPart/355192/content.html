<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Crisis Point -->

<p>The next three weeks passed with both couples in a state of
happy bliss. Lily and Nicole continued to grow closer, still getting to know one
another as their relationship deepened and Sam and Brooke enjoyed their time
together. Their relationship had taken the turn towards intimate a week earlier
and neither regretted the change. Mike and Jane had gone on a trip and it just
sort of naturally progressed one night while they were alone. They hardly spent
a night apart although it was going to be more difficult when their parents
returned in a few days. </p>
<p>Sam was presently trying to get her breathing back under
control as she returned to her body. Brooke was grinning down at her.
</p>
<p>"Hey," Brooke purred. Sam stretched her body against Brooke's. </p>
<p>"Hey yourself," Sam whispered back. Brooke gave her a long and
deep kiss. They snuggled closer together. "I love you," Sam said. </p>
<p>"I love you too," Brooke responded. They started to drift off,
both spent from their activities. A frantic knock at the door woke Sam an hour
later. She looked down at Brooke who was still asleep and carefully removed
herself from the bed. She wrapped her robe around herself and padded down the
stairs. The knocking grew louder. </p>
<p>"Sam, who is it?" Brooke asked groggily from the top of the
stairs. Sam looked back at her. </p>
<p>"I dunno, hon, go back to bed," she said as she looked out the
window. Brooke stayed at the top of the stairs. (Who would be at the door at
three in the morning?) she wondered. </p>
<p>"Nicole?" Sam gasped as she opened the door. On the doorstep
was Nicole, distraught and crying. "Jesus, what's wrong?" Brooke came flying
down the stairs as Nicole collapsed in Sam's arms sobbing. She shut the door as
Sam led Nicole to the couch. </p>
<p>"Nicole, what's wrong? Is Lily OK?" Sam asked worriedly.
Nicole sniffed and nodded. </p>
<p>"She's fine. I'm so sorry, I had no where else to go," Nicole
cried. Brooke turned on the light and both she and Sam gasped. There was a livid
bruise on Nic's face. </p>
<p>"God, Nic, what happened?" Brooke asked. Nicole looked at her
sadly. </p>
<p>"Mom knows," she whined. "Somehow the harpy found out and
hired some private dick to follow me and Lily around. She's got pictures and
everything else. She confronted me about it after a bender and it got physical.
Then she threw me out. I couldn't go to Lily's so I came here. I'm sorry." </p>
<p>"It's OK, Nic," Brooke assured her while hugging the upset
girl. Meanwhile Sam seethed. As much as she didn't like Nicole, no one deserved
to be treated like that. Nic noticed both girls' state of undress and blushed. </p>
<p>"Did I interrupt something?" she asked with a slight grin.
Both girls tightened their robes. </p>
<p>"We were asleep, Nic. It IS three in the morning," Sam said
defensively. Nicole laughed. </p>
<p>"I wished I glowed like that when I first woke up," she joked.
Sam groaned and stood up. </p>
<p>"I'm gonna go get an ice pack for your face. Be right back,"
she muttered as she walked to the kitchen. Nicole turned to Brooke. </p>
<p>"You and Sam have taken the next step, huh?" she asked to take
attention off herself. Brooke blushed. </p>
<p>"Uh, yeah," she admitted. Nicole looked at her intently. </p>
<p>"What's it like?" she asked. Brooke blinked at her in shock. </p>
<p>"Huh?" </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, WAY out of line. Forget I asked," Nicole withdrew
the question and looked away in embarrassment for even asking. Brooke smiled at
Nicole's sudden discomfort. </p>
<p>"It's special, Nic. You and I have both slept with guys. I
have to tell you, it's different. But if you truly love Lily, it'll be
absolutely amazing," she said softly as Sam came back into the room, ice pack in
hand. </p>
<p>"Here, Nic, this should keep the swelling down," she said as
she handed it to Nicole. </p>
<p>"Thanks," Nic said as she placed the pack on her eye.
</p>
<p>"What happened exactly?" Sam asked. Nic sighed. </p>
<p>"Mom came home, drunk, woke me up and started flinging
accusations at me. She showed me pictures of Lily and I, and a few of the two of
you and asked me if I was gay. Since she had the proof in live Kodak color, I
said yes, and she flipped. She hit me and threw me out," Nic said giving them
the abrieviated version. The real one actually involved a lot of screaming,
cursing and took two hours. It wasn't pretty. </p>
<p>"God, Nic, I'm so sorry," Brooke said sadly. Nic shrugged. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, maybe once she sobers up I can talk to her. In
the meantime, watch your backs that she doesn't go after you. And I don't
suppose I could crash here tonight?" </p>
<p>"Sure, we got plenty of room," Brooke said. </p>
<p>"Just call and tell Lily what's going on in the morning," Sam
advised. Nic nodded. </p>
<p>"Thanks guys. I knew I could count on you." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily sat holding Nicole while they were all gathered in the
McQueen livingroom weighing their options later that day. Since killing Nicole's
mother wasn't viable, they were going to have to find another solution.
</p>
<p>"Maybe we should just talk to her, Nic," Lily offered. Nic
laughed bitterly. </p>
<p>"I tried that, Lil. I ended up with a black eye. Besides,
she's not only upset that I'm gay, but she's having trouble with the fact that
I'm involved with, and these are her words, not mine, a `piece of welfare
scamming, shoplifting, trailer park Latin trash'," Nicole pointed out. Lily
winced. There was a stereotype all layed out for everyone to see. </p>
<p>"Well, if she's going to insult me, she should at least get it
right. Latino's don't live in trailer parks, we live in the PJ's," Lily said
humorlessly. Actually, she wasn't on welfare, didn't shoplift and lived in a
very nice house but who was keeping score at this point? </p>
<p>"Oh, this is getting so messed up," Sam sighed. She wanted to
slap Nicole's mother into next week for the trouble the woman was causing but
kept her feelings to herself. </p>
<p>"So what do we do about it?" Brooke wondered. </p>
<p>"Not much we can do until she calms down," Nic said. "Then I
guess I can try talking again. From a safe distance, of course." </p>
<p>"I'll go with you," Lily said firmly. Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"Uh-uh, no way! I'm not letting that psycho nutjob near you.
She's liable to call the police or INS," Nicole said in a mild panic. Lily
raised an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Nicole, my family is from California. I can't be deported,"
she said wryly. "Unless sending us back to Carmel is considered deportation. And
what could I possibly be arrested for? Corruption of an impressionable youth?
Please." </p>
<p>"Trust me, she could think of something," Nicole warned. </p>
<p>"How about we all go?" Brooke said. "She can't possibly take
us all out, could she?" </p>
<p>"With a high powered rifle maybe," Sam interjected.
</p>
<p>"Sam!" Brooke scolded. </p>
<p>"Sorry." </p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sure she'd love that, Brooke. She throws her gay
daughter out only to have her return with the Rainbow Brigade. Jesus, the old
bat would probably have a stroke," Nicole scoffed. "On second thought, that
might not be such a bad idea." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The four girls arrived at the house later that afternoon and
Nicole nervously unlocked the door. They found her mother in the dining room
almost like she was waiting for them. She glared at them murderously.
</p>
<p>"Get out of my house," Mrs. Julian (who we'll call Gayle since
the author doesn't remember her actual name) growled. The four girls stood their
ground. </p>
<p>"Not until you listen to what your daughter has to say," Lily
said. Gayle glared at her. </p>
<p>"I have no daughter. That, `thing', is adopted, thank God, and
no actual blood relation." Nicole winced. She hated being so brutally reminded
of that fact. On the other hand, it was a relief to know she didn't actually
share any DNA with this woman. </p>
<p>"Have a seat, Mrs. Julian, cuz we're not going anywhere," Sam
stated flatly. </p>
<p>"I'll call the police," Gayle threatened. </p>
<p>"And say what? `My gay daughter is threatening to talk to
me'?" Sam asked mockingly. "First off, you'd be letting everyone know Nic's
secret, second, they'd laugh at you for the wasting the phone call." </p>
<p>"You all make me sick," Gayle spat angrily. "Do your parents
know what you are?" </p>
<p>"I'm a cheerleader," Brooke spoke up looking at Sam with a
shrug. </p>
<p>"I'm a journalist," Sam added, catching Brooke's vibe. Lily
smiled. </p>
<p>"I'm an activist," Lily put in her two cents. </p>
<p>"I'm a bitch but you knew that," Nicole pointed out. Gayle's
face turned red. </p>
<p>"You know what I mean," she hissed. The four girls looked at
each other. </p>
<p>"Why don't you refresh our memories," Brooke suggested.
</p>
<p>"Homosexuals," Gayle whispered as though saying it would
convert her. </p>
<p>"Oh," all four girls chorused unintentionally. They all had to
work to surpress the giggles. </p>
<p>"This is not funny," Gayle scolded. </p>
<p>"No, it's not," Nicole agreed, turning her attention back to
her mother and the matter at hand. "What is your problem Mother? Is it that I'm
gay or that I love Lily?" Gayle glared. </p>
<p>"Both. It's not normal and that," she pointed at Lily, "is so
far beneath you it's disgusting." Nicole's face turned red with rage.
</p>
<p>"Her name is Lily, like the flower. Repeat after me, Li-ly!"
she screamed. </p>
<p>"You're better than she is!" Gayle continued to rant. "You are
a Julian, maybe not by birthright but you were raised as one. You are better
than that piece of that trash." Lily, Brooke and Sam were watching the exchange
in silence. </p>
<p>"She is not trash!" Nicole argued. "She is a far better person
than you'll ever be, than you could ever HOPE to be!" </p>
<p>"Don't you take that tone with me, young lady," Gayle warned.
Nicole huffed. </p>
<p>"Or what? You'll hit me again? Take your best shot! God, why
is this so hard for you to accept?" </p>
<p>"Do you have any idea what this will do to my reputation?"
Gayle asked enraged. Nicole rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"YOUR reputation? I'm the one who's gay, not you!" </p>
<p>"This will ruin me!" Gayle countered. </p>
<p>"Geeze, Mom, this is L.A., there's no such thing as a closet
anymore. No one is going to shun you because your daughter is gay. No one is
going to care," Nicole said much calmer now. </p>
<p>"I won't accept this," Gayle declared. "And I'm going to
inform all your parents." </p>
<p>"Hey!" Sam broke in. Brooke's mouth hung open. </p>
<p>"You can't!" Lily argued. </p>
<p>"Mom!" Nicole scolded. "That's not right, or fair. It's none
of your business." </p>
<p>"They have a right to know the depths of depravity their
daughters have sunk to." </p>
<p>"We're not doing anything wrong," Brooke stated firmly. "Sam
and I love each other and Lily loves Nicole who loves her back. I think you have
some issues of your own." </p>
<p>"How dare you?" Gayle growled. </p>
<p>"How dare you?" Sam countered. "How dare you treat your
daughter like something evil and then butt your skinny ass nose into someone
else's business? If you can't deal with your own family, you have no right
stirring up someone else's." </p>
<p>"Get out of my house before I call the police." </p>
<p>"Go ahead," Lily finally spoke up. "Call the police and tell
them how your daughter is gay and trying to talk to you. How she's trying to get
you to see that she's still the same person you raised. She hasn't changed,
nothing has. So she loves me and not some buff California guy, so what? Maybe
that doesn't jive with a lot of what society says is right, again, so what? Mrs.
Julian, treating your daughter the way you are isn't right. Hitting her, abusing
her isn't right. If anyone here is evil, it's you." </p>
<p>"You smart mouthed little Spic," Gayle snapped. Lily's face
turned red. </p>
<p>"You narrow minded, homophobic, racist, asshole!" Nicole put
her arms around Lily to calm her, she didn't like seeing her this upset.
Suddenly, a new idea occurred to Nicole. </p>
<p>"You know what? You'd better keep your mouth shut Mom, you
know why? If you blab all over town that the four of us are gay and throw me out
on my ear, then I'll tell everyone how you beat me. And not just this once
either," Nicole threatened. Gayle's face paled. Nicole smiled ferally as she
realized she hit her mother's weak point. </p>
<p>"How do you think that would come across? Your high society
friends could probably deal with me being gay but how do you think they'd handle
knowing that you were an alcoholic child abuser, huh?" Nic taunted. "Or I could
spill some OTHER family secrets." </p>
<p>"You wouldn't," Gayle hissed. Nic arched an eyebrow. She knew
she'd just won. </p>
<p>"Try me." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Stalemate," Sam stated later as she cuddled with Brooke on
their couch. Brooke lazily ran her hands through Sam's hair. She nodded.
</p>
<p>"Yup," she agreed. Sam buried her face in Brooke's shirt,
inhaling the other girls scent. </p>
<p>"That woman is a harpy," Sam pointed out, her voice slightly
muffled by Brooke's shirt. </p>
<p>"Yes, she is," Lily agreed from her seat on Nic's lap on the
armchair. It hadn't ended pretty, but Nicole's mother had reluctantly agreed to
let Nicole come home. Lily was no longer allowed near the house and Nic was not
even to mention the other girls' name in her mother's presence. But Gayle
couldn't risk exposing the four girls without Nicole exposing the family secrets
so her hands were tied. It was one crisis averted. For now. </p>
<p>"You two are so cute it's disgusting," Nicole groaned to
Brooke and Sam. Both girls stuck out their tongues at the shorter blonde.
</p>
<p>"You two are cute too," Brooke said sweetly. Sam giggled. </p>
<p>"And so well matched height-wise," she added with a lopsided
smirk. Nicole threw a pillow at the brunette journalist. </p>
<p>"Very funny, Spam," Nic grumbled as Lily tried not to laugh.
Sam looked way too satisfied with herself. </p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke broke in, "What are we going to tell our
parents?" Sam groaned. </p>
<p>"Nothing, for now. I really don't relish the idea of telling
them, Brooke," she said honestly. </p>
<p>"Eventually, all our parents will have to know the truth,"
Lily said solemnly. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I know. But for now, let's just enjoy what we have and worry
about tomorrow when it gets here." </p>
