<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 33 -->

<p>Sam breezed into the house barely seeing.  She felt light-headed, the
ground under her feet felt like it was shifting, the air around her
shimmering.  She hardly felt stable and half expected to tip over at
any given minute.  There was no sound, and everything seemed warmer
for some reason, blurry and intrusive.</p>

<p>"Why are you home so early?" Jane asked sticking her head out of
kitchen when she heard the door open.</p>

<p>"Half day," Sam heard herself say.  She was impressed, apparently
lying came naturally to her.</p>

<p>"Where's Brooke?" Jane asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know, she doesn't exactly leave me photocopies of her day
book," Sam responded in a rather biting tone.  Her head hurt, she
wanted to go lay down, she wanted to strip down and run through the
woods — if there were any woods in L.A. that was.</p>

<p>"Sam," Jane stated.  Her voice was reproachful and a little bit
hurt.  She was getting a little tired of daughters mood swings.  One
day she's says she fine, the next she's hiding in her room or biting
peoples heads off.  </p>

<p>"I'm sorry.  Okay?" Sam said.  But she didn't sound the least bit
sorry, and things were obviously not okay.  Jane didn't respond to
abrasive offering, instead simply looking at Sam inquisitively.
Seeing this look on her mothers face—a look she had become annoyingly
used to—Sam sighed and rolled her eyes muttering, "I'll be upstairs."</p>

<p>Sam squeezed her eyes shut, holding them tightly together as she
paced the length of floor.  She shook her head from side to side
groaning pathetically as the scene from the cafeteria played itself
in her head over and over again, mocking her, teasing her.  She
pinched the bridge of her nose and continued to pace, she was certain
that she was muttering something, but if her life depended on it she
wouldn't have been able to say what.  For the past hour the entire
world seemed to have been muted, everything had lost its luster, she
was walking in a land of murky water colours.</p>

<p>She barely registered the door opening.</p>

<p> "You're mom said you were up…" Brooke started in a hurry breezing
into the room, pausing only when she saw Sam apparently trying to
make a hole in her carpet.  "Here," she finished softly, her eyes
never leaving Sam's form as she locked the door with her right hand.</p>

<p>Almost immediately she crossed the small distance separating them.
Coming up behind Sam, she wrapped her arms around her in what she
hoped was a comforting gesture stopping, at least for the moment,
Sam's insane cycle of pacing.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Brooke said in a small voice, head dipped down.  "I
thought…I mean we had talked about…"</p>

<p>Sam shook her head.  "I just never actually thought…" she started,
trailing off, shaking her head some more.  She had thought that they
were just talking out of their asses when they had come up with this
particular contingency plan.  When coming up with an plan, particular
or not, most people talked out of their asses.</p>

<p>"Neither did I," Brooke responded truthfully.  "I…at the time it just
seemed like the thing to do," she tried to explain lamely.  The truth
was it had just seemed like the right thing, the only thing, to do at
the time.  She just couldn't explain the thought process, or
processes, that had brought her to that conclusion now.  Hindsight
was bitch and it had just up and slapped her.</p>

<p>Sam didn't respond verbally, in fact Brooke couldn't even be sure
that the brunette had heard her.  Instead, Sam merely leaned back,
snuggling into Brooke's willing arms even further.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking?"  Brooke asked finally.  She had to talk, if
for no other reason than maintaining her own sanity.  She did not
want anymore silence, silence was no longer a friend of hers.</p>

<p>"Everything.  Nothing.  I don't know.  I'm all jumbled," Sam
responded haltingly.  She stumbled over her words, raising her voice
at the end of them making them sound like questions.  It was like
they didn't quite feel right coming out of her mouth, as if they
didn't quite roll of the tongue like they used to.</p>

<p>Brooke was quiet for a moment, then said, "I shouldn't have…I don't
know what I was thinking.  Mary Cherry was all…"</p>

<p>"Don't," Sam said interrupting, her tone was laced with tender
authority.  "I'm not blaming you.  I knew, I agreed.  I'm just…
dealing now," she continued, trying to soothe Brooke whose breathing
had increased anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," Brooke admitted softly.  </p>

<p>"I don't think there's anything to do," Sam responded.  There were
certain things where you simply had to admit a loss of control.
These things were put into motion, then they had to be left alone, to
work themselves out.  There was no way they could master this now,
maybe there was never a way that they could, it was too big.</p>

<p>"What do you think is going to happen?"  Brooke asked in a small
voice.  It was a tone that Sam had rarely heard from the blonde, and
the times she had heard it she wished she hadn't.  It hurt her to
hear Brooke in pain, confused and lost.  She wanted to wash it away,
but how?</p>

<p>Sam paused, considering Brooke's question carefully although she was
already fairly certain that she had no idea.   "People are going to
react.  Either one way or another," was what she settled on,
shrugging her shoulders somewhat feebly.</p>

<p> "I think that's a safe prediction," Brooke agreed with a  small
smile.  The smile didn't remain on her face for long however; it was
soon followed by the scrunching together of eyebrows and a
sigh.  "I'm a nervous wreck," she breathed out.</p>

<p> "Is that why you came home?" Sam asked turning her head slightly so
that she could make out some of Brooke's face.</p>

<p> "Is that why you came home?" Brooke asked back, in tone teasing.</p>

<p>"I asked first," Sam responded in a like tone.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke said letting out yet another sigh.  "After I went and
sat back down it was like everything went dark.  I had to concentrate
to make sure I was still breathing.  I was barely functioning, I…I
couldn't take another class or…"</p>

<p>"Walking through the hallways," Sam added.</p>

<p>"The looks.  I got enough of them on the way out," Brooke agreed
shaking her head a bit, as if trying to dislodge the memory.</p>

<p>"We're fucked.  You know this right?" Sam asked turning around in the
circle of Brooke's arms so that they were facing each other.  Brooke
smirked.</p>

<p>"We were fucked the moment I kissed three months ago.  It was just a
matter of time."  She had predicted, even back then, all those months
ago, as they lay together and she traced her hands over Sam's body
exploring her recently discovered landscape, her new alter.  She had
said it would be a complex mess of complications, and it had indeed
turned out that way.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you're overestimating the power of your charms?" Sam
responded quirking an eyebrow at Brooke playfully.  The truth was she
knew that Brooke was right, they had been lost from the very
beginning, the rest of the players in this production were only just
now catching up to them. </p>

<p>"Maybe…maybe not," Brooke responded non-committedely, but the smile
on her face told another story.

They stood there in silence together for a moment, each lost in there
own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is mom pissed?" Sam asked finally, a slightly worried expression
coming over her face as she recalled her behavior when she had first
come in the house.</p>

<p>"She's … worried," Brooke responded thoughtfully, diplomatically.
Jane had not been pleased, that had been very clear to the blonde
when she arrived at the house.</p>

<p>"She's been perpetually worried lately," Sam commented drawing away
from Brooke minutely, moving into herself a little more.  She was
drawn back to the conversation she'd had with her mother that
morning.  It was funny, it hardly seemed like it had been only a
matter of hours ago that they had spoken.  It seemed like so long
ago, a distant memory, already being glazed over in her mind.  Sam
realized that there was a reason her mother had been asking those
questions, telling her those things.  Things hadn't been right, they
had been chaotic and confused, and Jane had picked up on it.  She was
right to be concerned.</p>

<p>"We've been acting like crazy people on and off, today being an on
day," Brooke started carefully.  "She has to have sensed that
something is up," Brooke responded in a reasonable but subdued tone.
The subject of their parents was one they tried not to think about
too much, and when it was brought up it was always grudgingly,
surface conversation.  She knew that she didn't want to really think
about what it mean when they found out, and she knew that Sam felt
the same way.  It was so much easier to believe that they could keep
it to themselves until some unspecified time in the future when it
would be alright to let them know.  So much easier, but wrong.
Still, it was nice thought.</p>

<p>"They're going to find out about this too…sooner or later," Sam said
as if reading Brooke's mind.

"I know."  Brooke pouted as she said this, a small frown marring her
features.</p>

<p>"No matter how careful we are…" Sam continued, trailing off, as she
got lost in her thoughts.   "I can't help the way I look at you.
Carmen says she's amazed they haven't figured it out yet," she
continued.  "She says I have bedroom eyes."</p>

<p>Brooke was quiet for a moment, as she thought about what Sam had just
said, knowing it was perfectly true.  Carmen and Lily had learned the
truth through observing them, and so had Nicole.  It was all just an
issue of time.  They spent more time around their friends, were more
relaxed with them.  But it had been months now, and they both knew
that Jane, if not Mike too, had been watching them, and that like
their friends they would piece it together too.  "They don't want to
figure it out," Brooke responded finally.  </p>

<p>"Lucky for us," Sam replied, but she didn't sound too convinced.</p>

<p>"Lucky, yeah…but for how long?" Brooke added biting her bottom lip,
her eyes roving around the room fretfully.</p>

<p>Sam nodded her head but said nothing.  She didn't want to think about
that at the moment.  She couldn't think about it.  She only had
enough reserves to deal with one catastrophe at a time and their
parents eventual discovery of their relationship was not the one she
was going to preoccupy herself with at the moment.  It was something
that was to happen at some future date, and that meant that in the
present it could be ignored.  What couldn't be ignored were the
ramifications of their lunchtime production.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to school tomorrow," Sam said finally, breaking
the silence that had come over the room.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," Brooke responded with a little laugh before her face
turned serious again.  It was funny in a sad way.</p>

<p>"Let's walk in together?" Sam asked.  She didn't want to go, that was
true, but it was inevitable; they would have to go back sooner or
later.</p>

<p>"I'd have it no other way," Brooke responded taking Sam's hand into
hers.</p>

<p>"I love you," Sam breathed out, stepping closer to Brooke once again,
wrapping her arms around the blonde's slender waist.</p>

<p>"You're my heart," Brooke whispered back, hugging Sam closer.</p>
