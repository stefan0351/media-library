<p>First off, sorry for the delay; I didn't mean to leave you guys hanging after this huge cliffhanger. Second, thanks to all my loyal reviewers - you're what keeps me writing.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter X</b></p>
<p>The first thing Miley noticed when she came to was that she was lying on her back on a lush bedding of grass. She could hear birds twitter in the background and a warm breeze brought the faint rustling of leaves. Miley opened her eyes reluctantly. She was lying in the shade of a large oak tree, its thick, green canopy blocking out the brilliant sun. A slight turn of the head told her she was in a large open pasture â€“ she could even see a few cows grazing along the horizon. With no idea where she was or how she had gotten there, Miley sat up somewhat apprehensively. Someone suddenly stepped into her field of a vision, a man with a face weathered by the outdoors, wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. His hair was slightly longer than customary, though a cowboy hat covered most of it. He was wearing jeans and boots and a hideous button down shirt, but Miley was too taken by his face to pay close attention. The man grinned as he saw her and Miley matched it with one of her own.</p>
<p>"Daddy!"</p>
<p>Before she even had a chance to jump up, her father was already leaning down and scooped her up into his large arms. Miley wrapped her arms around his neck, letting herself be lifted off her feet as she enjoyed his bone-crushing hug. It was not until several minutes later that Robbie Ray Stewart set his daughter back onto her feet. Miley rested her head on his broad chest and squeezed once more, before pulling back to look at him.</p>
<p>He looked just as she remembered him, the same wrinkles, not a hair out of place. Miley looked around.</p>
<p>"Where's Jackson?"</p>
<p>As if on cue, her father stepped away to reveal her brother standing just behind him by the tailgate of an old truck she had not noticed before. He engulfed her in a hug as well, warm and comforting just as she remembered. Her brother Jackson had been her one true friend throughout the years she was ostracized and hated by everyone else; her loneliest time in life had been after his death and before she met Lilly.</p>
<p>Miley looked between her father and brother and across the green, sunny pasture and a horrible thought dawned on her. "Oh no, I'm dead, aren't I? Momma's gonna kill me." Despite their recent struggles, Miley hated the thought that she had caused her mother more grief.</p>
<p>The two men merely chuckled, however, and Robby Ray laid a calming hand on Miley's shoulder. "Don't worry, bud, you're not dead. Though I reckon your momma's not gonna be pleased when you wake up."</p>
<p>Miley frowned, the confusion clearly etched across her face. "Then why am I here? Why are you here? Where is here?"</p>
<p>Laughing again, Robby Ray guided Miley to sit on the tailgate, while both men stood just in front of it. Miley watched them curiously, but completely at ease. She trusted them implicitly and knew, regardless of where she was, she was safe. Jackson and his father looked at each other, before turning back to Miley, their faces now serious.</p>
<p>"Now, bud, you gotta listen to me, it's very important," said Robby Ray, trying to convey to his whimsical daughter the seriousness of the situation. Miley nodded intently and he continued. "You're in danger; Jackson and I, well, we had to break some rules just to try and come talk to you."</p>
<p>"So, you sent the lightning?" asked Miley, naturally ignoring the part about danger to herself.</p>
<p>"No, Miles, that one's all you," said Jackson from the side, smirking at his little sister. He earned a stern glare from his father.</p>
<p>"We didn't send it, Milesâ€¦it'sâ€¦difficult to explain and we're not exactly allowed to. But we had to come and warn you about the man who is trying to kill you."</p>
<p>Miley's eyes widened, pieces clicking together in her head. "Richard?"</p>
<p>Robby Ray shook his head, frustration showing. "I don't know his name. Who is Richard?"</p>
<p>"Momma's new boyfriend. He's creepy and I don't like him."</p>
<p>If Robby Ray was affected by hearing about his wife's dating life, he did not show it. "You're not giving your momma a hard time, are you?"</p>
<p>Judging by Miley's sheepish look, he had his answer. Robby Ray shook his head. "Listen, bud, you need your momma, especially now. If this Richard person is the man comin' after you, you need to be careful. But I also don't want you focusin' on this guy just 'cause you don't like him bein' with your momma."</p>
<p>Miley met his eyes, voicing her true feelings about Richard for the first time. "I don't like momma being with someone who's not you, Daddy."</p>
<p>Robby Ray smiled and brushed a hand across the top of Miley's head. "I know, bud, but your momma is a good woman and she deserves love just as much as you do. I don't want you givin' her a hard time anymore, Miles, okay? You've got more important things to focus on."</p>
<p>Miley nodded, though she knew there was no way she could trust Richard, especially not with her father's warning in mind. "Why is this man trying to kill me?"</p>
<p>"I can't say, Miley. Something big is happening and you're in the middle of it. He needs you dead and I cannot let it happen. Whatever happens, Miley, you need to fight."</p>
<p>Miley swallowed, the seriousness of his words finally sinking in. She nodded quickly and Robby Ray pulled her against his body, hugging her close. His heart thudded loudly as she leaned her head against his chest and a horrible feeling washed over her. Miley pulled back, ashamed and horrified as she remembered why her brother and father were here. She looked away, unable to meet their eyes as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Daddy, I'm sorryâ€¦I'm sorry for killing youâ€¦and Jackson."</p>
<p>A heavy lump formed in her throat as she prepared for the rejection and admonishment sure to come. She felt her father's hands grab her shoulders and looked up. Robby Ray's face was serious, though surprised.</p>
<p>"You did not kill us, Miley. Why would you think that?"</p>
<p>She watched him skeptically. "The lightningâ€¦it came for me, but it killed you instead."</p>
<p>"The lightning did not come for <b>us</b>, Miley. It didn't kill us," said Jackson from the side, his own voice serious for once.</p>
<p>She looked at him, confused. "Then what did? They said the lightning caused the car to crashâ€¦"</p>
<p>Jackson looked as if he wanted to answer, but Robby Ray shook his head to tell him not to. Jackson did not look happy about it, but acquiesced. "We can't tell you, Miley. Just know it wasn't your fault, okay? You did nothing wrong, sis."</p>
<p>Miley wanted to ask more questions, not at all satisfied with the answer they had given, but Robby Ray started looking around, nervously. The sunlight seemed to be fading and he turned to Miley with a sad smile. "It's time for you to go, bud."</p>
<p>"Do I have to?" Miley had missed her father and brother and just being in their company was giving her new hope.</p>
<p>Robby Ray smiled and nodded. "Your momma is getting pretty worried, bud. You've got to go back, for her and your grandma, and Lilly, of course."</p>
<p>Miley looked at him in surprise, but took the hand he offered to hop down off the tailgate. "You know about Lilly?"</p>
<p>"We know about <b>everything</b>, li'l sis," said Jackson, smirking as he and his father walked Miley back to the tree she had woken up under. "Congratulations on finallyâ€¦you knowâ€¦"</p>
<p>Miley blushed for the first time ever in regards to her sex life and suddenly felt bad for all the times she had teased Lilly. Jackson earned a smack on the back of the head from Robby Ray for his comment, but Miley nevertheless couldn't meet her father's eyes. They stopped in front of the tree, all too painfully aware of the upcoming goodbye. Jackson gave his sister a quick hug and Robby Ray squeezed Miley again until her ribs hurt, pressing a tender kiss to the top of her head.</p>
<p>"Take care of yourself, bud, and your momma. And remember, we'll always be looking out for you, okay?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded, the lump from earlier back in full force. "I love you guys."</p>
<p>"And we love you, bud. Now go on, it's time," said Robby Ray. The two men stood and watched over her while she lay back down in the grass. Reluctantly Miley closed her eyes and she was gone the moment she did.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>When she came to again it was a lot less pleasant. Her consciousness returned several seconds before the control of her body did and the first thing Miley noticed were the sirens. They were almost numbingly loud. The surface she was lying on was uncomfortable and somewhat unsteady. With the return of feeling in her arms and legs came an overpowering feeling of pins and needles throughout her entire body. There were hands on her body, the touch intensifying the feeling until her stomach rolled. Miley opened her eyes, hardly focusing on the surrounding shelves stocked with medical supplies and the tubing hanging above her, and immediately leaned to her right to throw up.</p>
<p>She blinked warily, noticing for the first time the pair of legs right in front of her and the shoes she'd just thrown up on. Miley gripped the bars of the stretcher tightly, lying back again. A cool hand brushed across her forehead. Miley groaned. "I'm sorry, momma."</p>
<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for, honey. Just relax, okay?" The worry was clearly evident in Susan's voice, though just seeing Miley awake had lifted a huge weight off her chest.</p>
<p>"I threw up on your shoes. Now you're gonna smell," said Miley, hardly concerned about her own current predicament.</p>
<p>Susan laughed, though not from humor â€“ she'd just nearly lost her daughter, again and the adrenaline and terror still had her tightly in their grips. Quickly swiping the tears from her eyes, she reached over to take Miley's hand in hers. "Don't worry about me, sweet pea. Just relax, we'll be at the hospital soon."</p>
<p>Her mother's words took a few moments to register with Miley. The tingling was slowly fading from her body and with it came a renewed sense of clarity. A woman wearing a dark blue uniform stepped into her line of view, checking some of the tubing hanging from the ceiling. Miley glanced around and her eyes widened, as if realizing for the first time where she was. She tried to sit, but the paramedic and her mother stopped her.</p>
<p>"I'm fine; I don't need to go to the hospital."</p>
<p>"Sweetie, just relax. Do you know what happened?" The paramedic had to yell over the din of the sirens, but her demeanor was calm and collected.</p>
<p>Miley ignored the woman, instead reaching for the IV taped to her arm. Her mother's hand stopped her just in time and Susan took both of Miley's hands into hers to keep her from touching things. "Mileyâ€¦"</p>
<p>She must have sounded worried about Miley's lack of an answer or her odd attitude and the paramedic rested a hand on Susan's arm, as if to calm her. "It's not uncommon for her to be confused after something like this."</p>
<p>Miley's head finally turned to look at the woman, her eyes showing her surprise. "I'm not confused. I just don't wanna go to a hospital again."</p>
<p>"Hun, you were struck by lightning; you could have serious internal injuries. And a doctor needs to look at your burn," said the paramedic, still sounding calm even though her patient was getting increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>"I got burned?" asked Miley, flexing her muscles to determine if something hurt. Other than a mild, residual tingling she felt pretty good. Looking down along her body, she noticed the gauze on her right foot and calf. She frowned. "I lost a shoe."</p>
<p>"The lightning knocked it off, hun," said Susan, refusing to let go of her daughter's hands even while the girl tried to pull them away. She knew as soon as Miley had free hands IV, EKG electrodes and bandages would be in danger.</p>
<p>Miley frowned again. She moved her left foot, still in its shoe, and then the right somewhat tentatively. It didn't particularly hurt and she sighed. "I liked these shoes."</p>
<p>Susan shook her head and though the worry wasn't yet gone, she was just happy Miley seemed to be her normal self. The paramedic on the other hand seemed to still think Miley was in a state of serious confusion. Susan didn't want to give her more reason to think so and tried once again to get Miley to be still.</p>
<p>"We'll get you new ones, honey. Now please just lie there and be calm; you're going to the hospital and that's that."</p>
<p>Miley wanted to do anything but lie still, especially with the tingles she still felt, but she did as her mother said for once. She had promised her father, after all. Miley thought of her brief visit with her dad and brother. She wanted to tell her mother about it, wanted her to share in the happiness of knowing the two men were fine and watching over them, but Miley didn't know how the woman would take it. She would either think Miley was really confused and hallucinating or that she had died for a short moment after the strike. Neither sounded like a good option to Miley.</p>
<p>"Momma?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sweet pea?"</p>
<p>"Can you call Lilly?" Miley really wanted her girlfriend, though she knew Lilly was still stuck in North Carolina with her parents somewhere. Miley was confident Lilly would believe her and share in her joy over seeing her dad and brother again.</p>
<p>Susan smiled and nodded, realizing this was the most compliant Miley had been in a long time. "I'll call her as soon as we're at the hospital."</p>
<p>Miley nodded, resigning herself to the unpleasant hospital visit that lay ahead. The ambulance ride did not last much longer and Miley spent it curiously gazing at the gadgets and equipment around her. Her hands itched to touch and moved things, but her mother's iron grip would not let up. And truth be told, Miley was happy about it â€“ she finally had her mother's full attention again.</p>
<p>Several hours later found Miley sitting in a hospital bed at the Middle Tennessee Medical Center ER, digging a spoon into her third pudding cup. She was bored out of her mind and the nurses had quickly figured out to keep her plied with pudding and Jell-o to stop her from climbing out of her bed and fiddling with their equipment. Miley set the empty cup and spoon on the little table and sighed heavily. A nurse stood next to the bed, checking the monitors again and making notations in a chart.</p>
<p>"Can I go, yet?"</p>
<p>The nurse chuckled. She'd heard the same question probably two dozen times by now, but despite her inability to sit still and be quiet Miley was a patient they all enjoyed. The girl's natural charm and quirkiness certainly beat angry drunks and overbearing parents. She patted Miley's shoulder conciliatorily.</p>
<p>"Sorry hun, but your doctor wants to make sure your heart and head are okay after getting zapped."</p>
<p>Miley smirked slightly at the euphemism for the lightning strike. "I'm not a bug. And I feel fine."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you do, sweetie, but since I remember you saying the same thing after you jumped off a tree, I'm gonna defer to Dr. Khauf on this one, okay?"</p>
<p>Unable to argue that point, Miley just sighed and leaned back in her bed. She wanted to talk to Lilly, but wouldn't be able to until she left this place. Her mother had called Lilly earlier, but that was a few hours ago now and Miley was getting antsy. Richard had finally convinced Susan to grab a quick bite to eat in the cafeteria and Miley was happy to be rid of him. He hadn't done anything suspicious since before the strike, but she was certainly keeping her eye on him.</p>
<p>Miley looked up as someone entered the room. The hospital had called Dr. Khauf since he had more experience with her special case and he hadn't hesitated to come right away to examine her and run some tests, much to Miley's chagrin. Dr. Khauf was followed by both her mother and Richard, all wearing somber expressions. Susan immediately went back to her daughter's side and took her hand, making Miley feel almost okay about the bad news sure to come.</p>
<p>Dr. Khauf set a chart on the foot end of the bed and heaved a sigh. "So, Miley, here we are again."</p>
<p>"Can I go home now, doc?"</p>
<p>He smiled warmly at her and patted her shoulder just as the nurse had done earlier. "Soon, Miley. First I want to talk to you about the tests we ran."</p>
<p>"She's gonna be okay, isn't she?" asked Susan from across the bed, clutching Miley's hand more tightly.</p>
<p>"Well, her brain looks fine and her heart is beating normally. However, I'm extremely concerned about the arrhythmias recorded earlier after the strike."</p>
<p>"But I'm fine now, so let's go," said Miley, not wanting to her mother to hear more reasons to keep her from climbing trees.</p>
<p>"Yes, you're fine now, but at this point I'm worried about your heart's ability to withstand another strike like this," said Dr. Khauf, ignoring Miley's pleas to leave.</p>
<p>Susan looked worriedly between her daughter and the doctor. "What does that mean, doctor?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to say this, but if Miley gets struck again, she will not survive it," said the doctor, voice somber.</p>
<p>Susan gasped, but Miley only felt annoyance at his statement. She <b>felt</b> fine and didn't really believe in what the doctor was saying â€“ he'd said she may die before the last strike and here she was. A cursory glance at her mother showed the woman was crying and Miley swallowed hard, knowing this could mean only trouble. She risked a glance at Richard, who stood in the corner watching them, but his face betrayed no emotion at all.</p>
<p>"I'd say the best course of action at this point is to keep Miley from getting into the situations where she may normally be exposed to lightning. We'll continue to run tests and start treatment to strengthen her heart," said Dr. Khauf, his eyes focused on a distressed Susan.</p>
<p>"Yes, Doctor, thank you so much."</p>
<p>Miley didn't understand why her mother was thanking him for giving them such horrid news, but she kept quiet. Miley had a horrible feeling this news would spell a permanent end to climbing trees. She just wanted to leave the hospital and then hopefully her mother would calm down enough to see reason once they got home.</p>
<p>Dr. Khauf nodded and pulled a syringe filled with a light pinkish liquid from his coat pocket and moved towards Miley's IV. "I'll just give you this and then we'll get you discharged, Miley, how's that sound?"</p>
<p>"What are you giving her?"</p>
<p>Miley turned her head, surprised to hear Richard speak and slightly annoyed he had asked the question on her own mind. His face was still unreadable, but his eyes were intense and dark as he stared down the doctor. Dr. Khauf, however, merely smiled, uncapping the syringe.</p>
<p>"It's part of the treatment I just mentioned." Dr. Khauf reached for the IV and suddenly Richard was right next to Miley's bed.</p>
<p>"What is it for?"</p>
<p>Miley looked between her nemesis, Richard, and the doctor who had promised to finally discharge her, confused. Richard had hardly spoken a word since reaching the hospital and she could not understand how this fit into the scheme of things.</p>
<p>Dr. Khauf was still smiling as he looked at Richard. "To strengthen her heart, like I said."</p>
<p>Richard's expression never changed and his voice remained even, but the look in his eyes made Miley uncomfortable. "What's it called?"</p>
<p>Dr. Khauf's smile finally slipped and Miley couldn't tell whether he was annoyed or nervous. Before he could answer, however, Susan rested a hand on Richard's arm, drawing his attention away. "Richard, it's fine. Dr. Khauf knows what he's doing."</p>
<p>The doctor nodded and when Richard acquiesced, emptied the contents of the syringe into Miley's IV. She almost expected something to happen, but felt nothing. Dr. Khauf, smile back on his face, patted her shoulder and promised to get a nurse to discharge her now. He said 'goodbye' to Susan and Miley, but ignored Richard, whose eyes were still trained on the doctor. He exited the room, leaving Miley with her mother and the man she was sure was out to kill her.</p>
