<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Digging Out -->

<p>"Welcome to the St. Franciscan Life Center, Samantha. I'm Sister Margaret. Why don't you have a seat so that we can talk?" the nun dressed in a drab brown habit suggested. Sam sighed and nodded as she took a seat.</p>
<p>She looked around the small room. Its walls were bare wood save for a few small pictures hanging in strategic places. There were large panel windows to her left letting the early afternoon sun stream in through the blinds and the room itself had a somewhat woodsy smell to it. It was comfortable and non-threatening, lacking in the usual antiseptic impersonal feel that Sam was used to. But any way you looked at it, Sam didn't want to be there.</p>
<p>She had reluctantly agreed to give the Center a try because Brooke had begged her to. Not asked, requested, or pleaded but out right begged her to go. Through her tears the blonde had explained how she was afraid of losing Sam, exposed her vulnerability and fears for Sam to see. She told the emotionally wounded brunette how she felt that Sam was drifting away from her and that she just wanted to hold on to her as tight as she could. Faced with such open honesty, Sam couldn't find it in her heart to say no to Brooke. If it would make the distraught blonde feel better, Sam would try just about anything.</p>
<p>"So, Sam?may I call you `Sam'? Or do you prefer Samantha?" Sister Margaret asked.</p>
<p>"Sam's fine. Samantha is too formal," Sam said quietly.</p>
<p>"All right then. Sam, can I get you anything? Coffee, tea, hot chocolate?" Sister Margaret offered. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," she said. Sister Margaret nodded.</p>
<p>"All right. Why don't we start with a little back history then? Have you ever been to a therapist before?" Sam snorted.</p>
<p>"I'd use the term `therapist' in a very loose sense, but yes, I have," she commented dryly.</p>
<p>"I take it that it didn't go well?"</p>
<p>"A horrible disaster would be an understatement," Sam retorted.</p>
<p>"Would you like to tell me about it?" Sister Margaret asked carefully.</p>
<p>"Not really, but I suppose I don't have much of a choice," Sam said, plainly irritated. Sister Margaret shook her head.</p>
<p>"Sam, I'm not the Gestapo. I'm not here to force information or a confession from you. I'm here to help you, if you want me to. I'm not going to force you to say or do or behave in anyway that is remotely uncomfortable for you." Sam eyed the nun suspiciously.</p>
<p>"So, I only have to say what I want to?" she asked. Sister Margaret nodded again.</p>
<p>"Right. Although if there is an issue that I think needs to be addressed I will try to shepherd us in that direction. But if you're not ready then we'll move on to something else." Sister Margaret watched as Sam visibly relaxed somewhat.</p>
<p>"So, you're not going to try and change me, `fix' me, or make me `normal'?"</p>
<p>"Sam, normal is a relative term open to personal interpretation. What's normal for one person may not be for another. So no, I'm not going to do any of those things. I'm here to help you deal with your anger and depression and hopefully find a way to be happy," Sister Margaret explained.</p>
<p>"OK," Sam said warily, still a bit suspicious. "I saw a shrink a while back when my Mom and Mike asked Brooke and I to go."</p>
<p>"Mike was going to be your stepfather, correct?" Sam nodded. "And Brooke is his daughter and?"</p>
<p>"My lover," Sam said without hesitation. She arched an eyebrow at the nun and gave her a lopsided smirk. "Does that bother you? That I'm gay?" Sister Margaret returned the arched eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to shock me, Sam? Because you're going to have to do better than that to succeed. Trust me, there isn't anything that you can say that I haven't already heard."</p>
<p>"Besides," she continued. "My religious views or opinions hold no baring on your life. They are MY beliefs, not yours. And I will not push then upon you. That's not why you're here."</p>
<p>"OK, cool," Sam nodded. That made her feel a lot better.</p>
<p>"So your parents sent the two of you to therapy because of your relationship?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. And the guy wasn't interested in helping us. Neither were Mom or Mike. All they wanted was to change us, `fix' us. You know, stop our relationship because they felt it was wrong," Sam began.</p>
<p>"And that was hard for you," Sister Margaret supplied.</p>
<p>"Yes! I love Brooke with everything I am and yet here are my parental figures, the two people I'm supposed to look up to and learn from telling me that I'm wrong, evil, freakish. That hurt!"</p>
<p>"And it wasn't just that," Sam explained emotionally. "They didn't even take the time to TRY and understand what I feel for her. Not that they could. They couldn't even begin to comprehend the depth of what I feel for Brooke. I've loved her for so long but never thought?" she trailed off for a second and stared out the window.</p>
<p>"Never thought what, Sam?" Sister Margaret prompted softly when Sam was quiet for several minutes. Sam stared at her shoes as she answered.</p>
<p>"I never thought she'd ever love me back," she whispered as a lone tear raced down her cheek.</p>
<p>"Why's that, Sam?"</p>
<p>"Because?because she's Brooke," Sam sniffled with a shrug. "I never thought she'd see me that way and then it happened and then I lost it."</p>
<p>"You didn't lose it, Sam. From what I heard from Brooke when I spoke to her, it was taken from you," Sister Margaret soothed. "And she still loves you. Why don't you start from the beginning so that I can understand how we got to where you are right now?" Sam grabbed a tissue from the box beside her and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Well, it all really started one day after school when my friend Lily came to talk to me?"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You missed a spot," Lily teased as Nicole helped her wash her car. Nicole looked up from her bucket of suds and frowned.</p>
<p>"Huh?" she asked, stopping and looking at Lily. Lily walked over and pointed to a spot to Nicole's left.</p>
<p>"Right there, you missed that spot," she pointed out. Nicole lowered her sunglasses and looked at the spot.</p>
<p>"I did not," she argued. "I scrubbed it good and AAAAARRRRRRGH!!! LILY!" she screamed as Lily hosed her in the back with the cold water. Lily giggled and took off running, hose in hand. Nicole glared at the giggling Latina.</p>
<p>"I'm going to get you for that," she warned lowly. Lily felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up at the tone of Nicole's voice. She wasn't sure being caught would be such a bad thing but she put up a good chase. Eventually though, Nicole tackled her into the grass.</p>
<p>"Think you're funny, do ya?" Nicole taunted as she started to tickle the girl below her. Lily howled in laughter.</p>
<p>"Niki, stop," she begged between fits. "I can't breathe -giggle-(hic)"</p>
<p>"Say you're sorry," Nicole ordered as she laughed as well. "Then I'll let you go."</p>
<p>"(hic) `M s'ry, (hic)" Lily mumbled as the hiccups gained control. Nicole cocked her head to the side.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry? What was that? I couldn't quite understand you there."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry! I'm (hic) sorry!" Lily yelled still laughing.</p>
<p>"See? That's better," Nicole said, still sitting on Lily. "You all right?" she asked slightly concerned. Lily's face was red and tears streamed down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, Niki," she said happily.</p>
<p>"Good. I'm glad I didn't hurt you," Nicole said. She caressed the side of Lily's face. "Do you have any idea how much I missed you?" she asked, her voice lowering in tone as she spoke and sending tremors down Lily's spine. A slow smile spread across Lily's face and she started rubbing Nicole's thighs with her palms.</p>
<p>"As much as I missed you?" she responded.</p>
<p>"More," Nicole said as their lips brushed against one another. They stayed that way on the lawn, pressed together content for several minutes until a voice interrupted them.</p>
<p>"Lily! Muchacha! Qué usted está haciendo?" Lily's Uncle Alberto yelled from the doorway of the house. "El poner en una demostración para los vecinos?" he laughed. Nicole looked at Lily in question.</p>
<p>"He wants to know if we're putting on a show for the neighbors," Lily explained with a deep blush as she realized that her hands had wandered into Nicole's shorts and Nicole's had found their way up her tank top. Nicole looked at the position they were in and started laughing.</p>
<p>"Tell him, `yes, as a matter of fact we are'," she smiled devilishly. Lily looked back at her uncle.</p>
<p>"Sí, somos," she called. Alberto burst out laughing again and wandered back into the house shaking his head. Lily turned back to Nicole.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should take this inside," she whispered lowly. Nicole nodded.</p>
<p>"We really should get out of these wet clothes before we catch cold," she said logically. Lily nodded.</p>
<p>"Race you."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam sat on her bed with the notebook Sister Margaret had given her to keep as a journal.</p>
<p>(Like I really needed another journal, but whatever) she laughed to herself. She flipped to the second page and started writing.</p>
<br>
<p>Journal of Sam McPherson</p>
<p>I'm scared. Not that `frightened of the dark' scared either. I'm talking the `choke off your air, curl up under the covers and pretend the world doesn't exist' scared. The kind that makes you randomly shake and fidget because you're so anxious that something bad is going to happen or you're going to somehow fuck things up. That's me. Unintentionally intentionally sabotaging myself whenever things go my way. It's like I can't let myself be happy.</p>
<p>Not that this is technically my fault. No, I think I've finally gotten the fact that it's Mike's. I never meant for all this shit to happen. I never thought it would. I mean, I was serious when I told Sister Margaret that I never thought Brooke could love me. Call it low self-esteem, call it whatever you want but I could never see her falling for someone like me. Not that there's anything really wrong with me but?damn even in writing I can't say what I mean anymore.</p>
<p>I've always seen myself as damaged goods. Especially after my dad died. The girl with the missing piece, the hole in her heart. How could anyone love someone who was incapable of feeling the emotion herself? And then I realized somewhere around my sophomore year that I was gay. I had developed a deep crush on Brooke. I've never cared for anyone else. And then what I thought was a crush turned out to be love. I was scared then, that's why I fought so much with her. And when our parents got together, I thought that there was no way I could live that close to her and not say anything. But somehow, I swallowed my feelings and she never knew. At least until Lily spilled her guts.</p>
<p>Even then though, when Brooke came to me and said she had feelings?I didn't dare believe her. Can you imagine the pain and agony if she'd been lying or changed her mind? Again, I was SO scared. The thought of having that beautiful wonderful woman, only to lose her somehow. But she promised that it was real and that that wouldn't happen. But Mike MADE it happen. And my world fell apart.</p>
<p>Now, I'm scared of trying again. What if I lose her again? What if I can't get her back? I've had a taste of my heaven and now I'm in hell.</p>
<br>
<p>Sam was interrupted from her writing by her window sliding open. She looked up in surprise as Brooke slinked in the open passageway.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she asked with a giggle as Brooke brushed her hands off on her jeans. Brooke grinned.</p>
<p>"I had to see you. I'm `out to dinner' with Terri again. I could have used the front door but I thought this was more romantic," Brooke explained as she stood in the middle of Sam's room, her eyes slightly hooded as she stared at the brunette. "I even thought of doing the whole `Romeo and Juliet' routine. But then I remembered how that ended for them and figured, why tempt fate?"</p>
<p>"I'm glad to see you," Sam said as she put her notebook away.</p>
<p>"Me too," Brooke responded. "Whatcha got there?" she asked, pointing to the book. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Just a journal for therapy."</p>
<p>"How'd that go?" Brooke walked a little closer and stood in front of Sam's sitting form, lacing her fingers in Sam's hands.</p>
<p>"Surprisingly well," Sam said, kissing the tips of Brooke's fingers. "You have beautiful hands," she said absently.</p>
<p>"You are beautiful," Brooke whispered while running one hand through Sam's long brown hair. "God, I miss you every night, Sammy." Sam leaned into the touch.</p>
<p>"I miss you too," she sighed. Brooke kneeled down in front of her lover moving her hands to the edges of Sam's shirt and teasing the skin underneath. Sam's eyes fluttered and she gasped at the wanted and missed touch.</p>
<p>"I'm here now, Sammy," Brooke said huskily. "Let's not waste the time."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam woke up to find Brooke still asleep, her head resting on the brunette's chest. Fear and panic flashed through Sam as she realized that the sun was streaming in through her window and the nearby clock read 7:17 AM.</p>
<p>"Shit! Brooke! Brooke, wake up!" she hissed at the sleeping blonde. Brooke sighed and grumbled before slowly opening her eyes. She looked directly up into Sam's panic-stricken countenance.</p>
<p>"What Sam? What's wrong?" she asked, instantly alarmed by the paleness of Sam's features and her wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Brooke, it's after 7 in the morning," Sam said as tears sprang to her eyes. It took a minute for Brooke to catch on. She scooted up Sam's body so that they were face to face.</p>
<p>"Sammy, calm down. It's OK," she tried to calm her quickly panicking girlfriend. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"He's going to kill us both! Brooke, your Dad is going to go ballistic!" Brooke stroked Sam's cheek and wiped away her tears.</p>
<p>"No he's not, Sam. Oh I should have told you last night when I got here. Calm down, Sammy. He's not going to know I was here," Brooke assured her. "He had to go out of town for the weekend and left me with Terri since there was no other choice. Trust me, he wasn't happy about it. But he thinks Terri is still staying at the motel and that that is where I'm staying. Since Terri still has the room under her name although she's staying here, if he calls, they'll take a message for us. Don't worry, Sam. Terri has it under control."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" Sam asked in a tiny fear filled voice. The voice broke Brooke's heart as she nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, love. I'm sure. I wouldn't have stayed all night if Terri hadn't told me that she'd handle everything. So relax and enjoy the company." Sam sighed and tried to get her heartbeat back under control.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I panicked," she whispered as she closed her eyes again. Brooke curled up a little closer to her, her head on Sam's shoulder and rubbing slow circles on Sam's bare abdomen. She missed being able to reach out and touch Sam whenever she wanted to. There were some nights when she couldn't sleep because she craved Sam's presence so badly.</p>
<p>"It's totally understandable. I should have let you know what was going on when I got here last night. I was just so damn happy to see you?" Brooke explained. "I wish you weren't so afraid of him," she added softly. Sam leaned down and kissed the top of her head.</p>
<p>"I wish I didn't have reason to be," she responded. "But I'm so afraid that he's going to hurt you. I wouldn't be able to stand that." Sam shivered, making Brooke wrap her arms around her tightly.</p>
<p>"And I can't stand that he already hurt you," Brooke sighed burrowing her nose in the crook of Sam's neck. She loved the way Sam smelled. It was home to her.</p>
<p>"Move in with me," Sam blurted out suddenly. Brooke picked up her head again and looked down at Sam. Sam's eyes opened and focused on her.</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke arched an eyebrow both elated and confused by the question.</p>
<p>"Here, in this house. Move in with me," Sam repeated. Brooke smiled.</p>
<p>"I'd love to, Sammy, but you know that I can't. And you know why." Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Someday?" Sam asked. Brooke kissed her deeply and then buried her face in Sam's neck again, kissing the pulse point she found there as well.</p>
<p>"Definitely. We'll find a way someday, Sammy. I promise."</p>
