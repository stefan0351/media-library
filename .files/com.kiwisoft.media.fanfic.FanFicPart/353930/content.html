<!-- About a Girl \ Part 4 -->

<p><u><i>Manning House</i></u></p>

<p>Grace walked into the living room hurriedly looking behind to make  sure that she had successfully ditched Zoë.  She loved her little  sister, she really did, but she was tired of hearing out the damn  holes in the ozone.  Satisfied that she was safe in a Zoë free zone,  she looked around the room spotting Jessie lying on the couch  starring at the TV.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you speak fluid French too," Grace began crossing the  room to sit on the free couch.  "Because I would literally have to  throw myself off a bridge."</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked blinking at Grace in confusion.  She hadn't even  seen her come into the room, just heard a kind of far off rumbling  and turned to see Grace sitting there with her mouth flapping.  "What  are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Grace studied for a moment only then realizing how out of it Jessie  had to have been.  She nodded towards the TV.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Jessie responded, her mind finally putting together what it  was Grace had said.  "I … no," she continued picking up the remote  and flipping the channel.  "I can't."</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" Grace asked staring at Jessie.  She was the one  that was forever complaining about how everyone fawned over Jessie  like she was a newborn puppy or something, and had sworn that she  would never join the `protection of precious widdle Jessie' fan club,  but seeing the girl sitting there obviously out of it, she just  couldn't help herself.</p>

<p> "Oh.  Yeah.  Fine," Jessie responded, her reply coming a second to  late to be even remotely believable.</p>

<p> "You want to talk about it?" Grace asked a moment later  contemplating whether she really cared enough to try dragging  information out of Jessie, then realizing she had nothing better to  do.</p>

<p>Jessie hesitated for a moment, debating internally whether or not she  should talk about what was bothering her with Grace.  "I don't really  know that there's anything to talk about," she said finally.  The  truth was that she kind of wanted some advice and Grace was the only  person who knew what was really happening between her and Katie to  any degree, so she didn't really have a choice in the matter.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Grace asked.</p>

<p>"It's just," Jessie began shaking her head.  "I don't know.  Katie  was acting kind of strange last night.  Upset I guess.  But I don't …  I can' t figure out why," she finished with a sigh looking over at  her stepsister.</p>

<p>"That's easy," Grace replied immediately.  "It's because women are  insane.  That'll be five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Jessie looked over at Grace once she finished talking, holding her  gaze for a moment before muttering, "thanks so much for your help."</p>

<p>Grace grinned at her, and she smiled back, silence covering the room  once more before Grace finally broke it.</p>

<p>"What were you talking about before she got all weird?"</p>

<p>"It's private," Jessie muttered in response, her head dropping down  to stare at her lap as she felt her cheeks start to colour, a  sensation that only increased when she heard Grace snicker in the  background.</p>

<p>"I don't need a blow by blow account," Grace said finally even though  she kind of would liked one after seeing Jessie's expression.  "Just  sum it up or something."</p>

<p>Jessie took a deep breath, readying herself as if she were about to  face a firing squad, and then began to speak.  "We were just talking,  and then she … she just told me that I was like important to her and  stuff," she continued her voice dropping as she remembered the  conversation they had had.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you respond?" Grace asked impatiently wondering if  conversation was truly a lost art.  Nobody she knew seemed to be able  to carry on a halfway decent narrative.  It was extremely vexing.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jessie responded shooting Grace a rather biting  look.  "I mean I guess I didn't."</p>

<p>Grace's face fell and her eyes narrowed upon hearing this, her head  turning to look at Jessie with an expression that clearly showed that  she thought Jessie was dumber than a chimp.</p>

<p> "What?"  Jessie asked a bit self-consciously.</p>

<p>"Well, that's obviously it," Grace replied as if what she was saying  were common knowledge.  "Have you ever told her?  How you feel?"  Grace asked looking around to make sure no one was around before she  continued.  "She's probably all insecure about whatever is going on  between you two.  I mean how could she not be after the way you  acted?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean `after the way I acted'?" Jessie asked  grumpily.  "I didn't do anything."</p>

<p>"Nothing except stop talking to her, fake sick to avoid her, and then  turn it all around on her like 180 degrees in a five minute period of  time," Grace replied giving Jessie a hostile little look as she  remembered Katie coming up to her in class, all big watery eyes and  shaky concern over how Jessie had responded to her  letter.  "Basically you fed her a horse sized anxiety pill and now  she's foaming."</p>

<p>Jessie was silent for a moment after that, looking almost  contemplative, and then she looked back over at Grace with a look of  utter confusion on her face.  She obviously had no clue what Grace  was talking about.</p>

<p>Grace sighed deeply.  "She doesn't know how you feel about her and  what's happening between you two.  For all she knows you're using her  to practice until Tad asks you out again," she explained slowly.</p>

<p> "I'm not…" Jessie protested emphatically, shooting Grace an offended  look.</p>

<p>"That's not the point," Grace explained.  "I'm talking about what she  knows, and she doesn't know that that's not what you're doing because  you've never talked to her about it," she went on.  "Of course, I  could be wrong.  Maybe she just had a headache, or indigestion or  something.  But either way you should probably talk to her.  It never  hurt anyone to hear that the person they like likes them back."</p>

<p>"But…" Jessie started, but she was interrupted before she could  finish.</p>

<p>"But what?" Grace asked her.  "You make-out with her so she should be  able to tell?" she continued, smiling as Jessie shot her a look of  pure venom.  "Trust me Jess, it doesn't work that way."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed as she thought over what it was Grace had told  her.  "What if I don't know what to tell her?"</p>

<p>"You obviously know something," Grace responded certain that Jessie  had to have some idea what she was feeling if she had been semi- dating Katie for almost a month now.   "So tell her what you do  know."</p>

<p> "I don't know," Jessie responded uncertainly, leaning back against  the couch wearily.</p>

<p>"Then maybe she's right to be concerned," Grace responded frankly  leaning back as well.</p>

<p>Jessie turned to look at Grace upon hearing that, a denial already  upon her tongue when she heard the front door open and heard Lily and  Judy's voice's as they trudged into the house.   Hearing the noise  get closer and realizing they were coming into the room Jessie turned  away from Grace and started flipping through the channels once again.</p>

<p>"Hey girls," Lily said walking into the room smiling at them.  "How  were your days?"</p>

<p>"Ok," they replied simultaneously before slumping even further down  into the cushions.</p>

<p>Lily glanced over at Judy upon seeing this watching as her sister  smirked at her, shrugging her shoulders as if to say `teenagers,  can't live with them are legally contracted to take care of them'.   Lily frowned, it was hard being mother, it really was.</p>
