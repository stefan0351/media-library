<p><b>Chapter 7</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled as she entered the diner, her eyes immediately on the booth in the far corner. Miley had been sick almost the entire week, and it was good to finally see her out. Lilly had missed her trademark grin and exuberance and her heartbeat quickened just knowing she'd finally get to talk to her again. She'd left Miley's house late last Friday, after a super awkward dinner where Grandma Ruby kept trying to get her to eat more, Susan kept staring and Miley spilled chicken soup all over her. It had been an interesting evening, to say the least, but one she was not keen to repeat. Miley's grandma was nice, but she, too, kept secrets Lilly could see in her eyes and Miley's mother was more overprotective and strict than anyone she'd ever seen.</p>
<p>"I see you're feeling better." Lilly sat on the bench opposite of Miley with a smile. Multiple plates and cups littered the table, all in various stages of being filled. Miley had been in the process of shoving a huge piece of pancake into her mouth when Lilly sat down. She grinned anyway.</p>
<p>"I feel great."</p>
<p>Lilly looked over the plates, eyebrows raised. There were the essential fries doused in Tabasco, as well as separate plates of bacon, hash browns, scrambled eggs and pancakes. Miley had them arrayed in a half-circle around herself, just within easy reach. She was wolfing down the food faster than Lilly thought possible. "Slow down, road kill, you'll choke."</p>
<p>Miley laughed and shook her head, "You sound like momma." She grabbed the bottle of Tabasco and dumped a healthy amount onto her pancake. Lilly pushed down the nausea and averted her eyes from the spectacle. Miley looked at her. "You want some?"</p>
<p>Lilly almost laughed at the serious look on the girl's face. "Uh no, I'm good."</p>
<p>Miley nodded, turning her attention back to her food. She ate the whole pancake in less than thirty seconds, shoving some hash browns after it for good measure. She looked back at Lilly, who was watching her with a look bordering on disbelief. "Grandma really liked you. She said I should invite you over for dinner again."</p>
<p>Lilly slowly met Miley's eyes, trying to think of a valid excuse. She would say 'yes' in a heartbeat if it were only Miley and her; she could even deal with grandma, but there was no way she could handle the trifecta again as she had last Friday. Miley's blue eyes were open and inviting, completely without guile or judgment and Lilly smiled.</p>
<p>"Sure, that'd be great," said Lilly and in a way she meant it. She loved being around Miley and perhaps spending more time with the girl's family would allow her to finally unravel the mystery.</p>
<p>Miley smiled sheepishly. "I won't spill my soup on you next time, either, I promise."</p>
<p>"I'm gonna hold you to that."</p>
<p>Miley reached for the Tabasco again, only to find it empty. She frowned then got up to grab another bottle from the bar. A hand shot out to grab her wrist and Miley turned to the older man sitting on one of the stools. He held her wrist in a vice-like grip, though did not look at her eyes.</p>
<p>"What in the Sam hell do you think you're doing?"</p>
<p>Miley looked confused. "I…just needed some more Tabasco."</p>
<p>"Don't get smart with me, girl. You got some nerve comin' into town like this," hissed the man, still holding onto Miley's wrist. Lilly stood, wondering if she should intervene, but had no idea <b>what</b> she would do.</p>
<p>"I'm with momma. Can you let go now, please?" said Miley, her voice completely even.</p>
<p>He seemed to just pull her closer. "You watch yourself, girl. I ain't scared of you."</p>
<p>"Ed, you let go of my daughter right now, or you'll be wearing this cup of coffee."</p>
<p>Lilly turned to see Miley's mom standing behind the bar, a look of such fury on her face she was turning red. The man nevertheless let go of Miley, holding his hands up as if he had done nothing wrong. He turned to the woman. "You still protect her, after everythin' she done…to you and your own! Wake up, Susan, wake up."</p>
<p>He mumbled something incoherent and slapped some bills on the bar, before getting up. He left, the eyes of the other patrons following him out the door and returning to stare at Miley apprehensively. Miley smiled at her mother, before returning to the booth with her bottle of Tabasco. She sat and continued eating as if nothing had happened. Lilly gaped at her, but sat back down as well, stunned into silence. She didn't understand this town and she certainly didn't understand Miley. Though perhaps this had shed some light on Susan's over protectiveness and why Miley always hung out in the diner. It seemed whereas the townspeople feared or hated Miley, they at least still respected her mother enough not to bother the girl in her presence. At least until today.</p>
<p>"Miley…" said Lilly, voice shaky. If Miley was acting like nothing had happened, maybe it had happened too many times to upset her. The girl looked up, blue eyes unconcerned.</p>
<p>"You don't look so good, Lilly. Here, have some pancake." Miley pushed the plate over to her and Lilly grabbed the fork to take a bite. She'd completely forgotten about the hot-sauce and nearly choked as the piece hit her mouth. She reached for Miley's water glass in panic.</p>
<p>Miley looked at her apologetically. "I forgot about the Tabasco, sorry. But at least the color's come back to your face."</p>
<p>Before Lilly could make a comment, Susan sat in the booth next to Miley. She no longer looked furious, but concern was clearly etched on her features. Her eyes met Lilly's as if in silent understanding. The woman sighed and turned to look at her daughter. Miley stopped, forkful of hash browns in mid-air and furrowed her brows. "What's wrong, momma?"</p>
<p>The woman smiled and brushed some hair from her daughter's eyes. "Sweet pea, maybe you and Lilly should get out of here for a bit. You can take the truck; go back to the farm and hang out there."</p>
<p>Lilly saw the offer as a mere ploy to get Miley out of town and away from all the crazy people, but Miley seemed to have no such misgivings. She smiled, almost excited. It was as if she either had no concept of ulterior motives or she just didn't care. "Alright. Lilly, I can show you the chickens. There's an evil one named Burt who bit me last week."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled in spite of herself and nodded. As long as she got to hang out with Miley it was fine with her. Susan handed Miley the keys and kissed the girl's forehead, before returning to work. Miley practically jumped up in excitement, taking one last bite of her Tabasco pancakes and rushed towards the door. Lilly followed at a much more calm pace.</p>
<p>The ride was anything but subdued. Miley dug through a heap of stuff behind her seat, eyes on the road, and triumphantly held up a cassette tape. She haphazardly shoved it into the cassette player and the whiny sounds of a tape having been played too many times filled the cabin. It was an 80s song Lilly actually recognized, though she would certainly not have sung along at top volume as Miley was doing. Lilly couldn't help but smile, however; not only did Miley have an awesome voice, but she was also too cute for words. So she just sat, watching her friend.</p>
<p>"I come home in the morning light, my mother says 'When you gonna live your life right?' Oh, mother, dear, we're not the fortunate ones, and girls, they wanna have fu-un…hey, why aren't you singing, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Lilly made a face, "I uh, don't know the words." It wasn't the complete truth, but she was a horrible singer and there was no way she'd want to drown out Miley's voice with her own wailing.</p>
<p>Miley made a swift turn off the paved road and Lilly looked around. She was not going towards her grandma's house. "Miley, where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Oh, just a little detour," grinned Miley, speeding up. The truck bounced and shook going across the ruts and holes in the dirt. Lilly held onto the door, wondering if she'd been wrong all along and Miley <b>was</b> out to kill her.</p>
<p>"Your mom said to go straight to your house." Lilly couldn't believe she'd met someone who had turned <b>her</b> into the good kid following the rules.</p>
<p>Miley made a face. "Do you always do what your mom says, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Another swift turn pushed Lilly into the door. It had rained for several days earlier in the week and there were still a lot of mud and puddles around. "I try to stay out of trouble at least, yeah, something you should've learned by now how to do."</p>
<p>Perhaps hearing the slight annoyance in her voice made Miley stop and she practically slammed on the brakes. She turned to Lilly, a serious look on her face. "I just wanna show you something, Lils. Then we'll go hang out with the chickens, okay?"</p>
<p>Lilly groaned, knowing she couldn't say 'no' to that face. Miley grinned and rolled up her window, motioning for Lilly to do the same. Lilly did as instructed, though somewhat apprehensively. Miley slammed on the gas pedal again and the old truck lumbered forward, picking up speed. They hit a mostly open, muddy area with a few hills to the side and center and Miley looked so excited, Lilly couldn't help but be worried. Miley skidded the truck around a hill, mud splashing across the windshield and side. She laughed, swerving around the other side and Lilly could do nothing but hold onto the door handle and hope to survive.</p>
<p>Miley pulled up in front of a larger, steep hill, nothing but dirt and grass, and stopped. She used the windshield wipers to clear off the mud and Lilly noticed tire tracks going up the side of the hill. It was a pretty steep angle and Lilly sat up straight. "Miley…what are you doing?"</p>
<p>Miley grinned. "Don't worry, Lilly."</p>
<p>But Lilly did worry. Miley stepped on the gas and the truck lurched forward, going up the impossibly steep incline. Lilly yelled, holding on for dear life, but Miley merely laughed. The truck went up three-fourths of the way and Miley pulled the handbrake, turning off the ignition. The truck sat at a near ninety-degree angle, as if suspended in air. Lilly was freaking out, but Miley leaned back, staring out the windshield at the blue sky.</p>
<p>"Miley, if we die, I will kill you!"</p>
<p>Miley laughed again and reached for Lilly's hand. She intertwined their fingers and Lilly's mind suddenly felt blank. Why had she been angry? Her heart was thundering, but she knew it must be from the warm hand wrapped around hers. She looked at Miley, who wore a content smile.</p>
<p>"Just relax, Lilly, look how pretty the sky is."</p>
<p>Lilly let herself relax against the seat, feeling the pull of gravity and stared out the windshield. It was a beautiful day, blue sky and white clouds as far as they could see. Miley rolled open the window again, and a warm breeze, smelling of grass and mud, blew through the cabin. Lilly had to admit, it was calm and peaceful and beautiful, but that didn't mean she'd forgive Miley for nearly giving her a heart attack. She noticed movement from the corner of her eye and suddenly warm lips were pressed against hers.</p>
<p>Lilly was too stunned to reciprocate, eyes suddenly staring at Miley's face right in front of hers. Miley's lips were soft and gentle, her kiss feathery light and it only lasted about a second before she pulled away. A huge grin split her face as she met Lilly's eyes. Lilly could not move, nor speak, nor think, too confused and shocked by what had just happened. Miley sat back in her seat and started the truck, before releasing the handbrake. She let them roll down the hill and drove at a much more subdued pace back towards the road.</p>
<p>"We better get back and hose off this truck, before momma finds out where I was."</p>
<p>Lilly just stared at the girl. Miley apparently had a propensity of acting like nothing had happened no matter what occurred. Had she actually just kissed her or had Lilly just imagined it? But her lips tingled and her whole body felt as if it were on fire. Lilly touched a hand to her lips, reverently then stopped herself. She couldn't believe what a fool she was. Lilly knew, without a doubt, she was falling for this girl, but she had no clue, despite the kiss, how Miley really felt about her. It was impossible to read the girl and her exuberance and spontaneity made it hard to decipher whether that kiss meant what Lilly wanted it to. And, Lilly thought ruefully, I never even kissed her back.</p>
