<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 5-->

<p>&#34;Goddess, Cordy,&#34; Buffy whined sleepily.</p>

<p>It felt like she and Willow had only just fallen asleep when Cordy came
bouncing into the bedroom.  She was there to demand that Buffy come with her
to the seamstress for the final fitting.  Buffy had missed one of the
fittings because she had still been recovering from her illness.  Even now,
her mind shied away from memories of that ambush.</p>

<p>&#34;But, at least we were able to save the ones last night,&#34; she mumbled under
her breath.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>&#34;I said, you've made me go to that dungeon three times already, isn't that
enough torture, or do your especially hate me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, no, Miss Almighty Slayer,&#34; the beautiful brunette scolded. &#34;You know
for someone that's supposed to be so tough you sure are a baby about the
little things.&#34;  Cordy put on her best Queen C face. &#34;Now get your cute
little butt out of that damn bed and get dressed! If you are lucky to get
someone as great as Willow to marry you than you should be happy to do this
for her.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, do you really think I've got a cute little butt, Cordy?&#34; Buffy asked,
with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.  Buffy knew that there was no way
she should do what she was about to do-but she just felt too good to pass up
the chance to get one up on Cordy.</p>

<p>So, she pulled back the covers revealing her nude body to her painfully
straight friend. &#34;And here I was afraid it was getting too big, what do you
think?&#34;</p>

<p>The look on Cordelia's face was priceless!  &lt;&gt; She shoots and scores. &lt;&gt;
Buffy thought.</p>

<p>&#34;I...ah...well...oh...it's...I don't....&#34; Cordy stammered confused and
embarrassed by all the exposed Slayer flesh. &#34;You...really...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was enjoying her friend's dilemma far too much to let her off the
hook.  It wasn't everyday that Cordelia Chase turned as red as an apple! So
in order to fluster the girl even further Buffy yawned and stretched like a
pampered cat, all the time watching Cordy fidget.</p>

<p>&#34;BUFFY!&#34; a familiar voice screamed at her as Willow appeared in the doorway
to their bedroom. &#34;Will you please leave poor Cordelia alone and get out of
that bed this minute.&#34;  Buffy looked up as the Witch stalked into the room
with both hands on her hips.  She closely resembled her mother at that very
moment.</p>

<p>&#34;Really, I can't leave you alone for a second without you pulling something
like this.&#34; Her incredible lover continued to scold her. &#34;What am I going to
do with you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ooooh, something wickedly nasty, I hope.&#34; Buffy purred sexily not quite
ready to let Cordy off the hook yet.  The exhibitionist slayer rose to a
sitting position and to Cordy's further frustration stretched again this
time for real.</p>

<p>&#34;Besides she started it.&#34; She said as she winked at her lover to join in the
fun.  &#34;Cordelia told me 'I had a cute little butt.'&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She what!&#34; Willow exclaimed incredulously, trying hard to maintain an
indignant pose. &#34;Cordelia Chase are you in here flirting with my fiancee?
You just stay away from her she's taken.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordy opened to her mouth to say something-but nothing came out.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, that's a first,&#34; the tiny slayer laughed from the bed.  &#34;Cordelia
Chase speechless!&#34;  Unable to keep her serious look any longer the witch
broke out laughing and was soon followed by a now covered Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I never...&#34; Cordy began unable to keep from smiling herself.</p>

<p>&#34;We know you never, not with us anyway.  I think that's why she teases you
so much.&#34; Willow explained to her friend. &#34;That and you're her match.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, hey, in the room, here!&#34; The blonde spoke from the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Oops, sorry honey,&#34; Willow apologize.</p>

<p>&#34;S'kay, you can make it up to me later.&#34; She winked again at her lover, this
time full of promises for later.</p>

<p>Then all three girls laughed as the reason for why Cordy was running so
later herself flashed across her face.  Buffy didn't think it was possible
for someone's face to be so red.</p>

<p>&#34;C'mon Cordy, I'll feed you breakfast while the flasher over there gets
dressed.&#34; Willow took the now fully embarrassed Cordy downstairs.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Knowing that Buffy and Cordelia would be busy at the fitting for most of the
day
Willow's mother decided to take advantage of their absence to ambush her
daughter.</p>

<p>Sheila Rosenberg had never been quite comfortable with her daughter's
lifestyle choices and now she had fallen in love with that Bunny person.
She thought not.  Willow may have fooled Ira, but she was no one's fool.  If
her daughter insisted on having this fiasco then the least they could do was
have a normal wedding! Or at least a semi-normal wedding, since it was with
another a girl.  And by normal Sheila meant the wedding She had always
wanted.</p>

<p>Then that Bunny person had foiled her plans by having her awful friend, that
Chase girl do the planing, and doing it all wrong to boot!  If she did say
so herself, which she did.</p>

<p>Sheila had fought Cordelia tooth and nail over every decision from the
napkins, (what was wrong with paper, didn't that Chase girl know how much a
cleaning bill for linen would be?)  To the actual wedding party, of course
the Blums from Nebraska had to be invited, their Great Grandfather had been
on the boat with great cousin Josh, once removed!</p>

<p>But the absolutely final straw was when she saw what her daughter was
wearing for the ceremony. Why, oh, why did Willow insist on that Bunny being
the bride?  Why? Because they wanted to put her, Sheila Rosenberg who had
suffered through 14 grueling hours of labor to bring Willow into the world,
into an early grave, that's why.</p>

<p>And on this one point Sheila Louise Rosenberg, Ph.D., was not going to give
in-her lovely, wonderful, daughter was going to be the bride!  Or else!
Besides, she had read about women couples and roles, and she knew that Bunny
was the &#34;man&#34; of the house.</p>

<p>So she waited until that awful Chase woman carted off Bunny to the final
fitting just so she could get her daughter alone.  If she had to she would
pull out the heavy duty guns-her father's bad heart.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>When Cordelia stopped her car in front of the townhouse Buffy let out a loud
sigh of relief, she was so glad to be finally home. This had been as close
to a day from the darkest pit of Hades, as she'd had in a while.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Cordelia asked getting out of her car.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; the slayer answered, following her, as she noticed a familiar car
parked in front of them.  &#34;Say, isn't that Mrs. Rosenberg's car?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, it can't be....&#34; Cordelia answered her.</p>

<p>Then Buffy's Slayer ears heard arguing coming from her house, and having an
idea what was going on the Slayer growled and stomped off toward the front
door with Cordelia following close behind her.</p>

<p>As they approached the front door the voices could be clearly heard. Buffy
and Cordelia looked at each other and groaned both knowing exactly what was
happening on the other side of the door.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Willow's head was pounding like there was a jackhammer in there trying to
get out. Her mother had been there for over 2 hours alternating between
yelling, whining, and browbeating.  All her arguments were also seasoned
liberally with a large dose of guilt.</p>

<p>Her mother was totally off the deep end about everything concerning the
wedding. All the details were up for grabs from her choice of clothing to
her role as the groom.</p>

<p>What had begun as a minor irritating throbbing at the back of Willow's skull
had grown into a full-fledged-sight-blurring-nausea causing, knee buckling
migraine.</p>

<p>Finally, the small Wyccan had taken just about all she could stand from her
&#34;loving&#34; mother.</p>

<p>&#34;Really Willow are you trying to embarrass your entire family with this
behavior!&#34; Sheila Rosenberg continued to screech.  She was seemingly enraged
by her own daughter's obstinacy.</p>

<p>&#34;I just don't know what has gotten into you. After all I've done for you,
this is how you repay me?&#34;</p>

<p>At that point Willow lost it.</p>

<p>&#34;What's that mother?&#34; the red head snapped. &#34;All you've done for me, mother.
What have you done for me mother?&#34;  Willow said quietly, least her head
would split wide open on the spot.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, lets see?  You were never there for me when I was lost and alone in
school.&#34;  The witch's said as her headache suddenly started getting better.
&#34;Oh, what else, do you know the humiliation of going to the school nurse to
learn about my menstrual cycle? Well?  What did you do for me then?&#34;</p>

<p>Now that she had started to pour out all her pent up emotions she couldn't
stop. &#34;The only person I ever had growing up was Xander and you treated him
like dirt.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, he was dirt, from the wrong side of town!&#34; Sheila retaliated.</p>

<p>&#34;Crap, mother he was my only friend until I got to high school!&#34; Willow
stood and walked over to the window remembering the day she met Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Then I met Giles and Buffy and Oz who treated me like a valuable person,
Mother, part of a team!&#34; The Witch turned back to her mother and saw the
hurt and anger on her face.  But, it only served to enrage the young woman
more, &#34;I was in love with Oz or at least thought I was....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;See this is what I mean,&#34; Sheila pounced.  &#34;You thought you were in love
with that dreadful musician-and now you 'think' you are in love with that
girl!  I just want to keep you from making the same awful mistake again!&#34;</p>

<p>Willow stalked over to mother, fury blazing in her eyes. &#34;That is just so
much stuff, mother.  I found a real true love in Buffy and then I almost
lost her because I was afraid it would embarrass you and Daddy!&#34;</p>

<p>Thinking about her Slayer made all the hurt and anger drain away from
Willow.</p>

<p>She added, speaking softly, &#34;I have a chance to be happy with someone that
loves me more than life itself.  But you wouldn't know about that, would
you?  If you did you would be happy for us instead of sitting here
screaming.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow could see that her mother was beyond livid.  The witch would place a
bet that none of her students had ever spoken to her like that before.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow Rosenberg, how dare you speak to me like that?&#34; Mrs. Rosenberg
yelled, outraged by what the young redhead was sure she felt was her
daughter's disrespectful outburst.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know who has led you to believe that you can just run over my
feelings this way, but I have an idea. I just know it was that Bunny that
put you up to this!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;One more time my name is Buffy that's B-U-F-F-Y, Buffy.&#34; Willow's lover and
protector said calmly from the doorway. The two Rosenberg women turned and
looked at the petite blonde that was leaning casually on the doorframe. From
the power radiating off her Willow could tell that her Slayer was in a mood.</p>

<p>&#34;Now would someone tell me where you get off coming here and treating my
fiancee this way?&#34; The Blonde asked.</p>

<p>One set of green eyes looked at the slayer with complete love, adoration,
and gratitude for her timely entrance.  Another, identical set of green eyes
narrowed in anger at the interruption.</p>

<p>&#34;I have every right to be here this is my daughter's home after all.&#34; Sheila
Rosenberg huffed haughtily.</p>

<p>&#34;True, very true,&#34; Buffy agreed as she walked slowly over to her Wills and
took the witch in her arms. &#34;But you see it's my home too and when you barge
in here and try to force the woman I love to bow down to your
selfishness--then my only recourse is to tell you to get out.&#34; She finished
calmly.</p>

<p>It was all Willow could take, so the girl turned to face the Slayer and
buried her face in the blonde's chest and started crying.</p>

<p>Her mother began to say something rude, but Buffy guessed the woman's
intention and cut her off.</p>

<p>&#34;I said leave Mrs. Rosenberg!&#34; Buffy growled angrily. &#34;You've done quite
enough already.&#34;</p>

<p>Seeing that she had lost this battle over the wedding and quite possibly
more, Willow's mother wisely shut her mouth and left without another word.</p>

<p>&#34;How much of that did you hear?&#34; Willow asked after the door slammed shut.
Hoping her slayer hadn't heard much of her infuriated speech.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh lover,&#34; Buffy started, lifting Willow's head so they were looking into
each other's eyes. &#34;I heard everything and I must say I am so proud to call
you my soulmate and lover!&#34;</p>

<p>Willow kissed her beloved slayer lightly then was pulled into another far
more passionate kiss by her soon to be wife.</p>

<p>The kiss lasted until Cordelia cleared her throat.</p>

<p>&#34;Geese you two give it a rest already.&#34; She said grumbly, &#34;I've had to deal
with that woman ever since you two put me in charge and nobody's rewarded me
like that!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What's the matter Cordy? Jealous?&#34; Willow quipped to tease their friend.</p>

<p>Cordelia scoffed at her accusation.</p>

<p>&#34;I told you, she thinks I got a cute butt,&#34; Buffy stated joining her lover
in the fun.</p>

<p>&#34;I...you...we...I mean I thought we covered that this morning.&#34; Cordelia
cried demurely showing off her acting skills. &#34;I mean I wouldn't dare covet
you, Buffy, imagine what Will would do to me? Besides if I was after anyone,
it would be Will, her's is cuter.&#34;</p>

<p>Both girls stared slack jawed at the grinning brunette.</p>

<p>&#34;I still got it!&#34; Queen C announced.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent going over details for the wedding and going
back and correcting the things they found that Willow's mother had secretly
changed.</p>

<p>Once again Cordy was an invaluable asset when it came to figuring out where
the overbearing woman had messed with their plans.</p>

<p>All three agreed that while they looked forward to the public event, they
would be glad to get it over with.</p>

<p>&#34;At least those Wyccan friends of yours from San Francisco knew some members
of a local Grove to help them set up the joining.&#34; Buffy sighed, &#34;We aren't
allowed to have anything to do with that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah I guess so,&#34; Willow said wistfully. &#34;It would have been easy
considering it's all written down so there's no guess work, like with this
little monster we've created here.&#34;</p>

<p>The three friends laughed then returned to finalizing the details of the
public wedding and the required reception that followed it.  Buffy and
Willow were very late for patrol that night.</p>
