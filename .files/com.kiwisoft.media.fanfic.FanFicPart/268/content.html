<!-- Love Me \ Story -->

<P>"I knew it."</P>

<P>"It was obvious."</P>

<P>"Wow."</P>

<P>"Can I watch?  Ow.  Just kidding.  So how are you going to tell her?"</P>

<P>"That is why I have called you all down here.  I will need your help."</P>

<P>"Well, I'm in.  What do we have to do?"</P>

<P>"Doctor I will need you to play the piano.  Lt. Paris I will need you to play the guitar.  Ensign Kim I will need you to play the clarinet.  And Commander Chakotay I will need you to play the drums as I will sing."</P>

<P>"You're going to tell Lanna you love her by singing to her?  That is just so romantic."  Harry gushed.</P>

<P>"I already have the song selected as well as the holoprogram I will run I only needed to acquire some help in order to have a 'band' accompany my singing.  I have choosen each of you beacuse of your musical inclinations.  Are you willing to participate?"</P>

<P>"You betcha."</P>

<P>"I'd be happy to."</P>

<P>"Wouldn't miss this for the world."</P>

<P>"Count me in too."</P>

<P>"Good, since you are all willing then I have set up a practice schedule and reseved the required holodeck time to practice.  These are the times in which we shall meet to learn the song.  Thank you for your help." Just as suddenly as Seven had dropped her shocker she had spun around and left sickbay just as quick.</P>

<hr>

<P>"Come on Harry, we're going to be late.  Umph.  Gee, I'm so sorry Captain.  Guess I should look where I'm running."</P>

<P>"That would be adviseable.  Now where are you too running to and what are you so late for?"</P>

<P>"The holodeck, we have a practice session.  Ouf."  Tom elbowed Harry in the ribs.  "But we really should get going now.  Bye."</P>

<P>"A practice session for what?"</P>

<P>"Uhhh."</P>

<P>"It's just a, uh racing program captain."</P>

<P>"Harry?"</P>

<P>&lt;sigh&gt; "Actually it's a jam session, captain."</P>

<P>"Harry!  You were a momma's boy growing up weren't you?"</P>

<P>"Paris that's enough.  So Mr. Kim,what's a jam session?"</P>

<P>"It's actually a music session in which we get together and play musical instruments.  And to answer your next question I play the clarinet, Tom plays guitar, the Doc plays the piano, Chakotay the drums, and Seven sings."</P>

<P>"Really?  So planning on a public appearance soon?  I'm sure Neelix would like to organize a little showing maybe some tables to sit and eat at.  Like a dinner theater except we have a musical performance.  I would just love to see Seven sing."  </P>

<P>"Well, this was Seven's idea so you'd have to ask her."</P>

<P>"Seven's idea?!"</P>

<P>"What was my idea?"  Seven came upon the group standing in the middle of the corridor.</P>

<P>"The band.  Wh didn't you tell me about?  You know we have to do a public appearnce.  The crew would just love to see Voyager's own band."</P>

<P>"I..... it was.... but...... Fine captain.  We shall put on a public show though we have only been studying one song.  In four days time we will be prepared to perform.  Now i you will excuse us we have practicing to do."</P>

<P>"By all means.  And I'll let Neelix know what's going on."</P>

<hr>

<P>Four days later and Neelix managed to set up a sort of talent night show.  In the holodeck was a simple bar setting in which had a stage as well as tables and chairs set up.  But for a bar in was a very well lite non-smokey place.  Dinner was served earlier and then the show began. Saving the best for last was what the crew began to nickname as the VCB, Voyager's Crew Band.  It still was only one song in which the band was to perform but since it was done live it was the most anticipated event of the evening.</P>

<P>"Is she here?"</P>

<P>"Yes Seven, she's sitting at a table almost center, alone."</P>

<P>"But I'd watch out for the captain as well.  She's sitting over off to the right and boy has she been throwing you the puppy dog eyes all night.  When you're up on the stage don't look at her.  Wouldn't want to give Lanna any wrong ideas."</P>

<P>"Thank you Tom for all you help.  I......."</P>

<P>["And now the moment you've all been waiting for.  Presenting for the first time anywhere in the galaxy, the VCB"]</P>

<P>"Guess that's our cue."</P>

<hr>

<P>The house lights had been dimmed and the stage lights completely shut off.  That is until the music began.  A soft slow melody floated out behind the darkness and slowly the lights were brought up as well. First the band was illuminated and then the spot light shown bright as the music picked up tempo.  Seven swayed her hips to the beat waiting for the right time to begin the song.</P>

<P>'Who knew Seven had it in her to sway her hips let alone look so god damned sexy doing it.'  Lanna thought to herself.  She quickly took a look around the room and saw that she wasn't the only one mesmerized by the beauty on stage.  Brining her eyes back to the stage she saw Seven look up and directly at her, through her as she parted her lips to sing.</P>

<P><I>A thousand years, a thousand more <BR>
A thousand times a million doors to eternity <BR>
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times <BR>
An endless turning stairway climbs <BR>
To a tower of souls If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars <BR>
The towers rise to numberless floors in space <BR>
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths <BR>
A million names but only one truth to face</I></P>

<P>
Seven had the audience enraptured as the band played on behind her but she only had eyes for one woman and that woman only had eyes for her.</P>

<P>
<I>A million roads, a million fears <BR>
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty <BR>
I could speak a million lies, a million songs <BR>
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time <BR>
But if there was a single truth, a single light <BR>
A single thought, a single touch of grace <BR>
Then following this single point, this single flame <BR>
This single haunted memory of your face</I></P>

<P>
Seven at that point had closed her eyes as if seeing this haunted face in her minds eye while she continued to sing.</P>

<P><I>
I still love you I still want you <BR>
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves <BR>
Like galaxies in my head</I></P>

<P>
Opening her eyes again Seven let go.  She showed whoever was paying close attention who she really was underneth all of that borg exterior as she sang the words that so perfectly dexcribed her.</P>

<P><I>
I may be numberless, I may be innocent <BR>
I may know many things, I may be ignorant <BR>
Or I could ride with kings and conquor many lands <BR>
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands <BR>
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times <BR>
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes <BR>
Or wear this pilgram's cloak, or be a common theif <BR>
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief</I></P>

<P>
<BR>
Seven's eyes glowed as she declared her love to the woman sitting only a few feet away.</P>

<P><I>
I still love you I still want you <BR>
A thousand times these mysteries unfold themselves <BR>
Like galaxies in my head <BR>
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves <BR>
Eternities still unsaid 'Till you love me</I></P>

<P>
As Seven sang the last line it not only was the last line of the song but also a heartfelt plea sent out to the only person she truely ever did care for.</P>

<P>A chorus of cheers and whistles rang out as people stood to applaud the band but Seven heard none of it.  She found herself in a daze as she walked down to meet a now standing B'Elanna Torres.  And in the background as the cheers died down the band keyed up for another playing of the song, this time with the Doctor as lead vocalist.  Torres met Seven half way down from the stage and naturally fell into the taller woman's arms as she pulled her in for a slow dance to the music now playing.  The world around them did not exist.  Not the people, not the place, not the time.  It was only them and the music.  As the chorus began Seven icked up the cue and followed along whispering the words in B'Elanna's ear.</P>

<P><I>I still love you <BR>
I still want you</I></P>

<P>Slowly the women made their way around the make shift dance floor each holding on to the other for dear life.  Arms tightened, breaths mingled, eyes staring into the depts of the matching pair of eyes.  The time for the chorus soon came up again but instead of Seven singing it, Lanna beat her to it.</P>

<P><I>I still love you <BR>
I still want you</I></P>

<P>And again when the last line of the song came even pleaded,</P>

<P><I>Love Me</I></P>

<P>
"Janeway to Seven of Nine."</P>

<P>"Seven of Nine here, go ahead captain."</P>

<P>"Please meet me in astrometrics."</P>

<P>"Acknowleged, Seven out."  As Seven shut down the comm link a single tear escaped her eye as she looked into the questioning gaze of her true love.  "Computer, end program."</P>

<P>Seven left a now empty holodeck.  </P>
