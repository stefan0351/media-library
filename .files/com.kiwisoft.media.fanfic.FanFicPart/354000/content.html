<!-- The Closet \ Part Twenty-One -->

<p>Lily ran a hand through her hair nervously as she eyed the girl  beside her.  She wasn't so sure about this.  It wasn't that she  really disagreed with Carmen's interpretation of the text, in fact  she fully agreed with it, it was just that what the taller girl was  proposing was kind of illegal.</p>

<p>"Carm, I'm not so sure about this," Lily said finally.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Harrison said pointing at Lily.  "See, she thinks you're  insane too.  I mean, I didn't really want to use the `i' word but,  well, somebody had to say it."</p>

<p>"Actually," Lily interjected.  "I kinda do agree with her.  I'm just  not to keen on the breaking and entering."</p>

<p>"You agree with her?" Harrison asked, his eyes widening.  "Come on  Lily, this is Brooke and Sam we're talking about.  They're not that  way.  I think that I know a little something about the lesbian way of  life, living with two of them and all, and I think I can safely say  that Brooke and Sam aren't," he went on.  "Trust me."</p>

<p>"This doesn't have anything to do with trust.  And it's not like  baldness, you can't just tell by looking at someone," Carmen  responded.  "And we're not doing anything wrong, we just have to get  Sam away from Brooke for a while so we can talk to her."</p>

<p>"I'm not doing it," Harrison said holding up his hands.  </p>

<p>"Lily?" Carmen asked looking at the smaller girl with an expression  that conveyed that either way she was going to go ahead with her plan.</p>

<p>"Okay," Lily said sighing.  She couldn't let Carmen go it alone, and  truthfully she didn't really want to miss out on what she was sure  was going to be a juicy conversation.</p>

<p> Mary Cherry turned around her full-length mirror once more carefully  studying her reflection.</p>

<p>"Nic," she asked turning around, her brows crunched together in  thought.  "Do theez pants make mah ass look big?"</p>

<p>Nicole sighed as she pulled on her DKNY leather all-purpose  gloves.  "No Mary Cherry, the fact that your ass is big makes your  ass look big."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry turned back to the mirror with a frown.  "Whah do yah haf  to be so cruel?"</p>

<p>"Come on, we've got a head cheerleader to save," Nicole said heading  for the door.  "It's going to be a dirty job," the short - haired  blonde said seriously, her hand hovering over the doorknob.  "And  we're lucky to be the ones to do it.  Now move!"</p>

<hr>

<p>Lily tugged at her ski mask for what had to have been the billionth  time in the three-minute time span it took her and Carmen to get from  their room to Sam's.  Slipping her hand underneath the woolly  material, she fully intended to rip it off of her face when she felt  a hand grasp hers.  Carmen was holding her hand with her left hand  while her right hand was raised up to her lips in the  universal `ssssh' gesture.  Lily sighed, as Carmen let go of her hand  and took a step back.</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous!" She exclaimed only to have a hand clamped over  her mouth.  Wrenching Carmen's hand off of her face, Lily looked at  the taller girl rather peevishly.  "What are we doing?!" she  continued, this time in a softer voice.  "Look at us, we look like  rejects from I Spy!  Sam is our friend, we should just knock on the  door and…"</p>

<p>"Sssh," Carmen interjected putting up her hand.</p>

<p>"I don't think that that was necessary.  I was merely saying that…"  Lily tried to explain but Carmen interrupted her again.</p>

<p>"Sssh," the taller brunette repeated again.  "Listen to that."</p>

<p>Lily was silent for a moment as leaned her ear in the direction  Carmen pointed.  At first she didn't hear anything, but then she  could detect a faint scratching sound, and what sounded like whispers.</p>

<p>"What is that?" Lily asked turning her attention back to the other  girl.</p>

<p>"Only one way to find out," Carmen responded rounding the corner.</p>

<p> "Southern Comfort to Mrs. Deville, Southern Comfort to Mrs. Deville… ovah," Mary Cherry whispered into the walkie-talkie clutched in her  hand, as she ducked her head around from side to side suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Are you sure your parents aren't related?" Nicole whispered harshly  as she yanked the Southerner down into a crouching position.  It was  so hard to find competent help these days.  "Just shut that vacuous  hole you call a mouth for a moment won't you, I'm almost done."</p>

<p>"Awr you shur that these pants don't make mah ass look big?" Mary  Cherry asked unaware that Nicole had even spoken.  She had learned  that you didn't really need to listen to what Nicole was saying, you  just had nod your head and agree with her vigorously.  So, with that  knowledge in mind, she had turned to a detailed examination to see  what her own buttocks looked like in a crouched position.</p>

<p>"Did I just tell you to shut your…" Nicole started to say,  momentarily turning her attention away from the lock picks in her  hand, when she froze.  Curse, Mary Cherry and her loud, grating  voice.  The Southerner had managed to distract her just long enough  for the doofus twins to locate them.</p>

<p>Quickly standing up, Nicole made her way over to Lily and Carmen  before the halfwits could open their mouths and alert someone to  their presence.  Stupid Bio Glass and her bloody strict curfew.   Slapping a hand over Carmen's mouth and dragging her back around the  corner into the stairwell, Nicole watched as Mary Cherry grabbed Lily  and did the same.  Once safely hidden away in the concrete well,  Nicole and Mary Cherry removed their hands from over the brunettes  mouths and stepped back, making mental notes to buy some anti- bacterial soap before bringing their hands anywhere near their own  flesh again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Brooke continued to move backwards until she felt backs of her legs  hit the bed.  Turning around to look at the object that had impeded  her back peddling, she steadied herself then turned her attention  back to Sam, who was watching her with a debaucherous grin on her  face.  Brooke smiled down at her momentarily before ducking her head  forward and capturing Sam's lips with her own, as the brunette gave  one last push sending them both toppling down onto the bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Listen Krispy Crème," Nicole stated sticking her finger in Carmen's  face and waving it around for good measure.  "You and Cousin It were  sneaking around down there, so don't even think about hauling your  fat ass up on to a soapbox and lecturing me!" the shorthaired blonde  continued.  "There are two ways this meeting can end, my way and my  way, so listen closely.  We're both after the same thing here, to  find out what's going on with Cinderella and the soon to be step- troll, so we could as well work together.  Now, before we were so  rudely interrupted, I was about 5.3 seconds away from getting that  lock open, so you two can either come quietly, or Mary Cherry can  show you how they handled interlopers on her uncle's hog farm.  So,  what's it gonna be?"</p>

<p>"We'll be right back," Carmen whispered grabbing Lily by the arm and  pulling her to the other end of the stairwell.  </p>

<p>Nicole watched with growing boredom as they argued with each other,  Carmen's hands waving in the air and pointing at her palm before,  they finally seemed to come to an agreement.</p>

<p>"We accept the conditions of your proposal," Carmen said coming back  over to Nicole.  "Now let's get the hell over with, you two are  giving me hives."</p>

<hr>

<p>"Do you hear something?" Brooke asked, though she herself was  becoming more and more distracted the more Sam's hand crept up her  shirt.</p>

<p>"Only you," Sam responded.  "I want to hear more of that, only this  time along the lines of `ummm ohhhh'" Sam continued making the  appropriate faces to go along with her sound effects.</p>

<p>"You're a dirty girl aren't you?" Brooke asked with a smile, her  worries about mysteries noises long forgotten.  "I like that."</p>

<hr>

<p>Snapping the lid of her lock pick set closed Nicole stood up and  turned around to face the girls assembled behind her.  Mary Cherry  seemed to be using her compact mirror to look at Lily's ass, while  Lily orbited Carmen's body trying to escape Mary Cherry tyrannical  grasps.  Nicole sighed, freaks and losers surrounded her.  Whatever  had she done to deserve this.</p>

<p>"If you all are quite finished now," she began in a harsh  whisper.  "Our friends await."</p>

<p>Carefully opening the door, Nicole lead the pack of girls inside of  the darkened hotel room, closing the door quietly once everyone was  inside.  Moving slightly to the side she carefully extended her hand  and began to feel along the wall for a light switch, a wicked smile  working it's way across her face as her finger connected with the  stub.  </p>

<p>Just then she heard a nose emerge from the darkness of the room.  It  was a noise Nicole knew well, it was a sexual, desperate, highly  aroused moan.  Deciding right then and there, that she absolutely had  to put a stop to whatever was going Nicole flicked her finger and the  lights turned on, showering everything in the room with bright,  embarrassing light.</p>

<p>Lily and Carmen's mouths dropped open as the stood thunderstruck at  the sight that greeted them once Nicole had flipped on the light  switch.  The scene that greeted them simply too much for their non- payperview watching minds to grasp.  Sam and Brooke, together, on the  bed.  Clothes rumpled, and hands, hands in naughty, naughty places.   They could see Brooke's bra, Sam's mouth was hovered over it, they  were, they were doing stuff.  Yes, Lily and Carmen stood watching the  scene in front of them thunderstruck.  It was too much, where oh  where had the coy glances stage gone?</p>

<p>Sam's head whipped around, and Brooke's raised off of the bed as they  blinked against the suddenly light filled room, which they could just  blurringly make out as now filled with people.  </p>

<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" Mary Cherry yelled falling to her knees, her  hands coming up to grasp the hair at the front of her head as she  stared up at the ceiling.  "WHAH?  OH DEAR GAWD WHAH?  TAKE ME!  TAKE  ME!" she cried looking back over at the bed, dark mascara streaks now  marring her features.  "Whah do they great ones leave us so young???"  she whaled her body shaking.</p>

<p>Brooke blinked as the Southerners harsh cries filled the room, her  stupor finally breaking.  Working her way out from underneath Sam she  jumped off the bed and practically flung herself at Mary Cherry  clamping a hand over her mouth.</p>

<p>"My god Mary Cherry," she whispered harshly.  "SHUT UP.  You're going  to wake up the whole floor!" Brooke continued looking around  desperately, barely noticing Sam also getting off of the bed and  walking towards their visitors.  </p>

<p>Finally when Brooke was fairly certain that Mary Cherry wouldn't  erupt into a screaming fit again she removed her hand and stood up,  backing away from the still cowering Southerner.</p>

<p>"Does somebody want to tell me what the FUCK is going on here?" Sam  asked once the room became blanketed in silence once more, her gaze  leveled at Lily and Carmen who had the good decency to look shamed. </p>

<p>"You should know the answer to that question better than anyone  shouldn't you Spam?" Nicole asked, her arms folded across her chest,  as she surveyed the play unfolding in front of her with a detached  fascination.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you!" Brooke erupted pointing at Nicole as she  spotted the small pouch in her hand and recognized it for what it  was.  "You picked the lock didn't you?!?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Brookie," Nicole said sweetly looking over at the wispy haired  blonde.  "You might wanna," she continued waving a lazy hand to  indicate Brooke's semi-torso, "before lighting into me."</p>

<p>Looking mildly confused Brooke lowered her gaze, her eyes widening  when she realized what Nicole was referring to.  "Holy god!" she  muttered, beyond mortified to realize that she wasn't wearing a  shirt.  Quickly turning around so that her back was to their visitors  she began to scan the room.</p>

<p>"Where's my shirt?" she asked, her voice raising an octave or so as  she looked over at Sam.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Sam responded her voice rising as well, as her  attention was torn between Brooke and Lily who was now looking at  Brooke with an interest Sam didn't appreciate.</p>

<p>"Where's my shirt?" Brooke repeated again, getting desperate now.   She was painfully aware of how underdressed she was, and she wanted  her shirt back now.</p>

<p>"I dunno," Sam repeated once more, now torn between scanning the room  herself and watching Mary Cherry in amazement as the girl diligently  reapplied the make-up she had ruined earlier.</p>

<p>"You're the one that took it…" Brooke trailed off, as she remembered  that there were other people in the room.</p>

<p>"Brookie," Nicole said, practically singing her name.  "Over there,"  she said waving her hand in the direction of the vanity mirror, where  horror of horrors, Brooke's shirt was hanging precariously on the  corner.</p>

<p>"What'd you use to play softball?" Brooke asked shooting Sam a look  before self-consciously removing her shirt from it's resting place  and drawing it over her head.  </p>

<p>"Tut, tut Brookie," Nicole piped up as Brooke pulled down her shirt,  finally covering all of her yummy regions.  "Those who cop feels off  of other women shouldn't lob stones," she continued observing Brooke  with a shrewd smile on her face.  "Basketballs maybe, after all,  considering your new hobby and height the WNBA might just be your  calling."</p>

<p>"Get out," Brooke said whipping around to face Nicole, her face a  study in barely controlled rage.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure you really want me to do that," Nicole said rising  up to her full height and stepping forward so that she was only a  meter away from Brooke.  "Because after the terrible trauma I just  suffered, if you cast me out I might just be forced to call everyone  I've ever met and share the horror that was you groping Spam  McPherson with them."</p>

<p>Brooke opened her mouth as if to respond when Nicole finished then  promptly closed it again.  She really hadn't even begun to  contemplate possibly hypothetically conceiving responses for Nicole  finding out about her and Sam, and bam, here it was right in front of  her.  Previously she had been functioning on mortification and  indignation to guide her, but they had left her now leaving  befuddlement in their wake.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't," Brooke said, but not only did the statement come out  sounding more like a question, Brooke also looked confused as if she  wasn't really certain what was coming out of her mouth.</p>

<p>"You!" Mary Cherry exclaimed extending an accusing finger in Sam's  direction.  "Look at what ya've done ya no neck little monsta!  Damn  bastard chald, ya've gone `n' broke Brookie with damn dirty whore  hands!" the southerner continued waving at Brooke who was still in a  stupefied stated.</p>

<p>Sam whipped around to face Mary Cherry, her features covered in  outrage.  "What!?!" she yelled at the blonde.  "And don't think that  I can't see you!" Sam yelled pointing at Lily and Carmen who had been  trying to ease themselves towards the door for a hasty escape before  the situation could get any worse.  "You two of all people," Sam  continued turning her attention away from Mary Cherry for a  moment.  "Working with Satan and Tweedle Dumb, have you suddenly gone  stupid!?!  How could you do this?  Will you still own your first born  or was that the price for this little congregation of horrors!?!" </p>

<p>"We were just coming to talk, then Nicole kidnapped us and threatened  to have Mary Cherry hog tie us if we didn't keep quiet and come along  peaceably," Carmen blurted out pointing at Nicole who merely rolled  her eyes extremely bored.  "We were just coming to say hi, see how  the incarceration was coming along, we don't know…that is to say if  had thought that…you know stuff would be happening…with you…we, you  know wouldn't have, and did I mention we were threatened?"</p>

<p>"Oh save it Carnie," Nicole responded looking at Carmen with  irritation.  "We all you that you two saw them looking at each other  like fiesta platters and wanted to find evidence that the looks were  just the result of being starved for the past two days instead of  actual erotic attraction.  Just admit it, you two were like our  retarded twins.  Besides, lil' big head over there seemed to enjoy  the show," Nicole continued grinning at Lily.  </p>

<p>"Did not!" Lily piped up immediately, looking around her to see if  anyone actually believed her.  Nicole simply seemed amused, Sam was  looking at her with a slight frown on her face, Brooke was watching  Sam watch her, Carmen seemed to be muttering to herself trying to  figure out why Nicole called her Carnie, and Mary Cherry was sniffing  one of Brooke's shoes.</p>

<p>"Okay, I've had enough of this," Brooke said her back straightening  purposefully.  "I want all of you to get out of our room like now!  I  think we've all seen quite enough of each other for one night," she  finished looking at all of them and then at the door.</p>

<p>"Um no," Nicole responded spinning around to face Brooke once more.</p>

<p>"What do you mean no?" Brooke asked looking at Nicole like she was  insane.  "I said get out."</p>

<p>"And I said that I don't think that's going to be happening anytime  soon.  I came here to get answers, tell you they're wrong and give  you the correct ones," Nicole responded calmly.  "And I'm not going  anywhere until I've shoved the light down your throat and made you  like it."</p>

<p>"Why?" Sam asked turning to look at Brooke.  "Why? Why? Why, do you  associate with her?!!"</p>

<p>"You want answers?" Brooke asked looking around the room at all of  them challengingly.  "Fine, I'll give you answers," she continued,  her indignation working up into a creamy lather, before she paused to  look at Sam.  "Is it alright if I give them answers?" she asked the  brunette, ignoring Nicole and her obnoxious hand motions.</p>

<p>"Be my guest," Sam responded smiling softly at the blonde.  Brooke  smiled back at her then turned to face their audience once more.</p>

<p>"Sam and I are together, and from what you walked in on I think you  know in what way I mean.  She had a thing, I had a thing, and so we  decided to have a thing together.  That's the way it is.  When we get  back home I'm gonna give her my cheerleading jacket, and then we'll  be going steady.  And if any of you have a problem with this you can  just suck on that real hard!" Brooke continued looking at them with  her most intimidating face on. </p>

<p>"That was impressive Brooke," Nicole responded not looking at all  impressed.  "Did you practice that one in front of the mirror?" she  continued staring at the other blonde.  "Go steady?" she asked  incredulously.  "Have your brains fallen completely into your utterly  stylish pants?  She," Nicole continued, pointing to Sam at this  point, "is the enemy.  She is a complete social retard, and  genetically I believe only slightly more complex than a howler  monkey.  If you must embrace the Angelina Jolie inside of you, I can  accept that, but you will not bring upon us all a social backspace  the likes of which Los Angeles has never before witnessed, for …  that," Nicole finished waving her hand at Sam, her voice drenched  with distaste.</p>

<p>"Howler monkey!?!" Sam exclaimed lunging at Nicole, missing the other  blonde by mere centimeters as Brooke grasped her around the waist and  pulled her back into her body.  "Let me go," Sam complained  struggling her Brooke's surprisingly strong arms.  "She called be a  bloody Howler monkey!"</p>

<p>"Sammy," Brooke said softly into Sam's ear as she fought to hold onto  the brunette.  "The direct use of force is such a poor solution to  any problem, it is generally employed only by small children and  large nations.  Calm down," Brooke continued in her most soothing  voice.</p>

<p>"Don't quote Friedman to me," Sam said tilting her head to the side  to look at Brooke.  "She called me a howler monkey!  And, you totally  stole that book from my room."</p>

<p>"Borrow Sam, borrowed," Brooke responded shooting Sam her most  charming smile hoping it would calm the irate brunette down.  </p>

<p>"You're lucky you're cute," Sam muttered, a small smile appearing on  her face nonetheless as she stopped struggling and settled back into  Brooke's arms.  Damn but she loved it when Brooke held her.</p>

<p>"This isn't a Glamazon meeting Nicole, you can bark all night but I'm  not going to bite," Brooke said looking over at Nicole as Sam rested  her head against her shoulder.  "She's my howler monkey, and I'm not  letting her go because you enjoy the creative rush you get when you  insult her.  So, somebody please, pop the cork cause it's time to  christen our new treaty with the Browns."</p>

<p>Nicole folded her arms across her chest after Brooke finished  observing the blonde shrewdly.  Finally, tilting her head up in the  air and turning her nose up she addressed the head cheerleader.  "Who  says you get say what treaties are made and unmade around here?" she  asked staring at Brooke hard.</p>

<p>"I say.  And you know why I get to?" Brooke responded meeting  Nicole's gaze unflinchingly.  "Because I'm the Queen Bee.  Now be a  good little peon and hail the queen."</p>

<p>The room was covered in silence after Brooke finished speaking,  nobody quite able to believe what they had heard come out of her  mouth.  It was a strange relationship that Brooke and Nicole had, to  insiders of the popular cliché and outsiders alike.  It was taken as  some sort of natural commandment that Nicole just stood by Brooke,  people had long ago stopped trying to figure out why because how  wispy little Brooke managed to contain a pit-bull like Nicole was  beyond their powers of reasoning.  But suddenly to the people in that  room it made sense, Nicole welded her power like a deadly weapon but  she also respected it in other people.  If she came up against  someone as strong willed as herself she would still rip into them  like a starved Panda, but she would view them as someone worthy of  her, a goddess like herself.  And nobody had been able to figure out  how the shorter blonde didn't rip Brooke a new asshole because the  cheerleader seemed like such a pushover.  But Brooke wasn't a push  over, she could dish it out to Nicole as well as Nicole gave it to  her, and that's why Nicole always stayed at her side.  In Brooke she  had finally found someone who could and would stand up to her.  Their  dynamic was all about respect.</p>

<p>And then finally when the silence seemed to grow oppressive, Nicole  smiled, and bowed her head slightly before whipping around to face  Mary Cherry.  "Let's go Gumbo," she barked snapping her fingers at  the southerner.  And with that she strode out of the room without  looking back. </p>

<p>"Wow," Carmen breathed out looking at Brooke with something close to  awe on her face once Nicole and Mary Cherry had exited the  room.  "That was the greatest thing I've seen."</p>

<p>"Didn't you once see a six year old rescue a grown man from a burning  building?" Lily asked looking over at Carmen.</p>

<p>"This was better," was Carmen's only response.</p>

<p>"I think you've got a groupie," Sam said twisting around so that she  could see Brooke's rapidly flushing face.  The fact was that she was  rather surprised by how Brooke had handled Nicole as well.  "I never  knew you were so dominant," Sam continued watching as Brooke turned a  deeper shade of red in response.</p>

<p>"It's not so amazing," Brooke said ripping her attention from Sam and  turning to face Carmen.  "You just have to know what Nicole is."</p>

<p>"Which is?" Lily asked.</p>

<p>"A two year old on a power trip with a gold card," Brooke  responded.  "If you let her get away with something she'll keep doing  it because she can, because getting away with the unacceptable amuses  her.  If you don't set limits with her, she'll set them…and you don't  want that," she continued.  "She's not really a bad person, she just  sometimes gets intoxicated by herself and doesn't know any better.   When she's acting normal, she's actually quite charming."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell me that smug bitch isn't her normal state of  being?" Sam asked looking up at Brooke unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm not saying that it's as alien to her as manual labour,  but…" Brooke responded seeing that she really wasn't convincing  anybody.  She sighed mentally, getting people to view Nicole as an  actual human being was apparently going to be the most difficult task  she'd undertaken.</p>

<p>"Well, now that the world has completely gone insane," Carmen  responded.  "I think I'm going to bed.  I have a world order to  restore before breakfast tomorrow…and of course questions to  prepare," she said looking at Sam who rolled her eyes.  "So… goodnight," she said turning around with Lily following behind her.</p>

<p>"And," Lily said, just before she and Carmen reached the  door.  "Congratulations.  We're happy for you.  Both of us.  Aren't  we Carm?"</p>

<p>"Ecstatic," Carmen responded.  "Positively."  Then before Carmen  could say anything else, Lily ushered her out the door and Brooke and  Sam were left alone in their room once again.</p>

<p>The moment the door closed, Brooke dropped her head down onto Sam's  shoulder and let out a piteous moan.  "What?" Sam asked kissing her  on the side of her head.  "That wasn't fun for you?"</p>
