<!-- Telling Series \ Section 3: Harrison - Harrison Brockavich -->

<p>Jane came home later that night to find both girls on the couch, Sam curled
up protectively in Brooke's lap. They both looked like they'd been crying for a
very long time. Setting down her bag, she sat down in the chair across from them
and offered a small smile. </p>
<p>"How did dinner go?" she asked gently, already knowing the answer wasn't
good. Sam sniffed and buried herself deeper into Brooke's lap. Brooke sighed.
She looked at Jane with puffy, red rimmed eyes still filled with tears. </p>
<p>"Badly," she said simply, quietly. Sam `hurumphed'.
</p>
<p>"Catastrophic," Sam mumbled though Brooke's shirt. Jane groaned. She had a
feeling Harrison wouldn't take the news well but she had been hoping to be
wrong. </p>
<p>"Harrison freaked out, did he?" Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Major freak out, Mom. Took the whole thing personal and then accused us of
all sorts of nasty things," Brooke was gently stroking the hair away from Sam's
face as she spoke. Sam shifted so she could look at her mother. Jane was
disturbed to see how distraught her daughter looked. </p>
<p>"I think he's gonna pull an Erin Brockavich and call the Water Department to
check and make sure that no one's tampering with the water supply," she joked
lamely. </p>
<p>"Maybe once he settles down he'll find a way to accept this the same way he
has his mother," Jane offered but her words sounded hollow even to her own ears.
Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Maybe," she agreed although she obviously wasn't convinced. </p>
<p>"Probably not, Brooke. You heard him, he only accepts his mom because he has
to, she's his mom, they're bound by blood. No such bond here," Sam said
bitterly. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Sixteen years of friendship should stand for something," she countered. Sam
shook her head. </p>
<p>"But it won't," Sam answered. Jane sighed. Sam, unfortunately had a point. </p>
<p>"I prefer to think it will," Brooke said confidently.
</p>
<p>"Optimist," Sam teased, her mood lifting slightly. </p>
<p>"Pessimist," Brooke accused, kissing Sam's forehead. Sam gave her a small
smile. </p>
<p>"Realist, actually. But I guess it wouldn't kill me to hold out hope," she
acquiesced. Jane nodded with a smile. </p>
<p>"No, it wouldn't. After all, stranger things have happened. Look at the two
of you." </p>
<p>"Yeah, Sam," Brooke agreed with the first hint of a real smile since Harrison
left earlier. "Besides, the guy's got to face us each day at school. It's going
to be kind of tough to ignore the both of us all the time." Sam sat up and wiped
a hand across the face. </p>
<p>"Oh, I think he'll give it a pretty good try. Either that or move to
Antarctica," she settled into Brooke, her back against Brooke's front so they
were both facing Jane. "So, now what do we do?" Jane shrugged. </p>
<p>"Who's next on your list to tell?" Sam and Brooke looked at each other. </p>
<p>"Carmen," they said in unison. Jane smiled. </p>
<p>"Well then, that one won't be bad. It's Carmen after all. She takes
everything in stride. It'll work out. You'll see." Brooke and Sam exchanged
looks that plainly said they weren't convinced but were willing to give it a
try. After all, it couldn't get any worse than Harrison, could it? </p>
