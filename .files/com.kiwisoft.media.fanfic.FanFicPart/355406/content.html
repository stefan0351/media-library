<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Eleven -->

<p>"God, it's beautiful out here," Sam sighed staring up at the clear night sky, lit only by dozens upon dozens of sparkling stars. She was standing on the deck outside the house in just a sweater, shivering slightly in the cold night air. Brooke walked up behind her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it is," she agreed. She saw Sam shiver out of the corner of her eye. "Sam, go get a jacket. It can get really cold out here, really quick." Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," she said with a smile. "Thanks for the concern, though." Brooke walked closer and wrapped her arms around Sam from behind.</p>
<p>"This OK?" she asked carefully. Sam snickered.</p>
<p>"Gonna keep me warm yourself, huh?" she joked even as her heart fluttered.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh God, I wish&gt; she lamented. Brooke set her chin on Sam's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Heh, you wish," she whispered into Sam's ear. Sam shivered again, and this time not from the cold.</p>
<p>"What did I tell you about teasing?" she warned with a chuckle.</p>
<p>"And what if I can take what I dish out? Huh? What then?" Brooke asked with a definite taunt and promise in her tone. Sam turned around in her arms, a questioning look on her face.</p>
<p>"Brooke," she started, lowering her gaze from the surprisingly open and intense hazel stare she'd encountered. She could have almost sworn she saw something in Brooke's gaze that she daren't hope was really there. If she were forced to name it, Sam would have almost called it love. But she couldn't let herself think that way. She didn't want to feel the pain of knowing Brooke was only teasing and didn't feel the same way she did.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sam?" Brooke prompted when Sam was quiet for a few minutes. That look of pain had flashed across those brown eyes again and Brooke hated seeing it. But she couldn't understand what was causing it.</p>
<p>&lt;Maybe being here is turning out to be a painful reminder of her father's death&gt; Brooke wondered. &lt;God, I hope I haven't hurt her like that&gt;</p>
<p>"Brooke, I'm really enjoying being here, being here with you," Sam began again. Brooke grinned widely at hearing that. </p>
<p>"That's a good thing, Sam," she joked. Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"I know. And I'm loving this 'thing' that's going on between us. It's fun. I feel so comfortable with you and I wouldn't trade that for anything. But you know some of the things we've both said can be interpreted in a rather...lewd context. And well, you know that my sexual preference is for girls..." she bit her lip and sighed again.</p>
<p>"Keep going, Sam, I'm listening," Brooke said when she saw Sam was becoming uncomfortable. Her arms were still wrapped tightly around Sam's waist, giving Sam silent support.</p>
<p>"Well, I just...I'm worried that I'll say or do the wrong thing and offend you or something. And I really don't want to do that."</p>
<p>"Sam, there's nothing you can do or say that's going to upset or offend me. I swear," Brooke promised lifting Sam's chin with her finger so that their eyes met again. "Don't worry about that. I told you that I was OK with you being gay and I meant it. I trust you, Sam. And part of that trust includes being able to say the things that we say."</p>
<p>"So you understand what I was trying to say?" Sam asked with a lopsided smile. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh good. For a second there I was afraid I wasn't making any sense," Sam said with a giggle.</p>
<p>"Sam, you rarely make sense," Brooke teased her. Sam mock glared at her and stuck out her tongue. "Hey, now...unless you intend to use that thing..."</p>
<p>"BROOKE!" Sam blushed. </p>
<p>"Hey, you walked RIGHT into that one," Brooke laughed. Sam put her forehead on Brooke's shoulder for a second as she laughed too.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're right," Sam said as she secretly inhaled Brooke's scent. In the crisp mountain air, Brooke smelled heavenly to her. A few minutes later, she pulled away and sneezed.</p>
<p>"Let's go inside, Sam," Brooke suggested as the chill began to seep into her bones. "Before you catch something and spend the entire vacation with a runny nose."</p>
<p>"Oh, inviting me in? Is that an offer, Ms McQueen?" Sam joked, getting right back into the game. Brooke smirked at her.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't YOU like to know?"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"First that blonde BITCH takes my girl on a ski vacation, then my flight gets delayed, now you tell me that you're out of honey roasted peanuts?" Nicole raved angrily. "What kind of crappy airline is this?"</p>
<p>"Miss, if you just calm down..." the stewardess tried to pacify the irate blonde.</p>
<p>"Calm down? CALM DOWN? Let me tell you a thing or two, Missy!" Nicole screamed as the other first class passengers rolled their eyes almost as one entity.</p>
<p>"Nic, simmah down now," Mary Cherry requested, wanting to avoid a scene on the plane. She was having vivid images of herself and Nicole on the eleven o'clock news being hauled off to jail for causing a disturbance on a flight. </p>
<p>&lt;Ah'm too young an' perty ta be a jailhouse whore&gt; she fretted.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, shut up," Nicole hissed. Mary Cherry shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, yer makin' an ass o' yerself. Now sit down an' shut up!" Nicole blinked at her in surprise.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" she said incredulously.</p>
<p>"You heard me. We'll be in Telluride soon enough. Sit down and calm down 'fore ya get us arrested, 'kay? Save yer anger and vitriol fer Brookie. Lord knows what she's doin' to yer Spammy..." Nicole's face turned red. She then sighed and closed her eyes. The stewardess took advantage of the opportunity to escape quietly to the back.</p>
<p>"Why do you insist on reminding me of that?" she asked, her voice taking on a somewhat hurt tone that surprised Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Keep tha' in mind is awl Ah'm sayin', Nic. Yer letting yer anger and jealousy er whatever get in yer way. Yer comin' across as more than an upset girlfriend. Yer comin' across as a jealous lover," Mary Cherry pointed out.</p>
<p>"I am," Nicole bit out. Mary Cherry frowned.</p>
<p>"But Ah thought you didn' care fer Spammy as anythin' more than a tool."</p>
<p>"I don't."</p>
<p>"Ah'm confused," Mary Cherry complained. Nicole opened her eyes and glared at the Southerner.</p>
<p>"Good, that makes two of us."</p>
