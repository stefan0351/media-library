<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 6 -->

<p>Alyssa was rudely awaken to the sound of two short, but very loud, blasts of the ship horn and sat up quickly. Instantly regretting this action, she fell backwards on to the bed with a thud. "Oh....My....God!" she moaned.</p>
		<p>"Good morning Ms. Party Animal!" Kelsey's voice sang out wryly. "And how are we feeling today."</p>
		<p>"Just shoot me now!" Alyssa's voice was a thick plea from beneath the pillow she had pulled over her face to block the world. Her head was playing a tune that only her stomach seemed to understand and she wished they would both just be quiet this morning.</p>
		<p>Kelsey leaned down and lifted the pillow slightly watching Alyssa's eyelids clench tighter as the sunlight hit them. "Unh-uh, that nice little horn you just heard was the warning that the passengers will be boarding in an hour. You have approximately 30 minutes to get to your duty station. So, I 'd get hopping into the shower if I were you." Kelsey let the pillow unceremoniously drop back down and turned to tie her shoelace. Alyssa had a clear view of a long tanned leg attached to the foot that rested on the other bed. Following the long leg upward, she noticed that her roommate was dressed in what must be her working uniform of navy shorts and a white polo shirt with the cruise line emblem on it. </p>
		<p>Alyssa moaned more at where her mind seemed to be wandering than at the banging that was going on in her head. Slowly she sat up contemplating her distress. Kelsey pick up her agenda and notebook and turned toward the noise, she wondered if maybe the woman wasn't going to be able to handle the after effects of last night afterall.</p>
		<p>"Are you going to be okay?"</p>
		<p>"Just ducky! I think I need a cold shower!" Alyssa replied trying to smile to offset the sharpness of her words. Her stomach was doing a fast dance in time to the pounding in her head and the flush that accompanied her new thoughts was not helping the situation.</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't take a cold one...unless you love shocking your system to death. I usually reserve that pleasure for the coffee they serve in the ODR." Kelsey chuckled and turned toward the door to leave. Alyssa would be okay, definitely hurting, but the wiser for her misery.</p>
		<p>Alyssa sat on the edge of the bed with her head bowed wishing Kelsey would hurry up and leave so that she could be sick with a modicum of dignity, but if the woman didn't hurry, this was not going to be the case.</p>
		<p>"Good luck today!" Kelsey called out as she opened the door and closed it softly. Chuckling at the sight of her roommate, she made her way down the hall toward the Officer's Dining Room.</p>
		<p>The door slammed loudly and Alyssa was up and running to the bathroom to make good on her prediction. <i>'Oh, God and they call this fun! I think I can do without all this excitement in my life!'</i> After a few minutes of rest, she rose to her feet shaky and she turned the water on and stripped for her shower. Alyssa let the warm water run down her body until she felt reasonable human and finished her shower. Dressed and ready for duty, she looked in the mirror and marveled at how the uniform made her look more mature and confident. <i>'Amazing what a uniform will do for your morale!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa spent the majority of the morning working alongside the Chief Purser until it was time for the Passenger Orientation in the Lido Lounge. She sat with her group to the side of the stage and noticed Kelsey sitting on the other side of the podium talking with a striking blonde. She briefly wondered who the woman was, but was soon distracted by the audience that filled the room. The passengers were excited and impatiently waiting to get this mandatory orientation over so that they could start their vacations. There were only two mandatory meetings for the passengers, this one and the lifeboat drill, which would happen later that day. The room soon hushed as the Cruise Director took the stage and introduced himself. He did his usual welcoming bit and then began introducing his staff. As the introductions went along, Alyssa soon found out that the striking blonde was the Sports Director and also Kelsey's boss. The woman spoke briefly before introducing Kelsey. As the tall raven-haired woman took the stage, Alyssa noted how beautiful she actually was as applause and whistling from the audience followed her introduction. She was obviously a favorite with the passengers, many of whom seemed to know her. She waved to a couple of them and took over the microphone, describing the activities available and telling a few anecdotes that had the audience relaxed and enjoying themselves. The woman was obviously was suited for her job and Alyssa was amazed at how personable her roommate could be thinking, <i>"yeah, too bad she wasn't more personable to me!'</i></p>
		<p>When it came time for her own introduction, Alyssa just stood and smiled at the audience until she heard a loud wolf-whistle from the back of the room. Embarrassed, she looked to the back and saw Karen standing behind the bar smiling innocently. She looked down at feet as she felt the heat rise up her face and looked back up to find two very blue and very serious eyes staring at her from across the room. Not liking the feeling she was getting from the look, she returned her focus on the floor for the remainder of the orientation and fretted. <i>'What did I do?</i> <i>Why did I get that look? I didn't ask Karen to do that! Damn, what's her problem anyway?'</i></p>
		<p>The Orientation was finally complete and Alyssa went back to her duties. She didn't finish until almost 11 PM and gratefully made her way back to the cabin. She hadn't even wanted to think about eating anything but aspirin the entire day. Feeling nauseous and closed in, she felt the need to get some air and took a walk around the deck, but found herself continually stopped by passengers asking if she could help them cash travelers checks at that late hour. Finally, tired of saying no and apologizing, she headed out to the top deck up to the bow of the ship where the winds were the strongest. It was quiet up here as most of the passengers preferred the gentle winds from the sheltered lower decks, but Alyssa like the way the rough breeze whipped her hair back and smelled strongly of the sea. She went as far forward as she could and leaned against the rail looking up at the multitude of stars in the sky. She could hear the slap of water as the ship parted the seas before them. She looked down over the rail to watch as the bow cleanly sliced through the dark waters. For no particular reason she began to think of her mother and felt a bit homesick. She missed being able to tell her mother about all that had been going on and what she was doing. She didn't really miss her brothers or father in the slightest because they represented the oppression that she was trying to escape. Her mother was different. She had always been the one to praise and encourage her in whatever endeavor she chose. Alyssa also know that it was due to her mother's efforts that she had been allowed to do some of the things she had, like college and taking this job. Her father would have rather she just settle down and get married or continuing working at the library, but Alyssa had wanted so much more out of life. </p>
		<p>"You aren't going to jump already are you?" Alyssa started when she heard the deep voice behind her until she recognized its familiarity and turned to see Kelsey sitting in a deck chair in the shadow of a smokestack.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone was up here. I hope I didn't disturb you." Alyssa hesitated moving as the woman stood and began approaching her. She wasn't sure what personality she would encounter this evening. The woman was so confusing, one moment she was helpful and the next angry with her for some unknown reason. She'd be darn if she could ever figure her out.</p>
		<p>"No, I don't own the space, I just come up here to enjoy the view." Kelsey instantly wished she hadn't been so flippant with that remark but, it was said and, she couldn't take it back. Alyssa fell silent unsure of how to respond to the woman and just kept looking out over the star filled night.</p>
		<p>"See that? That's the North Star, it's the brightest one so sailors use it to navigate by." Kelsey wasn't sure why she was giving the blonde an astrology lesson, but just felt the need to slow down and break the ice.</p>
		<p>"Then what about that one, it's just as bright?" Alyssa pointed to another light in the sky and heard a soft chuckle from next to her.</p>
		<p>"That's a plane. If you watch it long enough, you will see that it moves."</p>
		<p>Alyssa strained to watch it and sure enough, it moved. "Wow! I never realized you could see planes way out here."</p>
		<p>'You'd be surprised what you can see on a clear night." </p>
		<p>The two women fell silent again, Alyssa trying to think of something to say that didn't sound stupid and Kelsey debating how she should approach the issue of Karen and her little buddies. Finally, Kelsey just took the bull by the horns and started talking frankly.</p>
		<p>"I need to tell you something and as your senior officer, its kind of my job to do it. This is your first cruise and well, things aren't always the way they seem. We are all thrown together for a long time, in close quarters, and it's easy to misconstrue feelings and friendships. I think you need to be careful with the people you associate with on the ship. They aren't always what they appear to be." Kelsey tried to explain things without really mentioning any names and realized that it wasn't coming out the way she had intended.</p>
		<p>Alyssa almost thought that Kelsey had known some of her thoughts earlier that morning, but soon realized she was talking about Karen. At first she felt shunned when she thought Kelsey was talking about her and then when she realized that wasn't the case, she felt the familiar walls of constraint and recrimination that she would get from her family and it rubbed her the wrong way. These all added up to her taking offense to everything and answered her roommate a little too hastily and harshly. "If you mean earlier today, I had no control over that situation. As for my friends and the other night, it wasn't their fault that I didn't watch how much I was drinking. I think I'm old enough to take care of myself right now and I take full responsibility for what happened. Does being senior officer give you the right to tell me who can and can't be my friends?" Alyssa bit her tongue on the last barb and couldn't believe she had actually said it. But, when she let her fear and anger, take control of her brain and it had always spelled disaster for her and this time was no exception.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's eyes narrowed at the backlash she was receiving after trying to help Alyssa. "As your senior officer it is my duty to help you become adjusted to life aboard this ship and to show you the ropes. I have neither the time, nor desire to play nursemaid to anyone. And just for the record, it is frowned upon for junior officers to socialize with crewmembers during duty hours. What you do on your own time or between cruises is no concern of mine. As far as I'm concerned this conversation is over and my job where you are concerned is done. You are on your own, I hope you enjoy the company!" Kelsey let everything go and even said more than she had realized she was thinking. Taking a step back she almost apologized, but instead, turned on her heals and walked away.</p>
		<p>Alyssa stood stunned watching the tall woman walk away from her. She wasn't sure where that all came from, but she knew that most of it she deserved. The last barb had hit home and it made her feel more alone than she had felt in a long while. She stood looking out over the rail for a long while contemplating what to do and kicking herself for being such a jerk. Now, she had a roommate who hated her. <i>'Why didn't she just keep her mouth shut and let things go!</i>' Because she was tired of always giving in and letting everyone else have control. She needed to make a stand, but she didn't need to stand on top of the person trying to help her. Shaking her head sadly, she made her way to the cabin and was relieved, but secretly disappointed, to find Kelsey had not returned to the cabin. Tired, she stripped and climbed into bed falling instantly to sleep. She slept so deeply that she didn't hear Kelsey come in an hour later. Kelsey had purposely gone to her office and stewed over the events of the evening. She could have handled the situation better, but somehow, the blonde's rebuff had hurt and she had reacted emotionally instead of using her head. But if Alyssa didn't want her help then, Kelsey wouldn't bother her anymore. Slipping into bed she tossed and turned until dawn and finally gave up and took a shower. She was dressed and walking into the Officer's Dining Room as Alyssa's alarm sounded.</p>
