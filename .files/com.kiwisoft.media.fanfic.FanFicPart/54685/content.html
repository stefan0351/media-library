<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Three: It’s only six days -->

<P>B’Elanna stared at Janeway as if she had grown a second and third head.</P>
<P>"Me and Seven?" B’Elanna turned at let her eyes wander over the tight
confines of the cell she had come to call home. "No thank you, Ma’am. I think
I’ll stay right where I am." B’Elanna walked back to her bunk and flopped onto
her back and stared up at the ceiling.</P>
<P>"You don’t have that option," Janeway said. She was beginning to get more
satisfaction from her present plot than she really should, but with all the
trouble Torres and Seven had been giving her lately, she intended to milk it for
all it was worth.</P>
<P>Torres sat up and turned toward Janeway. "You can’t be serious, Captain. I’ve
just served three weeks for busting up Tuvok’s security squad. You send me off
for six days with that…that… with ‘her,’ and I’ll end up court martialed."</P>
<P>Janeway gave Torres an evil, predatory smile. "I’m hoping you’ve learned your
lesson."</P>
<P>B’Elanna snorted and stood up. "I’m a slow learner, Ma’am." She paced the
small room, not crossing the doorway despite the fact the forcefield was now
down. </P>
<P>"You’re going. Consider it the last of your punishment."</P>
<P>"If I’d known this was part of the punishment, I never would have lost my
temper," B’Elanna said as she ran her hands through her dark hair.</P>
<P>Janeway laughed. "Well, just remember that over the next six days. If either
of you returns with so much as a broken fingernail, I’ll lock you two in one of
these cells, together, for a month."</P>
<P>Torres released a sigh and her shoulders slumped in defeat. "Do I at least
get time to go pack a bag?" she asked without looking up.</P>
<P>"Make it quick. Seven’s in the shuttle bay now, and she hates tardiness,"
Janeway said, unable to avoid tossing out one last dig.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna stood outside the shuttle bay for several minutes before actually
entering. She nodded to passing crewmembers who seemed surprised to see her out
of the brig. Once she had her temper firmly in check she entered and went to the
<I>Delta Flyer</I>. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, you are late," Seven said instead of a greeting.</P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, considering I just got drafted for this little mission, you’re
lucky I’m here at all." Torres brushed past her traveling companion and went
inside the shuttle directly to the small sleeping area in the back and tossed
her duffel bag onto one of the bunks.</P>
<P>Seven stood in the doorway behind the compact Klingon-human hybrid and
crossed her arms over her chest. "Your tardiness was intentional," Seven
accused. "I inquired as to your location and was informed that you were waiting
at the entrance to the shuttle bay for the last six minutes. Explain."</P>
<P>B’Elanna spun and glared at Seven, who didn’t react. "Just be glad I did.
I’ve been standing out there going over every reason I could think of to not
ring your scrawny neck."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven smirked, and tilted her head to one side. "And the reasons
were so abundant that it took you six minutes to list them?"</P>
<P>"Don’t start with me, Borg." Torres squeezed around Seven and went out to the
shuttle’s helm. "It took me that long to come up with one reason."</P>
<P>Seven followed on B’Elanna’s heels. "And what was the reason?"</P>
<P>"I didn’t want to get my hands dirty." Torres flopped into one of the chairs
and began the preflight checklist.</P>
<P>Seven sat in the chair to B’Elanna’s right and began assisting her. "I assure
you, I have impeccable hygiene."</P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, you’re still a Borg. The idea of touching a drone doesn’t appeal
to me," B’Elanna shot back. She was surprised when she saw Seven actually
flinch.</P>
<P>"I am no longer a drone," Seven said quietly. "Perhaps we should agree to
keep our conversation to a minimum."</P>
<P>"Fine by me," Torres said as she finished her preflight check.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Twenty four hours later, Seven of Nine was in the cargo hold double checking
the containment field that was supposed to transport the dilithium crystals. She
avoided Lieutenant Torres for the most part, only needing to actual speak with
her on one occasion to point out a necessary course adjustment. The former Borg
drone was used to people avoiding her, and she occupied her mind with
calculations to increase the sensitivity of the shuttle’s sensors. </P>
<P>It was not as easy for B’Elanna to remain completely quiet. During the three
weeks Torres had spent in the brig she had been able to talk with her guards and
keep up on ship’s gossip. The complete silence of the shuttle quickly began to
grate on her nerves. She decided she was desperate enough to talk to the
drone.</P>
<P>"Hey, Seven, what are you doing?" Torres asked as she leaned against the
shuttle wall.</P>
<P>Seven raised her blonde eyebrow in response.</P>
<P>"Okay, I admit it. I was a little tough on you yesterday." It was as close to
an apology as Torres would get. She ran her hand though her hair and cleared her
throat. "So, what are you doing?"</P>
<P>Seven accepted the gesture for what it was. People often said that she was
like a child in many ways, and one of those ways was in her willingness to move
beyond disagreements. </P>
<P>"I have fine-tuned the sensor array to increase its sensitivity by 32
percent." Seven stood up so B’Elanna could access the panel.</P>
<P>"Yeah?" Torres knelt down and examined the changes. "You rerouted the
auxiliary power feed to the imaging matrix. Good idea."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said cautiously.</P>
<P>Torres turned and looked up at the athletic blonde. "You know, Seven, I can
recognize good work."</P>
<P>"I am aware of that fact, Lieutenant. You are a brilliant engineer. Part of
that entails the ability to notice the skill others possess." Seven linked her
hands behind her back, forcing her chest into stark profile as she turned toward
the front of the shuttle.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Seven." B’Elanna stood and looked at her companion. B’Elanna had
noticed Seven’s perfect body on many occasions, and what amazed the half Klingon
most was that the exdrone seemed oblivious to her own beauty.</P>
<P>"I merely stated the obvious," Seven explained.</P>
<P>"Brilliant? Wow." Torres motioned to a panel cover lying on the floor behind
Seven. "So are you finished in here?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven handed Torres the panel and then extended her hand and pulled
her to feet.</P>
<P>A beeping from the helm cut off their first civil conversation. They both
moved to the helm and sat, B’Elanna quickly accessing the readings. "Well,
Seven, looks like your improved sensors are picking something up."</P>
<P>Seven leaned over against B’Elanna and gave the computer a few quick
commands, her fingers moving gracefully over the controls. "I am
detecting…neutrinos. They appear to be from a stabile source," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Stabile?" Torres stood and leaned against Seven’s shoulder to get a better
look at her readings. "Could that be a wormhole?"</P>
<P>"Possibly," Seven said, trying to ignore the warmth of B’Elanna’s body
against her arm. "These readings are similar to the data I have received from
<I>Voyager’s</I> records on the Bajorian wormhole. The stabile neutrinos have
only been found at that artificial wormhole."</P>
<P>"So you think it’s the same wormhole?" B’Elanna’s eyes widened.</P>
<P>"No," Seven stated. "Only that both anomalies share stabile neutrinos."</P>
<P>"Damn. Well, I say we go investigate and see just where this wormhole leads.
It could be just the short cut we’re looking for."</P>
<P>"It could also lead us directly back into the heart of Borg space," Seven
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Always the optimist," Torres whispered under her breath as she changed
course toward the neutrino emissions.</P>
<P>"The captain did not give us permission to investigate any…phenomena," Seven
said even as she adjusted the sensors to scan the area in question.</P>
<P>"I’m not passing up a possible wormhole back to the Alpha Quadrant. Janeway
should be glad we found it. I still can’t believe she stuck me on this stupid
mission," Torres grumbled. "Like it really takes a Chief Engineer to pick up
some dilithium deposits."</P>
<P>Seven glanced over at her companion and waited a few minutes before
commenting. "I believe it is my fault you were assigned to this mission."</P>
<P>"What?" Torres said as she spun toward Seven and glared at her.</P>
<P>"I wanted to participate in this mission. Given our well known
incompatibility, I believe she sent you to either dissuade me from coming or to
punish me." Seven sighed and gave the control panel her full attention.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stared at the exdrone trying to decide if she should be angry or
laugh. It hadn’t occurred to her that Seven was so keenly aware of human nature.
Finally, her own curiosity made her break the silence.</P>
<P>"Umm, Seven? What did you do to piss off the captain?"</P>
<P>"Tom Paris is an idiot," Seven said instead of answering Torres’
question.</P>
<P>"Yes, he is, but that wasn’t what I asked."</P>
<P>Seven turned to B’Elanna and took a leisurely look at the Klingon’s muscular
frame. "You are the second most attractive female on board <I>Voyager</I> as
well as one of the most intelligent, and yet he choose to jeopardize everything
you offer by… copulating with that hologram."</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt her cheeks darken and her face became warm and she cleared her
throat. "Uh, thanks," she said unsteadily, then frowned when she realized
Seven’s implication. "Second most attractive? You really are full of yourself,
Borg."</P>
<P>Seven seemed confused. "Who else would I be full of?"</P>
<P>"I suppose you think you’re the smartest and best looking?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven said honestly. "I do not. I believe of all the women on
<I>Voyager</I>… I am the least appealing. As you are so fond of pointing out, I
am Borg."</P>
<P>"So who <I>is</I> the most attractive?" B’Elanna stared at the blonde, unable
to grasp that she didn’t know she was one of the most beautiful women many had
ever seen anywhere.</P>
<P>Seven blushed and looked away. "It is irrelevant."</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said, drawing the word out. "So what did you do to warrant
the punishment of six days with me?"</P>
<P>Seven turned slowly back toward B’Elanna. "I killed a hologram, and then
pointed out to the captain that it was no different than her use of the
programs."</P>
<P>"Who’d you kill? Her bartender?" Torres said jokingly.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Oh. Well, what else did you say to her?" Torres asked.</P>
<P>"That it shouldn’t matter if member of the crew used them for killing or
fucking. Both are methods of relieving stress."</P>
<P>B’Elanna burst into a howling laugh, letting her Klingon self fully enjoy the
moment. Finally, she wiped her eyes and looked at Seven who seemed mildly amused
herself. "You really said, ‘fucking’?"</P>
<P>"It is the correct term. It means a sexual act of a vulgar or unseemly
nature. I can think of nothing more unseemly than sex with a hologram," Seven
said with her typical bluntness.</P>
<P>B’Elanna studied Seven for a several moments, rubbing her chin as a
realization came into her consciousness. "The woman who is the most beautiful…
in your eyes… it’s Janeway, isn’t it?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said without looking up from the panel. "I am getting strange
reading from the area ahead. There appears to be a nebula around the wormhole.
If it is indeed a wormhole."</P>
<P>"Let’s ease into the nebula and see what we can see," Torres said. She looked
over at Seven and realized the exdrone was in love with the captain.</P>
<P>"Wait," Seven said, dropping the shuttle to one half impulse. "There are
several beacons between us and the nebula."</P>
<P>"Are they armed?" Torres asked.</P>
<P>"They do not appear to be," Seven answered.</P>
<P>"You’re in love with her, aren’t you?"</P>
<P>Seven’s hands froze on the console. "You are mistaken," Seven said, her voice
like ice. "I have no feelings for the captain."</P>
<P>"You react pretty strongly for someone who doesn’t have any feelings."</P>
<P>Seven bit her lip and then looked at B’Elanna. For some reason B’Elanna’s
recent loss at the hands of a holographic character made her feel closer to the
Klingon. "I am… no longer in love with her," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said, amazed the exdrone admitted as much as she had. "Does
she know? I mean, did she know how you used to feel?"</P>
<P>"It is irrelevant. We had developed a certain closeness. After she convinced
me to return to <I>Voyager</I> during my confusion about the conspiracies, I
thought we understood each other." Seven looked away, embarrassed by both the
admission and the reference to her brief delusion about the crew of
<I>Voyager</I> after she overloaded her cortical implant by using Borg
technology to download all of the ship’s logs. "The person I thought she was
would not ‘fall in love’ with a hologram."</P>
<P>"I’m sorry," B’Elanna said sincerely. She was suddenly glad to be on the
shuttle with Seven. For the first time she thought she understood the exdrone,
and she was finding out she was very much like Torres herself.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said, and then went back to the control panel. "There is a
communications relay on the beacon. It is activating."</P>
<P>"Got it," Torres said. "Audio only. I’m opening channels now."</P><I>
<P>*"Alien vessel, you are entering a restricted zone. Leave now or you will be
prosecuted for violation of the Dengari Border."*</P></I>
<P>"Friendly aren’t they," B’Elanna said. "The same message is on a continual
loop."</P>
<P>"We should return to our original flight plan," Seven said as she began
plotting a return course.</P>
<P>"The hell we will. There might be a wormhole in there. We aren’t just gonna’
turn tail and run. There’s no sign of any ships in the area." Torres began
plotting her own course into the nebula.</P>
<P>"That would be ill-advised. The message was clear, and we have no reason to
violate their border." Seven reset the course heading.</P>
<P>"Yes, we do," Torres put her hand over Seven’s and held it in place as she
used her other hand to lay in a course to the nebula. "I think I saw some debris
in there. Could be a damaged ship… we have to look for survivors."</P>
<P>"I doubt the veracity of your claim, and I doubt the Dengari will find it a
plausible excuse either." Seven pulled her hand free.</P>
<P>"Come on, Seven. Where’s your sense of adventure?"</P>
<P>"Borg have no sense of adventure," Seven deadpanned. </P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, baring her razor sharp canines. "But you’re not Borg
anymore, now are you?"</P>
<P>"I hope I do not find myself wishing I were," Seven said as she leaned back
into her chair so that Torres could take control of the helm.</P>
