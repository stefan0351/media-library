<!-- Perfect Together \ null -->

<p>Brooke McQueen walked into the Novak at Kennedy High
School, crashing down on the seat. She sighed sadly,
as Nicole and Mary Cherry walked in.</p>

<p>"Ok, B, spill, what is eating you alive," Nicole
asked.</p>
<p>"I am just down, ok."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well you've been down ever since little
McPherson split from the Palace. So what gives?"</p>
<p>"Can't I miss her?"</p>
<p>"What is there to miss? Her slandering newspaper
articles? Her ever present smugness? I mean, does she
even have a good side about her? I've never seen her
have any kindness for any one."</p>
<p>"That is because you shred her to pieces no matter
what she does, Nic."</p>

<p>Nicole stared at Brooke. Mary Cherry decided to stay
out of the conversation.</p>

<p>"What are you saying Brooke? That Spam is actually a
good person?"</p>
<p>"More then you would ever know, Nicole. She is a very
caring person. Her and I were getting close, really
close. Why she left? I really wish I had the answer to
that. So Nicole, just back off for once, if you ever
my friend, back off, please."</p>
<p>"All right, B, I'll back off. For now at least."</p>

<p>Nicole walked out, with Mary Cherry in tow. Brooke
sighed, putting her head in her hands. She knew why
Sam had left. They were sleeping together in Brooke's
room, when Mike barged into the room, scaring the shit
out of both Sam and Brooke. Mike stood there in shock,
while Sam scrambled to get her clothes. Before Mike
could ever ask a question, or yell for that matter,
Sam ran out of the room, locking and barricading
herself in her own room.</p>

<p>Brooke stared at her father, not knowing what to say.
She was covered with her sheets, holding her head
down. Jane quickly ran to see what all the commotion
was about, and saw Brooke in her own bed, naked. </p>

<p>"Mike? What's going on," Jane asked.</p>
<p>"It appears our daughters have been sleeping
together."</p>
<p>"What? Brooke is this true?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But it's not just about sex. It's love, a deep
love."</p>
<p>"You are too young to know what sex is, young lady,"
Mike said loudly, "And I will not have you sleeping
with Sam McPherson, that would mean you're a lesbian."</p>
<p>"And so what if I am? It's my choice dad. So is who I
love."</p>
<p>"Not under my roof young lady. And as for Sam, I
honestly don't know what to do about her. She probably
seduced you to get revenge for me wanting to marry
Jane."</p>
<p>"Now wait just a minute," Jane started, "I don't think
we should blame neither girl. Mike come on, we'll talk
about this later, ok honey? Why don't we let the dust
settle ok? We are all in shock at the moment, and I
think Sam is even more scared than you are, so come
on."</p>

<p>Jane pulled Mike out of Brooke's room, allowing the
girl to give a sigh of relief. She got dressed and
walked to Sam's room, knocking gently.</p>

<p>"Sam, sweetie? Its Brooke, let me in, ok?"</p>

<p>Brooke could hear Sam unlock the door and open it
slowly. Brooke walked in, and the brunette wrapped her
arms around her tightly, crying.</p>

<p>"Oh Brooke, I am so sorry that I ran. Just seeing
Mike's face, I thought he was going to kill me."</p>
<p>"Shhh, it's ok now. I'm here, I have you."</p>
<p>"Brooke, I can't let this destroy you. I care about
you too much to let us destroy you."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, 'destroy me?'"</p>
<p>"Nicole will use this to her advantage to try and
bring you down. I can't let that happen to you."</p>
<p>"Sam, over these past few weeks, it's been me worrying
about my popularity. You made me realize that I don't
need to be popular. As long as I have a few good
friends, like Carmen, Lily and Harrison, I am going to
be all right. I'll be even better if I have you. Let
me worry about my popularity, and just be here for me,
loving me like you have been. Why else are you upset?"</p>
<p>"I never intended on your father finding us in bed
together and me running out naked."</p>
<p>"That was kind of funny. I've never seen you move so
fast outside of bed."</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, Brooke."</p>
<p>"But I never meant for either of them to see that."</p>
<p>"Mom knows?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I am so dead."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I never keep secrets from her. And this was a
big secret Brooke."</p>
<p>"She stood up for you, when dad wanted to blame you.
She stood up for the both of us."</p>
<p>"Well, maybe we should go down stairs and talk to
them."</p>
<p>"Yeah, sounds like a good idea."</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke walked hand in hand down stairs to the
kitchen and sat facing their parents. Mike looked
right at Sam, daggers in his eyes.</p>

<p>"So, how long has this been going on," Mike asked.</p>
<p>"Our one month anniversary is this Friday," Brooke
answered.</p>
<p>"A month? So how long have you had these feelings?"</p>
<p>"I have always been attracted to girls, I told mom I
was bi, well because she caught me ogling a Victoria's
Secret catalog. But I actually fell in love with
Brooke the more I got to know her, so basically ever
since we've moved in together," Sam said.</p>
<p>"How about you Brooke?"</p>
<p>"I've always had this hidden attraction to Sam. That
is why we fought so much. It was a lot of frustration
on both parts, wanting to tell, but not wanting to
tell because we were afraid of rejection."</p>
<p>"When did you come to realize you felt the same way
towards each other," Jane asked.</p>
<p>"Well, Sam was having a nightmare when the two of you
were out of town and she was screaming and crying. I
awoke immediately and ran into her room. She was
curled up at the end of her bed; she was shaking and
crying. I went over to comfort her, and as soon as I
did, she leapt into my arms, holding me very tightly.
She kept repeating that she couldn't lose me, that she
loved me with all her heart and soul. I stayed with
her until the next morning. She slept so soundly in my
arms, and the next morning I confessed my love for
her."</p>
<p>"So Sam did initiate all of this," Mike growled.</p>

<p>Sam shrunk in fear, clutching onto Brooke. She never
really feared Mike, but seeing his eyes this morning,
she now had reason.</p>

<p>"Dad, stop that. She is scared enough as it is. You
scared the living hell out of both of us this
morning."</p>
<p>"Well I never expected to see you and this harlot in
bed together!"</p>
<p>"Mike," Jane exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Jane, you heard Brooke herself, Sam was the first to
confess. Brooke felt pressured to tell her how she
felt. I don't want that in my house."</p>
<p>"Fine, Mr. McQueen, I'll leave," Sam spoke meekly.</p>

<p>For the first time, Brooke saw a side of Sam that no
one saw, the scared and innocent side. Sam stood up
and headed up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Dad? Are you just going to let her leave?"</p>
<p>"She said she would."</p>
<p>"If she does, then so do I."</p>
<p>"You take one step outside of this house and I will
have you hunted down by the National Guard if need be.
You are not permitted to see Sam McPherson ever again.
Do I make myself clear young lady?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dad."</p>

<p>Jane got up and ran after Sam. Brooke didn't know what
was said, only the last thing Sam said to her. Brooke
ran to the door and tried to stop her, pleading,
crying for her to stay.</p>

<p>"Brooke McQueen, the queen of my heart, I need to do
this. I will always love you, no matter what he said.
You are my heart and soul. Mom will know how to get
hold of me. I'll be back, I promise. Just don't hurt
yourself, please, I need you whole for when I get
home."</p>
<p>"Take me with you!"</p>
<p>"I wish I could, but I know what it is like to lose a
father, and I don't want you to lose yours. He loves
you, in his way. He'll come around when he sees how
bad things are without me here. Live for me ok, love?
I'll only be a phone call away."</p>

<p>Sam held onto Brooke tightly, kissing her tears away.
"Don't weep, I will come home, I promise."</p>
<p>"Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me."</p>
<p>"It's the only option. You leave and Mike would have
the US Army, Navy, Marines, Airforce and any other
military operation looking for you. This hurts me just
as it hurts you, but I swear on my life that I will
return home to you, because without you Brooke, I am
incomplete."</p>

<p>She kissed Brooke deeply and hugged her again. She let
go of Brooke and looked at her mom.</p>

<p>"Take care of her for me, and let her call me whenever
she needs to. I love you mom."</p>
<p>"I love you too, Sam," Jane said, walking to Sam.</p>

<p>Sam hugged her mother and kissed her cheek. She looked
one last time at Brooke.</p>

<p>"I will always love you."</p>
<p>"I love you too."</p>

<p>Sam kissed Brooke one last time and then turned,
grabbing her bag. Brooke tried to stop her, but Jane
held Brooke. Sam walked out the door and it shut,
leaving Brooke collapsing in Jane's arms sobbing. The
last she heard was Sam speeding away in her car. It
had been a week now, and they had talked every night.
Sam was in LA now, with some friends of hers.</p>

<p>Brooke got up from the seat and headed to lunch. On
her way there, Carmen and Lily stopped her, two people
who accidentally stumbled on her and Sam's
relationship. Also they were very supportive.</p>

<p>"Hey Brooke, how are you holding up," Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"I miss her so much you guys. I just want her to come
home, but dad is still pissed off. Jane is really
tempted to leave him."</p>
<p>"Because of his attitude towards Sam," Lily asked.</p>
<p>"Not only that, but he treats me like I am diseased.
He can't except the fact that his little girl is gay."</p>
<p>"Well, just so you know, Sam called me and wanted me
to tell you not to worry, that you are still the queen
of her heart," Carmen added.</p>
<p>"Thanks Carm, I needed to hear that."</p>

<p>Carmen hugged Brooke, helping her in any way she
could.</p>

<p>"Sam can be stubborn sometimes, and for the most part
she knows what she is doing. She is making your dad
see that having her out of your lives will ultimately
destroy the family he is trying to create. I feel bad
because both you and Jane are casualties of war, but
give Sam some credit, her hearts in the right place,"
Carmen said.</p>
<p>"Carmen's right, Sam always knows what she is doing.
Besides, this is tearing her apart as much as it is
you. I know the two of you talk each night, but she
calls me crying how much she misses you and loves you.
She'll be back soon; her heart can't take this for
much longer. She'll probably come back sooner than we
all think."</p>
<p>"You mean like right now," Sam said as she walked up
to the three girls.</p>

<p>Brooke nearly fainted when she saw Sam. She pushed
passed Carmen and Lily, leaping into Sam's arms. Sam
held onto Brooke tightly.</p>

<p>"Oh baby, I couldn't go one more day without holding
you. I love you so much, Brooke McQueen, and nothing
will ever change that."</p>
<p>"I love you too, Sammy, I always will. I am so glad
you are back. Where are you going to stay?"</p>
<p>"Well," Lily piped up, "She'll be staying with me some
days and Carmen others. The three of us talked it out
on a conference call. Happy Anniversary, Brooke, from
Carmen and me."</p>
<p>"Oh you guys."</p>
<p>"Besides, we couldn't stand hearing how miserable Sam
was, and see how bad you were any more. Also, you need
to thank Ms. McPherson too," Carmen said.</p>
<p>"Jane knew about this?"</p>
<p>"Yup, mom and I have been working things out and she
is really happy for the both of us, and well she'll
deal with Mike in her own way," Sam said.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Things have been getting pretty bad around the
house. Even Nicole is getting suspicious."</p>
<p>"Screw Nicole and the hierarchy of Kennedy High.
Brooke you are so much better than that. Yes, you are
a cheerleader, and yes you are popular, but quoting a
famous movie, Huck Finn, 'Just because an idea is
popular, doesn't make it right.' Just because
popularity gets the goods, doesn't make it right. Just
because you have a beautiful body, a great
cheerleading career, and you were home coming queen,
doesn't make people want to be your friend because of
the wonderful personality you have, or the great sense
of humor you have, or even the diversity you stand
for. They just want to be friends to help themselves
get popular. I'm sorry, Brooke, but you are worth more
than that. You are a special person that is more than
just a beauty queen, you are an individual, whom I
love very much," Sam said.</p>
<p>"I think that is one of the nicest compliments I have
ever gotten," Brooke replied, as tears streamed down
her face, "It means so much to me that you just don't
see me as a cheerleader or home coming queen."</p>
<p>"Brooke, Sam is right. Once we saw past the
shallowness that we were blinded by because of the
stereotypes of cheerleaders, we got to see the real
you and it is a good thing," Lily said.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled at her friends, and hugged Sam tightly.</p>

<p>"You guys are the greatest friends any one could ever
ask for, and you, Samantha McPherson are the best
girlfriend I could ever love."</p>
<p>"So are you, Brooke. You complete me."</p>
<p>"Oh, Sammy. That means so much to me. You mean so much
to me. You are my world, and I was so lost without
you."</p>
<p>"As I was lost with out you, but not anymore. I don't
care what Mike has to say, I love you and he is not
stopping that!"</p>
<p>"That is all I needed to hear."</p>

<p>Sam smiled kissing Brooke's nose.</p>

<p>"Ok, will the cutest couple of Kennedy High, please
stop being all cute in the hall ways before lunch gets
out," Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"Besides, Jane should be waiting for you back home,"
Lily added.</p>
<p>"Thanks again you two. You've really helped me pull
off the perfect gift," Sam said.</p>
<p>"Well we except cash, check or money order," Carmen
said with a grin.</p>
<p>"I'll figure some type of payment later, just cover
for Brooke. Tell them she felt sick because she is
having problems at home."</p>
<p>"Will do Sam. You two take care."</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke nodded, leaving Kennedy High. They got
into their separate cars and sped home. Jane McPherson
was waiting, as promised. Sam rushed through the door,
hugging her mom tightly.</p>

<p>"Oh sweetie, welcome home."</p>
<p>"Thanks Mom. I missed you so much."</p>
<p>"I missed you too."</p>
<p>"Brian and James send their love. Did you know they
were in a hand fasting ceremony?"</p>
<p>"No. I am so happy for those two. They deserve each
other, just like the two of you deserve each other."</p>
<p>"Thanks mom."</p>
<p>"Yeah, thank you, Jane. Having Sam back is the best
day of my life."</p>
<p>"Well I knew the two of you were lacking on the
honesty factor to each other, so Carmen, Lily and I
figured the best thing to do was get Sam back and let
me deal with Mike."</p>
<p>"Sounds like Mike isn't getting any nookie huh mom?"</p>
<p>"That is for me to know and you to never find out. Now
go on and get out of here before the cave man gets
home."</p>
<p>"Jane, I got let home early," Mike called from the
kitchen, "whose car is in the drive way?"</p>

<p>Sam went white and Brooke clutched onto her as Mike
walked into the living room. The moment he lay his
eyes on Sam, he nearly went ballistic.</p>

<p>"What in the hell is she doing here," Mike roared.</p>
<p>"I called for her," Jane said, "our humble home is
falling apart Mike, and it is because you are too
narrow minded to even allow your own daughter to be
with who she loves. I can't stand for that anymore. I
can't stand the fact that Brooke is crying herself to
sleep every day since Sam left. That she is a shell of
her self, and even the school is noticing. Her
friends, our friends, they are all noticing that Sam
is apart of this family and a huge influence on
Brooke's life. Now you have three choices. First you
can kick Sam out, which would result in me leaving,
second let Sam move back in but forbid them to be
alone together, which would never work or third you
can let Sam come home and see Brooke openly. I love
you Mike and I love Brooke just as much as she was my
own daughter. But Sam has admitted that this
attraction was before we moved in together, so has
Brooke. It was just a matter of time, Mike, whether we
moved in together or not. This just helped speed up
the process. We have all said our piece, now the ball
is in your court."</p>

<p>Mike stood in utter shock. For the first time in his
life he was speechless. Sam took a step towards Mike.</p>

<p>"I know you are angry, and you blame me for this, but
both us feel the same way towards the other. You can
push me away, but that will only destroy the family
you've wanted for so long. And Brooke does love my mom
like her own. I have my own issues with actually
calling you dad, but that has to do with my own
father. I'd feel like I was betraying him by calling
you dad. But I do love you like a father. But I just
want to say, that no matter what you do, I will always
love Brooke more than my own life."</p>

<p>Sam stepped back and took Brooke's hand, which Brooke
squeezed tightly.</p>

<p>"Sam is right, daddy, no matter what you do, our love
will only grow stronger. With Sam away, I was lost. I
felt completely and utterly alone, not matter what
anyone did to cheer me up. The only thing that
actually got me through the day was that I knew Sam
was going to call me later that night. She is my
savior, whether she knows it or not. Do what you want,
but I will always love her."</p>
<p>"I understand that Brooke. I just have a really hard
time accepting the fact that you and Sam are together.
Not my idea of the perfect family, but give me time,
ok," Mike said.</p>

<p>Mike then walked into the kitchen leaving the three of
them alone. Jane looked at Sam and Brooke.</p>

<p>"I'll do damage control. You two get out for awhile,
be with each other. When you get back, we'll talk."</p>
<p>"Thanks mom," Sam said.</p>

<p>Jane walked into the kitchen, while Sam and Brooke
headed outside to Sam's car. Sam opened the trunk,
pulling out a dozen red roses and a big black box with
a white bow.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry I had to leave before our anniversary.
So, I got these on the way home today, and I bought
these for you over the entire month."</p>
<p>"There is more than one present in this big box?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. You know me, shop till I drop."</p>
<p>"Yeah right."</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke sat next to Sam's car, while Brooke
looked at the box. She took the lid off to see about
six other boxes, all different sizes. She took the
biggest and opened it first. Inside was a photo album,
on the front it read: The Days of our Love, and many
more to come. Brooke opened it up and saw a lot of
early pictures of the two of them, when they were not
really close. Then there were pictures of them from
prom and the wedding, when they started to get closer.
Finally there were pictures of them as a couple.
Brooke smiled when she remembered when some of those
pictures were taken.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Brooke squeaked.
"Keep going."</p>

<p>Brooke took out the next box, which was slightly
smaller than the first. She opened it to find another
book. She quickly realized what it was. It was a
journal. She opened it up and saw that it was Sam's
journal, from the times when she was scared of losing
Brooke by other people taking her away. She wrote
about her nightmares. Then finally that night when in
the midst of a nightmare, she found Brooke holding
onto her. That night was the night she confessed her
love for Brooke. After the entries were poems written
about love and about Brooke.</p>

<p>"Wow, Sammy. Why are you giving me this?"</p>
<p>"So you know that I have always loved and will always
love you."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled, taking out the next box. She opened it
to find a collection of mixed CD's. The song they
first danced to was on it, the song that they heard on
their first date, also the song that they had made
love to, for the first time. There were other songs
that they both loved. Brooked smiled and took out the
next box. It also contained more mixed CD's.</p>

<p>"You had too much fun with someone's burner, didn't
you," Brooke asked.</p>
<p>"Well it was cheaper to download them, then buy em. So
I just burned em too. I mean can you honestly find any
of these songs on one CD? I think not."</p>

<p>Brooke grinned, taking the next box. As she opened it,
she found another journal. She opened the cover and
saw it was from the past week. She read how sad Sam
really was. She began to cry reading the entries. They
were very moving. One in particular caught her eye.</p>

<p>'Waking with out her is like waking to my execution.
Knowing that she is hurting along with me because her
father has split us apart, on my decision. I feel
absolutely horrible for deserting her. But I swear on
my own life I will return to her, one way or another.
Even if I have to take her away from her father, I
will do so. I am willing to lose all I have for her.
She is my heart. She is all I have ever needed.'</p>

<p>Brooke wiped her eyes, looking over at Sam.</p>

<p>"Did you mean that? That you are willing to lose
everything you have for me?"</p>
<p>"From the depths of my heart, I meant it."</p>

<p>Brooke leaned over and kissed Sam on the lips.
"That is the greatest present anyone could have given
me."</p>
<p>"One more Princess."</p>

<p>Sam pulled the last box, which was the smallest, from
the box. Brooke slowly opened it and found a silver
ring. Inscribed on the inside was 'S & B 4ever.'</p>
<p>Brooke was in tears as Sam took the ring and slid it
on Brooke's finger.</p>

<p>"Now no matter how far apart we are, you will always
know that we are meant to be together, no matter who
oppose us. I love you Brooke, and not even death can
stop that."</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy."</p>

<p>Sam hugged Brooke tightly as Brooke cried on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"No one, not even Satan herself, can stop the love I
have for you."</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy, that is the nicest thing anyone has said to
me. And these are the nicest things anyone has ever
done for me. How did you ever think of this?"</p>
<p>"My dad gave my mom his journal before he died, and
she showed me all of his love letters that he gave her
in a scrap book. He wanted her to remember the love
that they shared, but also to not to dwell on what
they had. To move on."</p>
<p>"I can't move on from you, not while I still have you.
You aren't going to die on me. Not until we are both
old and grey."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere without you."</p>

<p>Sam leaned over and kissed Brooke gently on the lips
then collected her body in a tremendous hug. Inside,
Jane forced Mike to watch from the window.</p>

<p>"Is that something you honestly want to destroy Mike?
The love those two have created is so strong, and
nearly un-breakable. I, for one, will not stand by and
let you destroy that. They deserve this."</p>
<p>"I know Jane. Honestly I do. I couldn't break Brooke's
heart by getting rid of Sam. She just loved her just
as much as she did if Sam was still here. I just find
it hard to believe. But then again, I am trying to
decide what to tell the relatives and friends of the
family."</p>
<p>"We'll deal with that when we come to that crossroads.
And they are included as well," Jane said, pointing at
the two girls, "They would have loved each other even
if we didn't get together."</p>
<p>"They do look cute together."</p>
<p>"That they do. Could you honestly not accept a love
like that?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, I couldn't. It would honestly kill both
girls if I did. I couldn't live with myself if that
happened."</p>
<p>"Neither could I, then again, I couldn't live with you
either."</p>

<p>Mike looked at Jane and held his head down.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad that I am not a bone head and lost
you all for good."</p>
<p>"So am I, Mike, so am I."</p>

<p>Jane kissed Mike, and they left the window. Back
outside, Brooke and Sam were still cuddled together,
next to Sam's car.</p>

<p>"Sammy, today has been one of the best days of my
life."</p>
<p>"Princess, today is the beginning of our life
together, and no one can tear us apart."</p>

<p>Sam kissed Brooke again. As they leaned together,
Brooke realized that Sam was right. No one could ever
break the love they had apart. Even if that meant
losing all she had, Brooke was never going to give up
Sam, not even popularity was important enough to give
Sam up. </p>
