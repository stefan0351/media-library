<p>Hey, all. This is a story I've been working on since around Halloween. I've been working hard on getting chapters written in the past month or so to avoid having long delays between chapters. I've seen stories similar to this popping up all over the place lately, but the inspiration for this actually came from a story of a similar nature written for another TV show - if you want to know which story, let me know and I can point you in the right direction so you can read it. It has the same idea, but then again it isn't even close to the other story... Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this.</p>

ONE</b></p>
<p>Miley Stewart opened her eyes slowly, blinking the sleep from her blue-grey eyes. Another sleepless night turned into morning, and school had beckoned her if for no other reason than to escape the room that had held so many of her… well, she wouldn't call them nightmares. No - they are strange, but they were by no means <i>bad</i> dreams.</p>
<p>"Miss Stewart."</p>
<p>It was with the sound of Mr. Corelli's soft voice that Miley remembered where she was – history class. Lifting her head from the desk, she let out a frustrated sigh and ran a hand through her hair. Her cheek stung slightly, and burned just a little as she rubbed it with her other hand. Blinking hard, her eyes were no longer fuzzy and Mr. Corelli caught her eye. He was sitting backwards in front of her desk, his elbows resting on the back of the same brown plastic chair as she was.</p>
<p>Her cheeks heating up, Miley bit her bottom lip and met his gaze. "I'm sorry, Mr. C. I didn't mean to fall asleep."</p>
<p>"It's all right, Miley." Mr. Corelli said softly. "But this is the fifth time this week… it's Friday. Now, it's the end of the day. I made a call to your last period teacher and told her I needed your help with something, but I expect you to actually stay awake next time I see you."</p>
<p>Miley looked down at her desk, lifting a hand to pick up her pencil. She dragged the eraser over the surface, doing anything to avoid her teacher's probing look.</p>
<p>"Look, Miley," Mr. Corelli started again, his voice quieter. "Is there… is there anything going on? I know I'm your teacher, but I'd like to think that you can come to me if you need any help."</p>
<p>"There's nothing going on, Mr. C," Miley responded suddenly, lifting her head to lock eyes with him. "I just have trouble sleeping these days. I'm sorry, it won't happen again."</p>
<p>Mr. Corelli stood up from the chair and pushed it in. "That's what I like to hear, Miss Stewart. Now go on home… and <i>rest</i>."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Corelli." Miley's voice was soft, but she knew he heard her as a soft smile spread across his face. "I will see you on Monday."</p>
<p>In all honesty, Miley was in no rush to leave Mr. Corelli's classroom. After glancing at the clock, she noted that it was ten minutes after the last bell of the day. Surely there was no way her friends would still be waiting for her… she hoped they had given up on her and walked home alone. Stuffing her notebook and pencil in her backpack, Miley zipped it up and slung it over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Bye." Miley called out to Mr. Corelli before darting out of his classroom.</p>
<p>Tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear, she made her way to her locker to switch out her books. It was a rarity that she doesn't have homework, but it was one of those days, and she'd be able to save time in the morning by stopping by her locker before leaving. However, Miley stopped short as she turned the corner to get to her locker. Leaning up against her locker was Lilly Truscott, and Oliver Oken was standing in front of her.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Miley slowly approached them. Without a word, she opened her locker and switched out her books for the following day. Lilly and Oliver's conversation went on for a moment longer, but quickly died when Miley remained silent.</p>
<p>Lilly wrapped her arms around Miley's waist from behind as she pulled her books from her locker, and instantly felt the taller girl tense up beneath her.</p>
<p>"I heard you fell asleep during history – again." Lilly commented as a way of greeting before releasing her friend.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"Hey, Miley," Oliver greeted, raising a hand in a short wave.</p>
<p>Miley nodded with a small smile that soon faded. "Hi Ollie."</p>
<p>Miley slammed her locker shut and started walking towards the double doors leading out of the school. Lilly and Oliver followed her through the parking lot and onto the sidewalk. In the corner of her eye, Miley could see them cast each other questioning looks. After a moment, Lilly bounded forward and linked her arm with Miley's. Miley bit her lips as she felt the hair on her arms rise at the simple contact. Taking a deep breath, she forced a smile as they approached Rico's Shack.</p>
<p>"Look, I have a lot of homework, so I think I'm going to head home now." Miley lied through her teeth, breaking away from Lilly's grip. "I'll call you guys later."</p>
<p>"Mind if I come with you?" Lilly asked with a smile, "We can work on our homework together."</p>
<p>Miley frowned for a moment, then shrugged. "I – I just can't do anything right now, okay? But why don't you guys come over for a movie night tonight?"</p>
<p>"All right, Miley." Oliver responded before Lilly could say anything. "How about we go catch some waves, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Lilly frowned, but nodded in agreement. The two of them watched with confused eyes as Miley turned on her heels and left.</p>
<p>Lilly was all around her, her scent and warmth encompassing Miley. The dual sensations were doing nothing but heightening the arousal that was growing inside of Miley, adding only sharp bursts of pleasure as the blonde's slim fingers slid inside of her – side to side, in and out and all around, driving Miley to the edge of bliss. Lilly's other hand was splayed out against Miley's stomach, goose bumps rising beneath her smooth palm. Miley was panting heavily into Lilly's ear, her own hands on Lilly's back, fingernails scratching and <i>digging</i> into her as the girl moved inside of her. Miley's requests to <i>go deeper, go harder</i> were fulfilled as Lilly's warm fingers brought her to the height of pleasure, the blonde's lips opening against Miley's own and feeding the fire burning inside of her as she climaxed.</p>
<p>Miley let out a primal scream, Lilly's name escaped her lips between shallow, gasping breaths. The blonde wiped her fingers against Miley's sheets before she moved to lay her head against the taller girl's shoulder, her arms sliding around Miley's trembling body.</p>
<p>"Relax, Miles." Lilly whispered, her breath hot against Miley's ear. She gave Miley's ear a lick before settling back down.</p>
<p>Gasping sharply, Miley's eyes opened and darted around her room. Darkness had barely settled, and after checking her clock, she determined that it was time for her to get up and get ready for movie night with Lilly, Oliver, and his girlfriend Joannie. Although, after that dream… God, it was so real. The space between her legs throbbed with every beat of her heart, which was going pretty damn fast. She slid one hand below the waistline of her pajama bottoms, slipping beneath her underwear and into the wet heat... that Lilly had caused. Not Lilly, really, but she had dreamed of Lilly and not for the first time, and each time she woke up with a need to bring herself over the edge.</p>
<p>This would be the first time she'd ever given in to the temptation, always feeling that it was wrong to imagine her friend's warm hands against her center. She never thought she'd actually stoop so low as to do that.</p>
<p>…Then again, she never thought she'd have such erotic thoughts about Lilly Truscott.</p>
