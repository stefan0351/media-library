<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Four -->

<p>The only thing I really wonder about, besides why there are so many
stars in the sky, is if it's possible to have a romantic relationship
without really having a romantic relationship with someone. Is it
possible to act like someone's girlfriend and treat someone like a
girlfriend without the physical aspect of the entire romantic
relationship?</p>
<p>She doesn't go out with Reese anymore. She told me things weren't
really working out because she couldn't give herself up to him or
something like that. Actually, I think her exacts were, "He wants
something from me that's not really mine to give away now." I'm not
sure what I'm missing from that statement but I'm sure there's a clue
in there somewhere. I guess I'll figure it out when I figure it out.</p>
<p>We've been hanging out more too. We go out have fun and get away from
the whole superhero thing. When we're not together then I'm thinking
or talking about her. It's kind of weird. Which is my whole point of
wondering about having a romantic relationship without really having
a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>When people at the bar she works at flirt with her I get jealous. Of
course, it's not a secret that I am prone to jealousy but Helena is
the exact same way. If a guy or girl approaches me she makes sure
that they know I'm with her. My only real question is; am I with her
or are we just really good friends? I know I'm not acting like her
sister. At least I wouldn't imagine I'm acting like her sister.</p>
<p>I need help. I think I'm thinking too much. I even think that I'm
thinking too much about thinking too much. Yes I am confused and I
don't know what to do. So tonight I've actually promised myself to
ask Helena what's going on. I'm going to go to her place of
employment sit down at the bar stare at her for a few hours then when
she gets off we'll do our sweeps, hang out, and maybe then I'll
possibly ask her what's going on between us.</p>
<p>No. I have to be firm about this. I have to be committed to getting
answers. Am I sure that I want answers? Well no. But I need to get
answers. I can't continue going on acting like I'm Helena's
girlfriend when I'm not. I either am or I'm not. We either make our
relationship real or continue to pretend like we have one?</p>
<p>No. Firm. I have to be firm. Barbara's advice to me was just to talk
to Helena. I tried to get her to do it, but she wouldn't. I think she
said something about me acting like an adult. I'm not quite sure what
she meant. The least she could have done was be more upfront with me.
She was the one who sought me out to talk about what had been going
on between Helena and me. She wanted answers and when I finally gave
her some or at least told her what I knew, she just kind of rubbed
her head like she had a migraine and told me to figure things out
before something happened.</p>
<p>Okay. So here I am. I just need to walk inside and remember to stay
firm. Firm like steel. Firm like unbreakable things. Firm like
Helena's body. Oh wait. I probably shouldn't be thinking that way
right now.</p>
<p>"Hey," I say to her as I take a seat at the bar. The bouncer doesn't
even ask me for my ID anymore when I come. He knows I'm Helena's
friend and that I'm not here trying to drink underage.</p>
<p>"Hi," Her entire face lights up with her smile and all that firmness
I've been talking about just falls away. I don't really need to know
what's going on. I'm happy with the way things are. Am I still
confused? Sure I am. But I'm often confused. I can deal with
confusion as long as Helena doesn't ever decide to walk out of my
life or go out with anyone else then I'm fine.</p>
<p>"How's it going tonight?" I'm genuinely interested. Helena usually
has some funny anecdote about the patrons of the bar. I've gotten to
know the regulars pretty well.</p>
<p>She shrugs, "Nothing interesting is going on. It's actually been kind
of a slow night considering it's Saturday."</p>
<p>"Do you think it's because of this lizard guy we still don't seem
able to find?" I know this guys been in the back of her mind
recently. This guy doesn't seem to have a motive for anyone he kills
and he attacks randomly. The whole case is really frustrating.</p>
<p>"Could be," she picks up a glass and starts wiping it with the towel
she had draped over her shoulder. "The news is saying there's some
kind of serial killer out there just picking people at random and
killing them."</p>
<p>"That does kind of seem what's happening." I offer.</p>
<p>Helena sighs. "Yeah it does. But I'm sure he has some kind of motive
and we just haven't figured it out yet. There's a link we're missing."</p>
<p>"I know." And I really do know. I feel the exact same way. So does
Barbara. "But if it can be found then we're going to find it."</p>
<p>"Yeah I know," she smiles at me and I know she doesn't want me to
worry about it anymore. "So what's been going on with you? Did you do
anything terribly interesting today?"</p>
<p>"Barbara and I trained for a little while but other than that nothing
happened. Daniel called me again," I couldn't help but add. Daniel
was a Meta that I met at some school assembly that Barbara dragged me
to. He was a really nice guy and he seemed to be interesting but...well
the but was standing right in front of me.</p>
<p>"Did he ask you out?" She tried to hide it but I could hear the soft
growl that escaped from the back of her throat. Helena wasn't a big
fan of Daniel's.</p>
<p>"Yeah he did."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"Well I told him that I wasn't interested."</p>
<p>"Did he push anything?"</p>
<p>"No. He said he understood."</p>
<p>"Good." She says with a satisfied grunt.</p>
<p>I see an opportunity in front of me now and I'm afraid that if I
don't take it then it'll float off to that special place where all
those opportunities I've passed up go to. It's the place where they
retire and come out every once in a while just to mock me.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Helena looks at me confused. "Why what?"</p>
<p>"Why is it good?"</p>
<p>She looks around. I think she's checking out the best escape route
but I don't want her to be able to escape. I want an answer. I
genuinely want to know why it's good I told a relatively handsome guy
that I can't go out with him because I wasn't interested.</p>
<p>"Please Helena, just tell me why it's a good thing," I beg her with
my eyes. I need to know.</p>
<p>She looks around once again then focuses on me. "I don't like the
idea of sharing you."</p>
<p>Okay that could be a positive thing, a little possessive but still
positive. "What does that mean exactly?" My palms are sweating and
I'm surprised I haven't broken any of the bottles lying around this
place yet. I am exercising excellent control.</p>
<p>"It means you're mine. You've got my heart and I can't take it back.
You're mine."</p>
<p>Oh. Well that...I don't know what that is. I'm not going to cry. I'm
not going to cry. I should probably say something to her though. She
just kind of told me that she loves me. I guess I should kind of
return the gesture. "Well I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels
that way then." Hey that actually sounded kind of cool calm and
collected. "I'd hate to think that you had my heart when I didn't
have yours."</p>
<p>She gives me an impossibly bright smile and I don't want to do
anything else but kiss her. I have to kiss her. I have to do it now.
I have to finally be able to get that feeling from deep down inside
of me out. I'm actually contemplating jumping over the counter but I
end up not having to because Helena does it first. She's standing in
front of me leaning against my legs. I'm thankful that I'm sitting
down because if I were standing then I'd most definitely be falling.
As a matter of fact I wonder if I'm falling anyway.</p>
<p>"Does that mean you love me?" She asks leaning in closer.</p>
<p>"I guess it kind of does. But I think since I've always kind of loved
you it's not that big of a revelation or possibly just the biggest
one of my life."</p>
<p>Finally our lips meet and...it's great. It's perfect. It's...well it's
really damn good. I can't think. I can't really do anything except
feel. I feel her body pressed up against my own. I feel her taste her
touch. I feel nothing but her.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like I've found a bit of myself too. I'm not as lost
anymore and that's a wonderful, fantastic, terrific, and stupefying
feeling. I didn't know that it'd be possible for me to feel at least
partially complete at such a young age.</p>
<p>When we finally break apart I immediately look into her eyes. I need
to know if what we shared really meant as much to her as it did to
me. I want to share my feelings I want to share everything with her
and I see she wants the same thing from me. She wants to solidify
that connection we've had since before I ever came to this city.</p>
<p>We manage to tell each other that we love each other at the same
time. Then we giggle. Then I start feeling kind of shy. I don't know
what to do now. I want to kiss her again, I'd kind of like to kiss
her forever, but I don't think me laying her out on the bar would be
entirely appropriate. I haven't felt like this before. I can actually
feel her inside of me. That piece of her very unique energy is stuck
right in the pit of my stomach and it makes me feel all warm and
fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>"So..." I'm not entirely in favor of silence right now. I need to hear
her voice.</p>
<p>She clears her throat. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"What do we do now?" She's had to have experience in this area
before. I haven't. Well more accurately I have, but I don't think
that one really counts. I was just fifteen about to turn sixteen and
Katie was just my last ditch effort to be happy in a place where I
knew I didn't belong.</p>
<p>"I say we do more of this," Helena breaks me from my thoughts and
fear. Her lips are pressed to mine again but for way too short of a
time. "But other than that I don't know. I'm not an expert here."</p>
<p>"So we just continue to be together?" I ask unable to resist the urge
any longer to wrap my arms around her waist and bring her even closer
to me.</p>
<p>"That's all I want."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Me too."</p>
<p>"Hey Helena are you going to start working again sometime tonight or
should I just get my own drink? Oh and I'd like to have the same
exact service as she's having." Jared, a regular calls out to her.</p>
<p>For the first time Helena breaks eye contact with me and responds to
the restless man, "You wish." She turns her attention back to
me. "Are you going to stay the whole night?"</p>
<p>"I planned on it. I don't want to do sweeps alone."</p>
<p>Helena smiles then jumps back over the counter. I don't remember the
last time we actually did sweeps apart. We were partners now and
partners don't work alone. It was against the superhero rules or
something. She begins filling the drink requests that surround her
and I sit back and watch.</p>
<p>Barbara then interrupts my own form of entertainment when her voice
trickles through my Helena haze and straight into my ear. "Canary you
there?"</p>
<p>My best guess is that this isn't just a friendly call. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"You need to go out and meet Reece. He's got another body."</p>
<p>"The lizard guy?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Barbara sounds just about the same way I feel: frustrated and
defeated.</p>
<p>"Damn."</p>
<p>"Just do the regular tests and bring them back here. Maybe this time
we'll find something different." Barbara then proceeds to tell me
where to me Reece and wishes me good luck. I can tell that she's
trying to give me some hope that this guy hasn't beaten us yet, and I
know he hasn't. We'll stop him. I know we will. I just don't want
anyone else to die.</p>
<p>I turn to Helena and she's looking over at me knowing that I've been
called away. "Do you need me to go with you?"</p>
<p>I want her to but I know that she has to work. Plus, it's just Reece
and another poisoned body. I can handle that. So, I shake my
head. "No. I can take care of it. Reece has another one."</p>
<p>Helena hesitates but I lean over the bar and put my fingers to her
very soft lips. "I can take care of it."</p>
<p>We have a short staring contest but Helena eventually backs
off. "Fine but be careful and don't let Reese push you around."</p>
<p>"I'll be careful and I won't let Reece push me around." I
promise. "I'm just going to get some more samples anyway. I don't
think anything's going to happen." I lean forward and give her a
quick kiss. "I've got to go. Be good." I smile and let my eyes linger
just a little too long then turn around and make my way to Detective
Reece to go look at another dead body. There are certainly some
downsides to being a superhero.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Detective Reece is keeping watch over the body when I approach him.
He looks surprised to see me and I can understand why since Helena is
usually the one that meets up with him. Every time we get together
there's awkwardness. I think it's mostly because I was insanely
jealous of him for a while and because of his father. Plus, I don't
really think we work too well together. Sure, he's watched my back
and I've watched his but there's just not that thing. It's the thing
that makes Helena and I such good partners. We have the thing. With
Reese and me there's no thing.</p>
<p>"Hey," I say kind of shyly and tuck a strand of my hair behind my
ear. It's a nervous gesture that I keep on promising myself I'll get
rid of eventually.</p>
<p>"Uh...hi." He's such an articulate man. I can see what Helena saw in
him. Of course what she saw in him really doesn't matter now because
she's not with him. She's with me. I wonder if now is a good time to
fill him in on the news. "Where's Helena?" He looks behind me like he
just expects her to pop out from nowhere, which is possible, but it's
not going to happen.</p>
<p>"Busy." I look down at the body. "Anything different about this one?"</p>
<p>"No." Reece sighs heavily. He's probably just as frustrated as the
rest of us about this. "Everything is the same. Same poison, same
everything."</p>
<p>I lean down and take yet another sample for Barbara to
analyze. "Maybe something will turn up this time though."</p>
<p>"Has Oracle found out anything?"</p>
<p>I shake my head. "We're just as lost as you are." I turn to look at
him and catch a movement in the corner of my eye. When I do a very
quick double take I can barely see a shadow cast by the street lamp.
As soon as whatever it is knows that I can see it, it turns around
and begins to run. I hurriedly shove the sample I've just taken into
my jacket and take off after the shadow.</p>
<p>I can still barely see them in the night. Whatever it is is
incredibly fast. I hear Reese calling me from behind but I keep on
running. If I can just catch up with whoever this is maybe this will
all end or maybe we'll actually get somewhere. Right when I think
I've actually gained some ground on the figure it disappears. I'm
left standing in an alley alone.</p>
<p>There's a slight rustling sound to my left. I turn and am not
surprised when I see nothing. It's weird but I can actually feel
something here. I know it's around me, but I can't pinpoint where it
is. Reese has finally caught up with me and is gasping for air while
he tries to ask me what I'm doing.</p>
<p>There it is behind him. I think it's trying to get away. Oh wait it's
not. My eyes go wide when I realize it's going to go after
Reese. "Get out of the way!" I yell at him and make a desperate dive
to move him away from the figure next to and slightly behind him.</p>
<p>As I reach Reese I see some liquid being shot at us both. I do my
best to twist us both away from the spray. We hit the ground hard and
I know I'm going to have a few bruises that will only feel better
once Helena kisses them away. When I get a chance to look up I move
my head frantically searching for the dark figure that I never really
could see, but unfortunately now I can.</p>
<p>She's looking straight down at us and her eyes are red and have an
odd reptilian shape. Reece is trying to push me away from him but I
resist. I'm afraid if I move then she'll do something like try and
spit nasty poison at me again. I am beginning to think that it
probably would have been a good idea to listen to Barbara when she
told me to pick up the antidote she had made for the poison on my way
out.</p>
<p>"Dinah get off me," Reese tries to order me.</p>
<p>"Shut up." I tell him but keep my eyes trained on the woman above us.</p>
<p>She smiles at me and reaches out her hand. This may sound crazy, but
I don't trust her. I don't want to offend her by not taking her hand
though so I take her hand hoping that my skin doesn't start burning
and that I don't start dying. To my surprise nothing happens. And I
really mean nothing happens. I don't even get any type of vision from
her. Nothing.</p>
<p>"I have no quarrels with you," she informs me. "If you had not
cornered me then I wouldn't have attacked you."</p>
<p>Oh yes well that makes me feel so much better. "But you've killed all
those people."</p>
<p>"It was necessary."</p>
<p>"Necessary?" Reese and I ask at the same time.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to put you under arrest," Reese says and even I
know that's certainly not the best thing he could have said at a time
such as this.</p>
<p>The woman does nothing but laugh.</p>
<p>"Why did you do it?" I ask instead ignoring Reese's hurt pride.</p>
<p>"It was necessary." She repeats.</p>
<p>"Canary?" Barbara's voice filters through my comm. set. "Is
everything okay?"</p>
<p>I don't know how I should respond to that right now, so I don't.</p>
<p>"If you let me go then I'll let you live."</p>
<p>"We can't do that," I tell her knowing that she probably already knew
what I'd say.</p>
<p>"Fine." She shrugs and her skin becomes darker. It's quite
interesting really. She doesn't really change to blend in with her
surroundings; she just kind of gets darker. I'm sure this isn't a
good thing, but it's still interesting.</p>
<p>I get into a fighting stance, hoping that she doesn't decide to spit
anymore poison at me. We circle each other and Reese moves off to the
side. His hand moves to his gun and he begins to pull it out slowly
but this reptilian woman sees him and quickly spits some more of her
very special saliva in his direction. This time, she actually hits
him but this distraction gives me a chance to concentrate hard enough
on throwing the woman into a wall. I've been becoming quite good at
that lately.</p>
<p>"Oracle," I scream into my comm. set. "Reese got hit with the poison.
I need the antidote and an ambulance."</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" She asks and I can tell she's worried. "What
happened?"</p>
<p>"Our lizard guy is actually a lizard girl. She's knocked out for the
moment, but I think she might be waking up soon." I can actually
already begin to see her stirring. "Get Huntress here quick."</p>
<p>I turn away from Reese and look around desperately trying to find
something I can use to cover this woman's mouth. During my search I
fail to notice that she has already recovered. For some reason, I
don't fully understand, she doesn't try to kill me with her poison
she just kicks me in the back and starts to run off. I know I should
chase after her, but I don't want to leave Reese alone. Damn it.</p>
<p>"Oracle where's Huntress?"</p>
<p>"She's on her way. So is the ambulance. Is everything okay?"</p>
<p>"No. She got away."</p>
<p>Moments later Helena is by my side over Reese with the antidote. She
follows Barbara's instructions on how to give it to Reese, which
really isn't that difficult. It mostly just consists of stick needle
in arm and push down. The ambulance arrives and Reese is on his away
to the hospital. He'll most likely live.</p>
<p>Helena and I watch the ambulance pull away. She's standing next to me
and her arm is wrapped around my waist. "Are you okay?" She asks as
we stare at the fading red and white lights.</p>
<p>"I let her get away."</p>
<p>"You did fine. So what she got away. At least you're alive and Reese
isn't going to die. Plus, now we know who our mystery lizard is."</p>
<p>"When did you become so optimistic?" I turn in her arms so that I'm
no longer facing the street but facing her.</p>
<p>She smirks. "I don't know."</p>
<p>There's silence now and I'm just happy to be in Helena's arms. I'm
safe in them and after thinking that I was going to die for a while
earlier I'm happy that she's here.</p>
<p>"So are you ready to go see how Reese is doing?" Helena asks me.</p>
<p>I know we should go to the hospital. He is kind of our semi-
partner. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"Be careful out there tonight ladies," Oracle calls to us through the
comm. set. "Remember that woman is still loose. And tell Reese that I
hope he starts to feel better. I'll be checking up on the city while
you're there."</p>
<p>With Oracle watching out for us from above we begin to make our way
to the hospital. I think it's going to be a long night.</p>
