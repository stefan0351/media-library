<p>A/N: I'm pretty sure this is the shortest chapter and I'm not quite sure I'm happy with it, but this is the end of the story. I plan on writing more though, so no worries. Please continue to R&R. I really appreciate it. Hope you enjoy :)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>We were kissing. It wasn't much of anything at first…I kind of just had my lips against hers. Still, it was happening and it was amazing. I never thought Miley's lips could feel so good against mine but they did.</p>
<p>It took a second for Miley to respond, but eventually I felt her lips start to move against mine. It was started out slow, like she was testing the situation out…like she was scared that I was going to jump back and run out of the room. I couldn't blame her.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the pace picked up and she had her hands on the back of my head pushing my lips hard into hers. I was probably going to have bruised lips, but I didn't care at all. All I cared about was not letting Miley go.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, she pulled away first. I hadn't really expected that. I didn't want to stop. I never wanted to stop. She looked at me with a mixture of shock and excitement in her face.</p>
<p>"What just happened?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Um…I'm not exactly sure."</p>
<p>"You just kissed me."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah," I said. I wasn't really thinking straight. "Why aren't we kissing now?" I leaned in to kiss her, but she pushed me away.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Not two minutes ago you said you just wanted to be friends and now you can't keep your hands off me? What's going on Lilly?"</p>
<p>I took a step back and looked at Miley. "Oh…sorry, I'm probably being really confusing right now. I lied." In my head, that was a lot better explanation than it was when it came out.</p>
<p>"You lied? You lied about what?"</p>
<p>"I lied about not wanting to be with you. Being with you would be selfish, and I didn't want to ruin your life, so I told you I didn't wanna be with you."</p>
<p>"Wait…huh? Why would us being together ruin my life?" she asked.</p>
<p>Y'know, it's really hard to answer questions when all you can think about is pinning the questioner up against the wall and having your way with her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. My brain isn't working at all. Let me start from the beginning. I read your diary yesterday. Finding out you were in love with me was one of the scariest things I've ever had to deal with. It took a lot of thinking…and a little chat with Oliver who can be weirdly intuitive about things sometimes, for me to realize that I had feelings for you too."</p>
<p>"Okay, so I read in your diary that your dad might not approve of you being gay and I didn't want him to disown you, so I figured it would be easier if I just didn't act on what I was feeling. But y'know what? It's not easier. It broke my heart and I know it broke yours. So I don't care if it's selfish of me, and I don't care if we have to try to make it on the street. I love you Miley Stewart and I want to be with you." I kissed Miley again. This time I pulled back to see Miley with a huge, goofy smile on her face.</p>
<p>"You love me?" she asked. It was like she couldn't believe what was happening. Hell, I couldn't believe this was happening.</p>
<p>"Yes, I love you." This time, she kissed me. This kiss was different than the other two. There wasn't all the uncertainty that the others had had. This one was just filled with passion and love. She licked my bottom lip and I opened my mouth to let her tongue in. The sensation sent shivers down my spine. She pulled herself backwards onto the bed and I ended up on top of her. I pulled away for a second.</p>
<p>"Miley, we're on the bed…"</p>
<p>"Yeah, is that bad? Do you wanna stop?"</p>
<p>"No! No it's just, we just started out. I just don't wanna go too fast too soon. Not that I don't want you. I really, REALLY want you, I just don't want us to-" I got cut off by her lips crashing into mine. She pulled back.</p>
<p>"I don't wanna over think this. Whatever happens…happens. If either one of us wants to stop, we will." With that, I smiled and started kissing her again. We kissed for a while and I moved to her neck. I sucked on her pulse point and she let out a soft moan. Ugh, it drove me crazy, so I sucked a little harder and she moaned a little louder. I slipped my hand up her shirt. Right as I started to work on getting her bra undone, I heard the door open…Miley's dad was standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>I jumped off of Miley and tried to straighten up my clothes. Miley did something similar. She looked terrified. I felt the same exact way. I was terrified of what he might do to me. Even more than that, I was scared of what he'd do to Miley. I never thought I'd have to be afraid of Mr. Stewart. I felt like we'd been standing there forever (even though it was probably only about ten seconds or so), and I felt like I had to say something.</p>
<p>"Um, hi Mr. Stewart…this isn't what it looks like."</p>
<p>"Really? Because it looks like you had my daughter pinned on her bed." It was weird. When he said that, he didn't seem angry. He almost had a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Daddy, I can explain-"</p>
<p>"It's okay bud. I'm just glad you two made up after your fight yesterday. Just make sure you two don't let things get too carried away or I'm not gonna let you shut the door anymore."</p>
<p>"Wait," I said. "You don't care that we're a couple?"</p>
<p>"Lilly, I haven't cared for the last year. Why would I start caring now?" Mr. Stewart just walked away.</p>
<p>Miley and I just stared at the doorway, dumbstruck. I just looked at Miley and laughed. What had happened over the passed 24 hours had seemed like it came out of left field to me. After listening to Oliver and Miley's dad, it seems like it's been a long time coming. Miley started laughing too.</p>
<p>"So," Miley said between laughs, "are we gonna start where we left off?"</p>
<p>I just smiled and pulled her into a long kiss.</p>
<p>I'm thinking this was the best day of my life.</p>
