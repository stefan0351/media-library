<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 6-->

<p>"Sam!"</p>

<p>"What!?!" Sam exclaimed practically jumping out of her skin.  "Decaf Carm,
decaf."</p>

<p>"Don't decaf me, you're the one who's moon-walking.  What's wrong with you?"
Carmyn asked as she looked at her friend oddly.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Sam asked turning around, even as she realized
that she had no idea what Carmyn had been saying to her before she yelled
out her name.</p>

<p>"You've been walking around all week with this goofy expression on your face
and glassy look in your eyes.  You didn't eat any of those brownie's Emory
was handing out this morning, did you!?!" Carm asked alarmed as the thought
suddenly struck her.</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded shaking her head.  "I'm just in a good mood.  Not even I
can be a walking, talking tragedy 24/7.  Things are just better at the
hacienda now, that's all."</p>

<p>"You didn't kill her did you?"  Carm asked looking at Sam who had a
disconcertingly serene look on her face.  It was bewildering because Carmyn
had never seen Sam quite so relaxed, so content in the entire time that they
had known each other, and they had known each other for quite a while.</p>

<p>"Let's just say that we reached a new understanding," Sam replied her lips
twitching into a smile before she turned away trying to hide whatever
emotions might be showing on her face.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Carmyn pulled Lily back as she spotted Sam about to turn around and look
behind her.  When Carm thought the coast was clear she let go of Lily and
waved her forward.  They had been trailing Sam, who was being suspiciously
cautious-though apparently with reason, for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Tell me again why we're trailing her?" Lily whispered to Carm as the tip
toed down the hall.</p>

<p>"Because Sam is our friend, and if something is wrong we have to know about
so that we can help her.  Likewise, if something is really good, we need to
know about it so that we can encourage and support her," Carmyn responded.</p>

<p>"Right," Lily responded, not really convinced at all.  "Why don't we just
ask her?"</p>

<p>"I did and she won't spill it.  What kind of friends would we be if we just
let her get away with that?  That's right, bad," Carmyn responded answering
her own question before Lily could respond.  She knew that she was being
slightly under handed but really, it was for a good cause.</p>

<p>Ducking behind a wall they watched as Sam came to a stop.  A moment later
Brooke came into their view and stopped just in front of  Sam.</p>

<p>"See, it's a good thing the cavalry's here," Carm commented when Brooke
entered the picture.  Lily was about to respond but Sam started to talk and
they both shut up so that they could here what was being said.</p>

<p>"This is so…clandestine," Sam said softly.  "I feel like I should be calling
you Lilac or something."</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke responded.  "Sorry.  But it's kind of hard to give advance
warning for surprises.  It kind of makes them…well not," she went on dipping
her head down shyly a bit.  Sam saw the movement and smiled.  Brooke could
be unbelievably cute when she was nervous.</p>

<p>"A surprise?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  I mean I suppose I could have given it to you later…but that would
have gone against the whole impatient thing so…you know," Brooke said
reaching into her pocket.  "It's nothing special, I just remembered…I mean
you said that you needed something historic for your class…so…" Brooke
finished lamely placing something in Sam's hand.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this?" Sam asked softly as she looked down at the pendant
in her hand.  It was exquisite.</p>

<p>"It was my mothers.  It's Saxon, almost three hundred years old.  Or so she
said.  It looks old anyway.  I figured you could just make something up
about it since I don't really know, and…"  Brooke trailed off shifting her
feet uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Sam said placing her hand under Brooke's chin and raising her
head so that she could see Brooke's eyes.  She was incredibly touched by the
gesture, not only that Brooke remembered something she had just mentioned in
passing, but that what she had been given had belonged to Brooke's mom.  A
subject Sam knew was painful for Brooke.</p>

<p>They stared at each other in silence for a moment after that, then Sam
leaned forward and pressed her lips against Brooke's softly.  As Brooke
placed her hand on Sam's hip the pressure between their lips increasing
slightly as they stayed connected in that tender embrace for a minute before
pulling back.</p>

<p>"I'll see you later," Brooke said as she took a step back.  This wasn't the
time and it definitely wasn't the place for them to get lost in each other.
She had learned that it was best to remove herself from temptation when
temptations name was Sam.</p>

<p>They stood there for a moment longer, looking at each other warmly before
turning around and heading back in the directions they had come from.</p>

<p>"Ohmygod," Carmyn breathed out once the lovebirds where out of sight.
"Ohmygod."</p>

<p>"Ohmygod," Lily said as well, her voice barely a whisper.</p>

<p>"I think I covered that," Carm responded.</p>

<p>"Did we just see what I think we saw?" Lily asked staring at the spot the
two girls had been standing in before.</p>

<p>"If you saw what I saw then I think we saw what we saw," Carmyn responded as
she tried to wrap her mind around what she had just witnessed.</p>

<p>"It would explain a lot," Lily commented thoughtfully.  "The sudden
happiness, the absence of bitch fights…the nights suddenly spent at home."</p>

<p>"But…Brooke?  They hate each other," Carmyn responded, even though she had
to admit that evidence was pretty conclusive that they couldn't have
disliked each that much.  After all she didn't go around tongue kissing
Nicole or Mary Cherry.</p>

<p>"Love rarely makes sense.  Besides, you know the saying," Lily replied.</p>

<p>"There's a thin line between love and hate," Carmyn answered dutifully.  "Or
in this case a thin sheet."</p>

<p>"You don't think they've…do you?" Lily asked as she tried not to picture
what what she was asking would look like.</p>

<p>"They live in the same house, a house that's deserted currently expect for
them, and they've been spending their nights holed up in there…together.
It's a distinct possibility," Carmyn replied logically.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you want to do an intervention," Lily said seeing that look
in her friends eyes.  "We're not even suppose to know about this."</p>

<p>"But we do," Carmyn responded, "and I don't see why this should change our
original mission objective.  We spied so that we could ultimately encourage
and support Sam in her happiness.  The fact that the source of said
happiness happens to have shocked the hell out of us doesn't matter.
Besides, the fact that she hasn't said anything just proves that she needs
our support, that she's scared."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Lily agreed grudgingly.</p>

<p>"Then it's decided," Carmyn stated as they began to make their way back to a
less deserted area of the school.</p>

<p>"They're an insanely good looking couple," Lily commented dismally as they
walked.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Carm responded.</p>

<p>"She's lucky to have friends like us.  You know, who will support her
shamefully good-looking union," Lily went on.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Carm responded.</p>

<p>"Do you want ice-cream?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."
