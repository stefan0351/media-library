<!-- For the Love of Miss Bard \ Part 5-->

<P>"Beep, beep, beep" The alarm sounded as Alex
  turned reaching over to hit the tab of the clock. Her head was clouded and she
  felt groggy. After Kathryn left the night before, she tried to sleep but up
  until the early hours of the morning her mind kept drifting back to the teacher.
  Alex wanted to have a relationship with her, she knew that much. She also knew
  that she wouldn't be able to work with her on Wednesdays anymore. There's no
  way I'd be able to get through that time without wanting to touch her, to feel
  her oh god...Al ex found herself once again fantasizing about the green eyed
  woman that captured her heart like being struck by a bolt of lightning. Alex
  suddenly heard the front door open. She jumped out of bed and walk toward the
  door. </P>
<P>"Alex honey are you up" Cyrene called as she
  walked into the house suddenly realizing Alex was standing in the living room.
  "Oh you are." She laughed. </P>
<P>"Mom what are you doing here?" Alex asked complete
  forgetting the fact that she had a doctor's appointment.</P>
<P>"Oh boy Alex, you forgot about your appointment."
  Cyrene spoke as she shook her head.</P>
<P>"Shit, I...damn it...you came to take Sam to
  school?" </P>
<P>"Honey you'd better get a move on it, traffic
  is building up already. I'll get Sam ready for breakfast, then I'll drop her
  off OK." Cyrene spoke as she headed toward her granddaughter's room.</P>
<P>"Yea, OK...thanks mom." Alex turned toward her
  room to get dressed. She had been wearing an oversized T-shirt she changed into
  after Kathryn let the night before.</P>
<P>"Oh shit I'm not going to see Kathryn this morning."
  Alex turned and went to Sam's room. "Mom?" She called.</P>
<P>"What honey." Cyrene turned to look up at her
  daughter. </P>
<P>"Morning mama." Sam said as she climbed out
  of bed and up into her mother's arms.</P>
<P>"How'd my sweetheart sleep last night?"</P>
<P>"Good, are you gowing to doctor''s today? you
  gonna get a shot?" </P>
<P>"I don't think so honey." Alex laughed. I hope
  not. </P>
<P>"Mom can you tell Kath...I mean Miss Bard that
  I'll see her after school. Tell her I had to go to the doctor's for a check
  up OK?" </P>
<P>"Do you tell Miss Bard every....Oooohhhh....
  Um....aha... yea I'll tell her... Soooo is she your special someone?" Cyrene
  already had the answer as she saw her daughter begin to blush.</P>
<P>"Mother...please." Alex suddenly felt flustered.
  I must be in love. She could feel the butterflies in her stomach at the thought
  of not seeing Kathryn this morning.</P>
<P>Cyrene raised her eyebrows and grinned. She
  wrapped her arms around Alex. "Don't worry, I'm sure she'll miss not seeing
  you too". </P>
<P>Damn how does she do that. Alex thought. I guess
  mother's really do know. </P>
<P>Kathryn was outside the fenced area when she
  saw Sam coming up around the corner. Her heartbeat began to pick up but nearly
  came to a stop when she saw Alex's mother following behind. She breathed in
  a sharp breath. Where's Alex? Why isn't she with Sam? Oh I hope she's not having
  second thoughts. Kathryn felt her insecurities rise to the surface. </P>
<P>"Hi Miss Bard." Sam called out excitedly. </P>
<P>"Where's your mommy?" Kathryn asked a little
  to hastily. </P>
<P>"Oh she's fine, she told me to tell you that
  she had a doctor's appointment and she'll see you after school." Cyrene interrupted
  as she could see the distressed look on Miss Bard's face.</P>
<P>Miss Bard let out a breath. "Is she all right?"
  she swallowed harshly. </P>
<P>"Yes, she's fine, she's just been putting off
  her checkups. Sooo, I hear you had a nice time this weekend." Cyrene stated
  as she reached out and touched Miss Bard's forearm.</P>
<P>Kathryn felt the warm blush as it engulfed her
  neck and face. "We...um...yea..."</P>
<P>was all that she could muster out.</P>
<P>Cyrene laughed out. "Don't worry, honey I had
  to practically push her out of the house to go to her appointment. She'll be
  here later." She reassured the teacher.</P>
<P>Miss Bard smiled and patted Cyrene's hand in
  return. </P>
<P>As it turned out, Alex did have to get a shot.
  She had to have some blood tests done and a tetanus that she hadn't had in quite
  a few years. She went back home and waited till almost twelve before leaving
  to pick up Sam. </P>
<P>As the bell rang, Alex saw Miss Bard step out
  of the room holding open the door as the Kindergartners piled through. Alex
  felt her heartbeat quicken and her hands began to sweat. Stay calm she thought
  to herself as she tried to slow her breathing.</P>
<P>Miss Bard immediately saw the object of her
  desire standing in her usual spot. Thank goodness, she's here. I thought I was
  going to go crazy if I didn't see her. Kathryn suddenly feeling relieved. It
  had seemed like the longest four hours of her life. As green eyes met blue it
  was as though everything and everybody was no longer in existence. The connection
  was powerful, it took all of Kathryn's effort to look away and make sure the
  kids were all returned to their proper keepers. </P>
<P>Alex moved up slowly, she met Sam's welcoming
  arms and kissed her on the cheek, then her gaze returned to the lovely Miss
  Bard. "Hi." She whispered. </P>
<P>"Are you OK?" Kathryn answered back.</P>
<P>"Oh, yea ... just a routine checkup I had been
  putting off." </P>
<P>Sam saw the Band-Aid on her mommy's arm. "oooohhh
  mommy you got a shot." </P>
<P>Kathryn looked at her arm too. "oooh" she said
  as her fingers stroked up against the injected area.</P>
<P>"uh huh." She spoke gazing into the smaller
  woman's eyes. </P>
<P>"Hey Kat, you about ready for lunch?"</P>
<P>Kathryn turned to see Christie walking toward
  them. "Lunch...oh" She had made plans the previous week with her coworker. She
  turned to look at Alex and saw a disappointed look. "Did you want to do something
  later when I get off work." She whispered.</P>
<P>Alex grinned. "Well, I'll be running tonight,
  my usual route." </P>
<P>It was Kathryn's turn to grin then she raised
  her eyebrow mimicking Alex. "Around six?"</P>
<P>"Uh huh." Was all she said as she turned to
  walk away with Sam. </P>

<hr>

<P>Finally six O'clock came around, Kathryn had
  been meandering around the house since she got off of work. She was very eager
  to see her long legged beauty. </P>
<P>Kathryn wanted to be with Alex, but she didn't
  want it to be just a sexual relationship. She decided earlier that she would
  talk to Alex and find out where she stood and what Alex wanted out of this.
  </P>
<P>The door bell brought her out of her daydreaming.
  </P>
<P>"Come in, it's open she called to the person
  standing behind the door." </P>
<P>Alex walked in and saw Kathryn setting out some
  coffee cups. "Hey." She smiled.</P>
<P>Her stomach still had a knot wrapped inside
  of it. Alex wanted to sit and talk and was so surprised to see Kathryn had wanted
  the same thing. </P>
<P>"Hi, I...um figured we could sit and chat for
  a bit?" Kathryn let out questioningly.</P>
<P>"Sure, I was hoping you'd like to talk." </P>
<P>Both women sat on the sofa leaving a partial
  space between them. </P>
<P>"Alex, I feel like we are moving really fast.
  I mean, gosh, I wanted to take things slow and get to know you better, but I
  couldn't keep my hands off you. </P>
<P>I don't think I've ever felt like this before."
  Kathryn spoke quickly her eyes darted to the floor and then back up at Alex
  waiting for a response. </P>
<P>Alex let out a long breath. "I know what you
  mean. Believe me I didn't think I was going to make it after you left last night.
  I really want this to work, I like you a lot and want us to have a chance at
  something I know will be special."</P>
<P>Kathryn was surprised to hear Alex felt the
  same way. She was also very happy. She let her arm snake over the top of the
  sofa and rub Alex on the shoulder. Alex breathed deeply again releasing noisily.
  She then scooted over and leaned in to the smaller woman for a hug. </P>
<P>Kathryn accepted the embrace and began to ministrate
  circles on Alex's back and neck. "Hmm that feels good." Alex moaned. </P>
<P>Kathryn rubbed her cheek on Alex's hair, then
  she moved sideways cheek touching
cheek. Both pairs of lips found each other and
  began a slow pull toward one another until they were connected. Heat and moisture
  formed between the two pair of lips as they both gradually opened accepting
  the offering of the other's tongue.</P>
<P>What started out as a slow and passionate kiss
  turned into a fully ignited fire. Kathryn felt her body falling toward the end
  of the sofa as Alex guided her. One hand was behind Kathryn's head and the other
  on her side. </P>
<P>"Beepbeepbeep."</P>
<P>"What's that?" Kathryn looked at Alex's watch.
  </P>
<P>"Damn I set my watch for an hour. My mom is
  going to her bingo game." </P>
<P>Kathryn began to laugh. "Well, I guess where
  gonna take it slow after all." </P>
<P>"Yea, seems like it." Alex laughed.</P>
<P>"Hey can you get your mom to watch Sam on Saturday?"
  </P>
<P>"I guess why."</P>
<P>"Oh I have some plans for you and me and some
  honey." </P>
<P>"Honey" Alex repeated as she arched her eye
  brow. </P>
<P>"Yea, I've been thinking about this since last
  night." Kathryn wrapped her arms around Alex grabbing her rear and pulling her
  toward her. </P>
<P>"Hey" Alex yelped.</P>
<P>"Hmmm honey." Kathryn seductively spoke then
  brought her head up to meet awaiting lips.</P>

<hr>

<P>Wednesday wasn't as hard as Alex thought it
  would be, she kept to one side of the room and entertained the students with
  a few stories and then helped with coloring at her station. The hardest part
  was trying not to look at Miss Bard to long. Alex could sense everytime Miss
  Bard looked at her. The connection between them was definitely getting stronger.
  The pair had decided they wouldn't see each other until Saturday which made
  for a long week.</P>
<P>Both women chitchatted briefly when Alex would
  pick Sam up after school but it was getting really hard to keep the thoughts
  of their previous love making away.</P>
<P>Finally Saturday rolled around and Alex found
  she was a nervous wreck. She wanted so badly to be with Kathryn, she hoped her
  daughter's teacher felt the same.</P>
<P>After dropping Sam off at grandma's house Alex
  gave her mother the phone number of where she'd most likely be for the rest
  of the evening. </P>
<P>Kathryn was at home making dinner, she wanted
  everything to be just right. She set up candles on the dinning table and had
  soft music playing in the background. She decided to wear one of her favorite
  evening gowns. It was an amazon green dress that accentuated her bosom pushing
  them slightly over the edge. The skirt flowed just above her knees. The color
  deepened her eyes to a more solid green with just a hint of gold. </P>
<P>Alex wasn't sure if they were going out so she
  played it safe and wore a pair black of slacks with a very light blue satin
  blouse. Her hair was left hanging loosely around her shoulders, and just a dab
  of lipstick to enhance her color.</P>
<P>"Ding, dong." The door bell rang.</P>
<P>Alex was looking down at the ground when the
  door opened. Her eyes darted from Kathryn's shoes and slowly moved up the length
  of her body. Alex's breath caught at the vision of the smaller woman. She felt
  a shiver run over her, yet she was hot. A moisture gathered between her legs.
  "Oooh." she breathed as her eyes were given the privilege of admiring this beautiful
  creature.</P>
<P>"You like?" Kathryn spoke seductively.</P>
<P>"Hmmm, I like." Alex returned as she walked
  into the smaller woman's arms for a welcoming embrace. "Hmmm, you smell so good."
  Alex breathed in her scented hair.</P>
<P>She could actually feel her knees begin to weaken
  as Kathryn moved up on her tip toes to capture the taller woman's lips. </P>
<P>"oooohh, I miss this." Kathryn spoke once releasing
  the captured lips. "I know it's only been a few days since I've kissed you,
  but It seems like eternity to me. 'Look at my hands," Kathryn held her hands
  in front of her so Alex could see. "They're shaking."</P>
<P>"Well, that's nothing...here..." Alex took one
  of Kathryn's hands and held it close to her breast. Kathryn moaned. "feel my
  heart it's about ready to jump out of my chest."</P>
<P>Kathryn's hand remained where it was placed
  as Alex leaned down and kissed her companion once again. Kathryn's hand without
  permission from it's owner began to massage the soft fabric searching for the
  erected nipple it knew was in the area.</P>
<P>It was Alex who broke first from the electrifying
  embrace. "Can we sit down before I fall down?" Alex panted as she spoke. </P>
<P>Kathryn's head was clouded, her nostrils filled
  with the scent of Alex. "I ah...made dinner for us." She spoke as she pulled
  Alex toward the kitchen. "But I figured we could eat later." She said as she
  continued pulling Alex past the kitchen and toward her bedroom. </P>
<P>Alex briefly saw the dinning table, then turned
  her eyes to feast on the younger woman who was pulling her toward the bedroom.
  </P>
<P>The room was glowing orange with a few candles
  Kathryn had set up earlier. Just as she got to the bed, she turned to faced
  Alex. </P>
<P>Alex leaned down and softly kissed Kathryn's
  cheek. She moved her mouth toward the side of Kathryn's head and breathed into
  her ear. "I think I'm falling in love with you Miss Bard."</P>
<P>Kathryn felt her body shudder at the sound of
  Alex's admission. "ooooh!" She sighed. "I hope so..." She breathed "because
  I already know I love you Alex." </P>
<P>"REALLY." Alex lifted her head to face the smaller
  woman. </P>
<P>"Yes, really." Kathryn swallowed.</P>
<P>Alex could see the hunger, the desire and the
  need in Kathryn's eyes. She knew that Kathryn could see the same thing in her
  own. </P>
<P>Kathryn reached over to unbutton Alex's blouse.
  She pulled it back and let it drop to the floor. Alex's bra was a pale blue
  similar to her blouse. Kathryn could see the nipples through the shear fabric.
  She leaned in and kiss Alex's left breast leaving a wet impression on the fabric.
  </P>
<P>Alex put both hands on Kathryn's shoulders,
  she used her thumbs to pull down the spaghetti straps. She then reached behind
  Kathryn and slowly unzipped the back.</P>
<P>Alex gasped in awe as the dress fell to the
  floor leaving the lovely Miss Bard completely bare. Alex's eyes widened as they
  took in every exposed inch of the breathtaking teacher.</P>
<P>She was so excited she didn't know what to do
  first. So Kathryn wrapped her arms around the taller woman and guided her in
  for another kiss. "Unbutton your pants." Kathryn whispered.</P>
<P>Alex did as she was asked. She took them off
  with her panties included. Kathryn pulled the bra straps off and unclasped the
  back so Alex could let it fall to the floor.</P>
<P>Kathryn put her hands on either side of Alex's
  waist as she laid down on the bed and guided Alex on top. Alex's hair fell over
  to one side as she turned her head to meet awaiting lips.</P>
<P>The passion that ran between them was just the
  beginning of a lifelong journey into foreverness.</P>

<hr>

<P>Alex was sitting on her favorite chair, she
  watched as her two granddaughters opened their Christmas presents.</P>
<P>"Honey you want some tea?" A voice called from
  the kitchen. </P>
<P>"Alex?"</P>
<P>"Alex, are you OK?" A silver haired woman stood
  over Alex and gently tapped her on the shoulder.</P>
<P>Alex looked up and smiled. "Hi." She said as
  she looked into the most beautiful green eyes she knew she would ever see. </P>
<P>"Whatcha doing?" The smaller woman asked. </P>
<P>I was remembering when Sam was in Kindergarten.
  These two will be starting school soon.</P>
<P>"Hmmm." The retired teacher replied.</P>
<P>"What were you remembering?"</P>
<P>"Oh, a beautiful young teacher who captured
  my heart." Alex looked up at Kathryn not seeing the twenty years that past through
  them, seeing only the forever lovely Miss Bard.</P>
<P>Kathryn pushed Alex slightly over as she sat
  on top of her. "Tell me." She said.</P>
<P>"From the first time I laid eyes on you I fell
  in love and when you kissed me and held me in your arms I knew I had been captured."
  </P>
<P>It was just passed midnight and Samantha came
  down stairs. She had grown into a beautiful woman. "Thanks for the present moms
  she leaned in and kissed her mothers on the cheek." As time went by she began
  calling her former kindergarten teacher mom too.</P>
<P>"Let's go to bed." Alex spoke softly as she
  hinted for the other half of her soul to get up.</P>
<P>Sam guided her daughters toward her old bed
  room. </P>
<P>Kathryn walked to the kitchen to turn off the
  lights. </P>
<P>"Kat, my love," Alex called.</P>
<P>"Hmmm."</P>
<P>"Bring the honey." Alex spoke arching her eyebrows
  up and down. </P>
<P>"Hmmm the honey." Kathryn grinned and remembered.
  </P>
<P>During there love making that Saturday night
  long ago Kathryn had set aside a jar of honey. She laid Alex on her back and
  using her finger soaked up some of the sweet nectar from the jar.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?" Alex looked above her
  head to see Kathryn dipping her finger.</P>
<P>"Shhh." Kathryn whispered as she let the golden
  fluid run down her finger and drop on top of Alex's nipple. "Mmmm." She moaned
  as she leaned in and began to tenderly lick the sweet liquid. </P>
<P>Alex arched her back up toward Kathryn and allowed
  the Kindergarten teacher to feast.</P>
<P>Alex felt the trickle down her abdomen followed
  by a heated tongue that kissed and licked up the sweet residue. "Oh that feels
  sooo goood." Alex moaned.</P>
<P>She felt the liquid run between her thighs.
  "Ooooh Kathryn hmmm." </P>
<P>Kathryn was delighted at the reaction she was
  getting from the beautiful woman lying beneath her.</P>
<P>Slowly she licked until Alex couldn't take it
  anymore. "Kathryn.....please....Oh....please" Alex cried out. </P>
<P>Kathryn used all she had in her...her body,
  her heart, her soul to love this woman.</P>
<P>"Kat you coming up." Alex called from the stairwell.
  </P>
<P>"Hey Kat..."</P>
<P>Kathryn returned to the present and stood looking
  up to her love. "I love you Alex." She spoke.</P>
<P>"I love you to Kathryn Bard."</P>
<P>Alex reached her hand down and took hold of
  Kathryn's. "Inseparable" She said looking into green eyes that spoke volumes.
  </P>
<P>"Yea...inseparable."</P>
<P>Both turned and headed up stairs. Kathryn carrying
  a jar of honey. </P>
