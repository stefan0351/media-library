<!-- Gremlins \ Part One -->

<p>Gabrielle wrapped up the bread and cheese in a
small cloth and handed it to the old man. &quot;Are you sure you won't stay here with us
tonight?&quot; She asked as he took the small bundle.</p>

<p>&quot;No lass, but thank ye' all the same. I'll
just be on my way. It's not far to my brother's cabin. I should be there before it gets
much darker. I do thank you for all your kindness though. A place to rest for a bit, a
little food and the gentle company of a beautiful young woman.&quot; He patted her hand
and smiled.</p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled back, that great big infectious
smile she had when she got the opportunity to talk with someone new. Xena just sat on a
rock and watched the two with a bemused smile as she ate some fresh rabbit stew. The bard
and Dardin, as he had become known to them, had spent the entire day talking and telling
each other stories. The old man had joined them on the road after Xena had saved him from
a couple of road bandits who thought it virtuous to rob an old man. He had traveled from
the Emerald Isle to visit his brother and had nearly made it when he ran into the thugs. </p>

<p>Gabrielle of course had been more than happy to
offer the protection of a certain warrior princess for the rest of his trip. Xena just
groaned from atop her position on Argo and proceeded down the road with the two of them
trailing behind talking and laughing. </p>

<p>Xena had decided to make camp early that day.
Argo had a loose shoe and she needed time to fix it before it got dark. So with camp set
up she went off to tend to Argo leaving the bard and her new found friend to continue
their nonstop exchanges. First he'd tell a story and then the bard would, back and forth,
it had been like that all day and the warrior needed some peace and quiet. As evening
settled in and with Argo's shoe repaired Xena returned to the camp. On the edge of camp
she stopped to watch them for a moment.</p>

<p>Gabrielle sat mesmerized as Dardin told her
another tale. Her eyes never left his face as her hand unconsciously stirred the stew with
a wooden spoon. &quot;And that's how leprechauns came to be on the Emerald Isle.&quot;
Dardin finished his tale and sat back, satisfied that he had finally topped the little
bard.</p>

<p>Xena on the other hand, just dropped her head and
shook it from side to side when she heard the word leprechauns. &quot;You have no idea
what you have started for me here tonight, old man.&quot; She mumbled to no one in
particular as she made it the rest of the way into camp. &quot;So what smells so
good?&quot; She asked as she knelt down next to Gabrielle and looked into the pot.</p>

<p>&quot;Rabbit stew.&quot; Gabrielle answered with
a hint of fear in her voice. She looked up at Xena and tried to smile. &quot;It's ready if
you&#146;re hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I'm hungry all right, but let me wash up
first I smell like sweaty horse.&quot; A protest could be heard from Argo in the distance.
&quot;Sorry!&quot; Xena called over her shoulder and made her way to the stream to clean
up a little.</p>

<p>When she returned Dardin was preparing to leave.
She took her stew and took her perch on top of the rock to watch them. She ate as they
said goodbye to each other. The old man gave Gabrielle a hug and turned to Xena. Slowly he
approached her as she lowered the bowl.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you again warrior. I owe you a great
debt.&quot; He said quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;You've made Gabrielle very happy today, you
owe me nothing.&quot; She said with a smile. &quot;Are you sure you won't stay the
night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I'll be fine. My brother is expecting
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So be it. Be careful Dardin.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man left the camp and Xena returned to
the fire to be with Gabrielle. The bard smiled at her as she ate her own stew. She chewed
for a moment, then, &quot;Xena...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Gabrielle there are no leprechauns in
Greece.&quot; She said with a smile without looking at the bard.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure.&quot; They ate in silence. A
smile played on the lips of the warrior as the brow of the bard showed her worry. 'I know
I'm gonna go straight to Tartarus for this, but...' thought Xena as she picked her next
words carefully. &quot;There can't be leprechauns in Greece Gabrielle...&quot;</p>

<p>She looked over at Xena. &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>Trying desperately to hold back the smile that
wanted to break through. &quot;Because in Greece we have gremlins.&quot; She turned her
head and smiled as her body shook slightly with silent laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;What? We have what?&quot;</p>

<p>Xena choked back the smile and the laughter and
continued. &quot;Gremlins Gabrielle we have gremlins in Greece.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What's a gremlin?&quot;</p>

<p>Xena cleared her throat and put on her best
straight face before turning to the bard. &quot;Don't know for sure. I've never actually
seen one,&quot; fighting back the smile &quot;They're invisible you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I didn't know. I didn't even know we had
gremlins.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. I've been told that they're
about so high,&quot; She held her thumb and forefinger apart about the length of her index
finger. &quot;Long ears, round little heads, squat little bodies, two arms, two
legs...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena you're joking. You're playing with me
now...right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I'm serious that's what I've been told
about gremlins.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly the bard realized the warrior was
teasing her. The warrior knew she had been caught and she released the laughter that she
had worked so hard to control. She threw her head back and gasped for air as she tried to
stop. She wrapped her arms around her stomach as another fit over took her when she looked
at the not too amused look on Gabrielle's face. &quot;I'm sorry...Gabrielle...I
just...couldn't...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I get it now,&quot; The bard moved to
the warrior and poked her in the chest. &quot;Gremlins &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt; are &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt;
like &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt; snipes &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt;!&quot;</p>

<p>Another fit of laughter erupted from the warrior
as she thought of Gabrielle's snipe hunting expedition from the spring. </p>
<i>

<p>The warrior had initially meant for it to be a
tracking lesson, but after a couple mugs of stiff ale and a little encouragement from
Autolycus the bard was in the middle of the forest with a sack waiting for the warrior and
the thief to flush out the snipes. </p>

<p>The warrior and the thief had of course returned
to the inn and had a couple more mugs of ale...<b>and a nice dinner</B>. It was only when
the innkeeper had started to stack the chairs for the night that the drunken duo decided
to go rescue the bard. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for them she found them first. She
was not a happy bard, not at all. She was limping ever so slightly and appeared to be
missing a boot, it was difficult to tell because of the mud caked on her legs from the
knees down. She still had the sack...</p>

<p>As they approached her on the road they tried
desperately to hide their intoxicated state, with little success. Their giggles pretty
much gave them away and if that didn't the odor certainly did.</p>

<p>&quot;So this is your idea of a joke huh
Xena.&quot; Gabrielle growled as she approached them. &quot;Not funny Xena. Not one damned
bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena tried to look apologetic, but with Autolycus
standing next to her giggling to himself it just wasn't possible. She just tried to hide
the grin on her face and nod her apology. It didn't go over well with the bard, who took
it as confirmation of her last statement.</p>

<p>As the bard began to rant they tried to regroup
and behave in an effort to soothe her. &quot;So tell me Xena what other childish things do
you enjoy doing to your best friend?&quot;</p>

<p>The things that flashed through the warrior's
mind at that moment weren't childish, as a matter of fact they were down right adult. </p>

<p>Xena's body had to release some of the energy
that had built up during the last few moments and a burst of air and laughter forced
itself from her lungs, which only served to coat the bard's right side in a fine mist of
spit. With this, both guilty parties were rolling with laughter again. Xena reached out a
tentative hand to dry the bard off.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm...sorry Gabrielle...&quot; She said
with a giggle.</p>

<p>Gabrielle slapped the offending hand away.
&quot;Don't touch me.&quot; She snatched a scarf that was hanging around the thief's neck
and wiped her arm off.</p>

<p>&quot;Heeyyy...&quot; He protested.
&quot;I...ha..had...to give good di..di..di..money for that!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; The warrior agreed.
&quot;Took...took himmmm...half...a can...candle...mark...to get her
att...atten...tion.&quot; she said with a grin and a nudge to the thief.</p>

<p>&quot;So basically while I've been out in the
middle of the cold, bug infested forest in mud up to my knees... missing my dinner and
holding your damned sack...you two have been at the tavern drinking and carousing with
barmaids.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Autolycus offered.
Before he realized what had happened, he found himself enveloped in total darkness as the
bard crammed the sack over his head and torso. To drunk to extract himself he fell to the
ground and wrestled with the bag with very little success.</p>

<p>Xena was about to offer him a hand when
Gabrielle's stare caught her. Like a deer trapped by a bright light, she couldn't move.
Even as her friend continued to struggle, the enraged bard held her full attention. She
sobered up pretty quickly. Never taking her eyes off Gabrielle she slowly reached down and
groped around until she found Autolycus and helped him up. She slid the bag off his head
and handed it to him with out a word. At this point he knew they were both in big trouble.</p>
</i>

<p>The realization of how her last joke had ended
almost made her want to stop this one. Almost, but not quite...</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle, honey relax.&quot; The warrior
pulled the bard into her arms. &quot;I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tease you.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle relaxed into the warrior and sighed.
&quot;You think it's funny don't you. That I'm that easy...&quot;</p>

<p>Xena placed her fingers over Gabrielle's mouth
and stopped the flow of words. &quot;Sweetheart I don't think of you as easy. Sometimes I
just like to have a little fun. I really am sorry. I won't do it anymore. I promise.&quot;
She placed a soft and gentle kiss on the bard's lips and the thoughts of gremlins were
gone from both minds.</p>

<p>As the evening became night they played with each
other as lovers do, touching slightly here, a gentle caress there, a soft kiss when the
other would least expect it. By the time they were ready for bed they had managed to
ignite fires for each other that just demanded to be put out.</p>

<p>Gabrielle slipped under the covers next to Xena.
Her naked form curling up next to the warrior's own nude body. &quot;Hmmmm,&quot; She
murmured. &quot;This feels so good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes it does.&quot; Xena agreed as she
pulled the bard on top of her and kissed her. Gabrielle's body wasted no time in becoming
one with the warrior's.</p>

<p>They made love. It was passionate. It was tender.
It was glorious. It was theirs and only theirs. They would happily share everything else
they had with the entire world if need be, but this belonged to them and only them. This
was when they became one with each other. As close to a whole as the two halves could be.</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhhhh Gods...Xena...&quot; Gabrielle
moaned into the night air as her body arched and crested from the powerful orgasm that
shook her entire being. She fell back into the bedroll as Xena rejoined her and took her
into her arms, holding her as close as her body would allow.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I forgiven?&quot; The warrior whispered
as Gabrielle's head came to rest in its usual spot on Xena's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Gods yes.&quot; The bard whispered
into the shoulder as she placed little kisses on the bare flesh.</p>

<p>Xena smiled as she felt the bard fall into a deep
slumber. She kissed her love on the forehead and fell gently with her.</p>
