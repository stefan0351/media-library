<!-- High School Hell \ Gym Class -->

<p>Pierce continued to dog Brooke for the next week. He was like a persistant personal Bible thumper; there at her locker when she got to school, waiting at her classes, everytime she turned around there he was. She did not enjoy the attention and neither did Sam. Pierce either ignored Sam or told her how she was evil and a demon sent from Hell to corrupt the pure and innocent soul of Brooke McQueen. Sam would have found it funny if the guy wasn't starting to scare her. </p>
<p>"So the principal said there was nothing he could do?" Nicole asked incredulous. </p>
<p>"Not unless Pierce actually does something," Brooke complained. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Did you say `Gee thanks, by then one of us might be dead'?" she asked. Pierce was getting increasingly hostile towards her lately and it was starting to worry her. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"They don't want to hear it, Sam," she said sadly.</p>
<p>"Remind me to sue from beyond the grave," Sam mumbled.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should tell your parents," Nic suggested. Both Brooke and Sam shook their heads. </p>
<p>"Our mess, our problem. We'll deal. This is a problem that we're going to encounter given our lifestyle," Sam pointed out. "We can't call in our parents to bail us out everytime it gets hairy." Brooke nodded her agreement. </p>
<p>"Besides, he's just a little religious friutcake. He'll get bored with us eventually and move on. What's the worse he's gonna do? Preach us to death?" she asked rhetorically. Nicole couldn't help but wonder if Brooke just baited the cosmic gods with that remark. </p>
<p><b>Two weeks later </b> </p>
<p>Only one other person witnessed what actually happened next other than the two people actually involved. But the cry of pure unadulterated agony that came out as nothing more as a sob caught Brooke's attention. It came from a voice that she knew better than she knew her own. She turned around in time to see Sam collapse to the field in a limp heap like a bag of boneless meat. And her heart stopped. </p>
<p>For one agonizing instant, her heart actually stopped and she felt her chest constrict painfully as she witnessed Sam lying there motionless on the grass. Her legs were all ready moving towards the prone figure and she fell to her knees beside her. For a second, she saw Sam as she did the night of the Prom, broken and bleeding on the asphalt. She shook her head to banish the image and spoke to the still figure. </p>
<p>"Sam? Sammy, can you hear me?" she asked, her voice cracking. Sam was curled up in a ball unmoving. Her eyes were fixed open and she was gasping for air like a fish stranded on land. She was shaking violently and low keening sounds were coming from the back of her throat. Other than that, she made no other sound or indication that she was aware that Brooke was even there. Brooke reached out and brushed Sam's cheek but the girl didn't even blink.</p>
<p>"Sam, Sam answer me," Brooke said a little stronger and more worried. Sam still didn't answer and Brooke felt the fear and panic within her grow and choke off her own air. She saw Lily out of the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>"Lily, what happened?" she asked, never taking her eyes or hand off of Sam. Lily kneeled down next to Sam and Brooke and shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know, one second we were playing and the next, she was lying there," Lily said confused. </p>
<p>"Yo, could someone give me a hand here?" Sugar Daddy yelled from a few feet away. He was attempting to pull an incredibly livid and vicious Nicole off of what appeared to be a classmate. Nicole was yelling incoherently and hissing, spitting and hitting, clawing, kicking, you name it. The classmate in question was curled up in the fetal position trying to survive the onslaught from the diminutive blonde. Josh went over and it still took him, Sugar and three others to pry Nicole off of the guy and hold her still. </p>
<p>"I'LL KILL YOU!" was the first coherent thing Nicole managed to say. </p>
<p>"Whoa, Nic, calm down before you have a stroke or something," Josh said. She turned on him, her eyes nearly red with fury. He took an unconscious step back. </p>
<p>"He hit her on purpose!" she panted angrily. "The little prick took his hockey stick and hit her in the back on purpose!" Upon hearing this, dread and utter fear filled Brooke making her nauseous. She turned back to Sam.</p>
<p>"Sammy, can you answer me?" Sam was still keening and shaking and didn't answer her. "Sam, I hate to ask this?Oh, God, can you feel your legs?" Sam's wails grew louder and Brooke felt tears start to fall down her cheeks. She looked up at Lily. </p>
<p>"Lily, hold her head while I look at her back. I have to see," she asked. Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"What's wrong, Brooke?" Lily asked as she gently placed her hands on either side of Sam's head. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"The doctor recently told Sam that she had to be careful with her back," Brooke explained sadly as she lifted the back of Sam's shirt to look at the place of impact. She winced when she saw the large spot in the middle of Sam's back that was all ready turning an ugly shade of red and purple. </p>
<p>"Then why was she playing gym?" Lily asked. Brooke sighed again as she continued to inspect the area gently as Sam sobbed. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Sammy," she apologized as one sob was particularly loud. "Because she's Sam," she answered Lily. "And as such, she thinks she's invulnerable." </p>
<p>"How is she, Brooke?" Nicole asked, calmer now and Sugar let go of her. The classmate attacker, none other than Pierce Shepard, was in no condition to go anywhere, so everyone ignored him for now and Carmen and Harrison were explaining everything to the teacher and calling for an ambulance.</p>
<p>"Bad, Nic. I don't think she can feel her legs," Brooke said, starting to cry harder as she stroked Sam's face and hair and waited for the ambulance. </p>
<p>"Jesus," Nicole whispered as she flopped to the ground beside the three. Lily looked at Pierce, who she noticed was actually unconscious and then back at Nicole. </p>
<p>"Nicole, what actually happened?" she asked. Nicole looked at her blankly for a second. </p>
<p>"I was sitting on the bench watching because, you know, I don't do Gym when I saw Sam turn her back on Pierce and start to walk away. The play or whatever was over so she was walking away when he raised his stick like this," she raised a nearby stick horizontally so that the butt was in Lily's face to demonstrate. "And pulled back before hitting her with the butt. She fell like a sack of bricks," Nic finished humorlessly. Lily let out a low whistle.</p>
<p>"No mistaking that for an accident," she said. Nicole shook her head. "And you flew off the bench and went all L.A.P.D. on him?" Nic shrugged. </p>
<p>"I guess so. I don't know I guess I just snapped. Guess I should get a refund on my anger management classes, huh?" she tried to joke. Lily smiled. </p>
<p>"It's cool." Just then the teacher arrived and demanded to know what happened to Pierce since she already knew what happened to Sam. </p>
<p>"I beat him up," Lily piped up before Nicole could open her mouth. Nicole stared at her in shock. Lily gave her a look that plainly said (shut up for once you twit) so Nic shut her mouth. Lily then repeated, almost word for word, what Nicole had said. The teacher nodded. </p>
<p>"Well, the police might have words to say to you but I wouldn't worry about it. Sounds like he deserved it. How is she, Brooke?" Brooke looked up from the girl she was guarding so closely. </p>
<p>"She won't answer me and I'm getting worried," Brooke answered. The teacher nodded sympathetically. </p>
<p>"It's shock, dear. Keep talking to her, I'm going to go show the ambulance in." After the teacher left, Nicole turned to Lily. </p>
<p>"What was THAT for?" she asked in complete shock. Lily had just pulled her proverbial fat out of the frying pan. Lily smiled. </p>
<p>"Nic, you're on probation for last spring's accident and after the way Sam exposed your family's ties to the judges and the way they bought you out of the drunk driving case, you would have gone away for assault or something for this. And as much as I still despise you at times, you were defending Sam and I couldn't let you get punished for that." Nic stared at her stupified.</p>
<p>"Th?thank you," she stuttered, stunned. </p>
<p>"Ambulance is here, Brooke," Harrison spoke up. Brooke nodded and stood out of the way as the paramedics loaded Sam up. It was a strange parody of Prom night. Again Brooke climbed into the back of the bus and grabbed Sam's limp hand. </p>
<p>"Hang on, Sammy, I'm here for you," she whispered as the door closed and the bus pulled away. </p>
