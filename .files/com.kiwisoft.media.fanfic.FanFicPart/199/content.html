<!-- Talking In Your Sleep \ Story -->

<p align=center><i>When you close your eyes and you fall asleep.<br>
And it’s down to the sound of a heart beat.<br>
I can hear the things that you’re dreaming about.<br>
When you open up your heart and the truth comes out.<br>
Hall and Oates</i></p>

<p>The early morning hours were a quiet, reflective time for Buffy. She loved
to lay awake in bed, not making a sound, as she held Willow in her arms and
thought about the changes that had recently come into her life. It sometimes
made her head swim when she thought how fast things had really changed. Her
relationship with Willow had seemed to grow deeper and stronger almost over
night, although it had actually deepened this way over the years that they
had known each other. Every time she had saved Willow, and vice versa, every
time they had shared a secret or a shared hurt the bond had grown. It had
just taken one night, and one spell, to make them both realize that they
felt the exact same way for each other.</p>

<p>The thought of the child that was developing inside of her best friend and
lover filled the Slayer with a feeling of such elation that she couldn’t
imagine being any happier. She knew that Willow would make a great Mom,
there wasn’t a doubt in her mind about that. What her place in this whole
thing was, Buffy didn’t quite know yet. She remembered the things her father
had done with her when she was little. Taking her to the park. Buying her
ice cream. Teaching her to ice skate. Buffy looked forward to showing her
daughter all of these things, and so much more.
Buffy snuggled her face into Willow’s hair as she thought, relishing the
peace and quiet, and the soft curves of her lover. This was shattered by a
sudden rap at their dorm room door.</p>

<p>Buffy opened one eye and sent a scorching look over at the door as if she
could will the person away by the shear force of it. Instead, another rap
sounded, followed by the sound of Xander’s voice. "Hey Buff...Will...are you
guys decent?"</p>

<p>"Not really." Buffy grumbled, before she cast a quick look at the clock on
Willow’s bedside table. "Eight o’clock. Just great Xander. I thought you
slept in on Saturday mornings. Or watched cartoons or something." Being
careful not to disturb her sleeping lover, Buffy eased out of bed and threw
a bath robe on over her nakedness. She tip-toed over to the door and opened
it a crack, seeing Xander staring back intently at her.
"Where’s Will?" Xander asked crossly, trying to brush his way past the
Slayer and into the room.</p>

<p>Buffy however, stood firm, not letting Xander through. "She’s sleeping,
Xander. We both were. It’s eight o’clock in the morning. What are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had a fight with my old man about Anya and...well actually, my
mother found Anya and me having sex, but she walked in without even
knocking. What did she expect? And then she threw Anya out of the house! So,
I said, I should be able to have whoever I want in my own apartment, and
then my dad said ‘As long as you are under my roof", yadda, yadda, yadda. So
I left, and I was wondering if I could stay here with you guys." Xander
finished, staring pleadingly at the Slayer.</p>

<p>‘This is so not my problem.’ Buffy thought to herself, her arms crossed over
her chest as she looked Xander up and down. She was half tempted to slam the
door in his face, but the pleading puppy eyed look finally broke through her
defenses, and she sighed disgustedly at herself. "Well, you can’t stay here,
Xander. But, why don’t you come in and cool off for a little while. Just
keep it down, Willow’s still asleep." Buffy said, opening the door for
Xander to enter.</p>

<p>Xander smiled his thanks at Buffy, then stepped quietly into the room. He
saw Willow sleeping in her bed. She was laying on her side, the covers
tucked up under her chin, one arm was curled around her pillow. He sat down
on Buffy’s bed, which was already made, and asked if he could turn on the TV
It struck him odd that Buffy’s bed was already made, while Buffy looked like
she had just gotten out of bed. He didn’t think Buffy would have made her
bed before answering the door, but anything was possible, he supposed.</p>

<p>"Sure. Just keep it down. I don’t want Willow to wake up." Buffy said, going
into her closet to get dressed.</p>

<p>Xander turned on the TV and quickly found some cartoons to take his mind off
the argument he had with his parents. He was just getting into the cartoon,
enjoying watching Speedy Gonzales race past the stoopid cat with the cheese
when he heard Willow giggling.</p>

<p>"Yeah...Speedy’s always been my favorite." Xander agreed, looking over at
Willow and smiling, before he noticed that Willow was still asleep. "Huh?"
Xander said, confused. Buffy came out of the closet, fully dressed when she
heard Xander talking to himself.</p>

<p>"Xander, shh." Buffy warned, glancing a look to Willow to see if she was
still asleep.</p>

<p>"Does she do that often?" Xander asked, grinning a little. He found it
amusing that Willow giggled in her sleep.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked, unsure what he was talking about.</p>

<p>"Laugh in her sleep." Xander clarified.</p>

<p>"I’ve never heard her laugh." Buffy said, shooting a soft look at her lover.
"She sometimes talks in her sleep, though."</p>

<p>Xander found it strange that he had never heard Willow talk in her sleep
before. They had been best friends all their lives...but then they had never
been room mates, either. On the few occasions where they had actually slept
at each other’s house when they were little, Willow had been silent as a
mouse.</p>

<p>Buffy and Xander waited in silence for a few minutes to see if Willow would
laugh again, but when several moments went by, they figured Willow had
stopped for the time being. Xander turned his attention back to the
cartoons, and Buffy went over to her mirror to brush her hair. That was when
they heard Willow giggle again.</p>

<p>"Buffy." Willow said, giggling in her sleep, unaware of the curiosity it was
striking in Xander.</p>

<p>Buffy blushed as Xander looked from Willow to Buffy then back again. Buffy
shrugged, pretending nonchalance as she tried to get Xander’s attention back
to the television.</p>

<p>They sat in an uncomfortable silence for a few seconds, before Willow’s
tattling mouth got away from her again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Buffy." Willow moaned, and there was no denying what kind of moan it
was.</p>

<p>Xander noticed the definitely sensual undertones in Willow’s voice, and
stared in shock at Buffy. Buffy blushed scarlet, before she met Xander’s
stare head on. "I’ll bet you’re wondering what’s going on." Buffy said,
watching Xander’s head bobble in an affirmative gesture.</p>

<p>"Well, why don’t you let me wake up Willow, and then we’ll explain
everything to you, okay?" Buffy asked. She didn’t want to have to do this by
herself, especially since it was Willow who had given everything away,
without meaning to, of course.</p>

<p>Xander nodded again, the pieces starting to fit in his brain. The way
Buffy’s bed had already been made, when Buffy had clearly still been in bed
when he had knocked on the door.</p>

<p>Buffy went over to Willow’s bed and sat on it gently. Feeling self-conscious
as she felt Xander’s curious stare burning into her back, she prodded her
lover with one hand. "Will, wake up." Buffy murmured, trying to wake her up
as gently as possible.</p>

<p>Willow responded by giggling in her sleep and rolling onto her back. "Not
the belly button." Willow said, still giggling. It was all Buffy could do
not to start laughing at the absurdity of the situation. Feeling the grin
taking it’s place on her face, she was unable to resist leaning down and
kissing Willow lightly on the cheek. She felt eyelashes flutter against her
cheek, and nuzzled her nose against Willow’s soft skin, forgetting for the
moment Xander’s presence.</p>

<p>"Mmm...Buffy?" Willow murmured sleepily, as she leaned her cheek into the
nuzzle.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at the sleepy tone, before she remembered the audience that was
probably gawking at them at that moment. "Xander’s here." Buffy whispered
into her lover’s ear, feeling her stiffen briefly.</p>

<p>Willow wondered fuzzily why Buffy was kissing her when Xander was probably
watching, then decided it didn’t really matter since he had to find out
eventually.</p>

<p>They lay there like that for a little while, until Buffy sensed Xander’
increasing awkwardness and urged Willow up into a sitting position then
scooted in behind her and pulled her back to rest against her.</p>

<p>If Xander couldn’t guess from evidence before what was going on between his
two best friends, there wasn’t any doubt in his mind now.</p>

<p>"You two umm...for want of a better phrase...orgasm friends now?" Xander
asked, taking in the positions his friends had chosen to sit in.</p>

<p>Buffy winced at the turn of phrase. "There’s gotta be a better way to say
that." Buffy muttered, feeling Willow’s silent laughter shake her.</p>

<p>"So it’s true then." Xander hedged, not quite sure how he felt about the
whole thing. Upon seeing twin nods, he felt a wave of emotion go through him
that left him feeling slightly nauseous. It was a strange combination of
shock, betrayal, hurt and confusion that left him feeling out of place.</p>

<p>He had dreamed of being with Buffy all through high school, and although he
had dated other girls, he was always left with a feeling that he was doing
it more as a substitution for Buffy than as any real feeling he had for the
girls. As for Willow, she was his best friend. She had been since they had
played in the sand box together and although times had changed, and he had
even swapped some smoochies with her, he still tended to see her as the
twelve year old girl who had cried on his shoulder ever time Cordelia chase
had put down her fashion sense.
He wondered how all of this had come about, when had things changed, and why
he hadn’t seen any of this coming. He felt as if the two of them were
suddenly traveling on a road that he wasn’t allowed on, and he had never
felt more alone in his life.</p>

<p>"Oh." He said finally, trying hard not to let his emotions show.
Buffy and Willow waited for the news to sink in and Xander to come back from
the place he disappeared to, before looking at each other and silently
debating who was going to tell him the next bit of news. Willow hoped he
took the news well. He sometimes had the tendency to overreact.</p>

<p>"There’s more." Buffy said finally, rubbing Willow’s stomach
unconsciously where their joined hands had rested.</p>

<p>"More? How much more?" Xander asked, nervously, not sure how much more he
could take.</p>

<p>Willow grinned at Xander in her own quiet way, while Buffy’s grin was like
that of a tiger pouncing on her prey. "How do you feel about being an Uncle,
Xander?" Buffy asked him, her chin resting lightly on the red head’s
shoulder. She watched in amusement as Xander’s mouth dropped open in shock.</p>

<p>He opened and shut his mouth several times, looking like a fish out of
water, as he tried to get words to form in his stir-fried brain. "HUH?!"
Xander finally managed to say, rather loudly, feeling like all of his blood
was rushing to his head. "Wh-What?! How?! I mean...you don’t look
pregnant...not that I expect you to look fat or anything...either of
you...Not that there’s anything wrong with that." Xander spluttered. He had
somehow managed to rise to his feet, though he didn’t know how, since his
knees felt like jello.</p>

<p>"If you’ll pause for breath for a second Xand, I’ll be glad to tell you."
Buffy said, humor tingeing her voice. Buffy related the story from beginning
to end, then did it twice more before the light of comprehension filled
Xander’s eyes.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe it." Xander finally muttered out loud, shaking his head in
absolute refusal.</p>

<p>"I don’t know how to make it any more clear for you Xander. You’re just
going to have to accept the fact that Willow and I are having a baby." Buffy
sighed in frustration at her thick headed friend.</p>

<p>Xander shook his head, disbelief still prevalent on his face. The whole
situation just seemed to ludicrous to him, even though he did live on top of
a hell mouth. "I’m sorry...I just...can’t. Maybe if I take a walk, clear my
head." Xander said, right before he just about sprinted for the door.</p>

<p>"Xander!" Willow cried out, distressed at the abrupt departure of her best
male pal.</p>

<p>"Shh." Buffy soothed, pulling Willow back into her embrace. "He’ll be back.
You know Xander, once he’s had a chance to let everything sink in he’ll come
around."</p>

<p>"You think?" Willow asked, not sounding all too sure. "I’ve lost my
parent’s. I don’t want to lose Xander too." She said, her lip quivering.</p>

<p>"He’ll come back. Give him a few hours and he’ll be all ready to be Uncle
Xander." Buffy reassured her lover. "And while we wait..." Buffy said, her
tone turning seductive as she started sniffing and nipping at her lover’s
neck. "Why don’t you show me what you were dreaming about that got us in
such trouble." Buffy teased, gently nudging them so they lay flat on the
bed.</p>

<p>"Buffy..." Willow protested half-heartedly, already losing her will to fight
as Buffy nipped down her through and kissed the hollow of her throat,
licking it teasingly. "Oh, what the heck." Willow shrugged off her concern
and let her lover take care of her other needs.
True to Buffy’s prediction, they heard a knock at their dorm room door a
couple of hour’s later. When Buffy opened the door, a bathrobe firmly in
place over her naked body, a very sheepish Xander stood in the doorway. He
held something behind his back that he tried hard not to let Buffy see.</p>

<p>"Can I come in?" Xander asked, looking past Buffy to Willow who was still
lying curled up under the covers in her bed. Buffy followed his look to
Willow and arched an eyebrow, looking to her for guidance. Willow nodded and
Buffy let Xander in. He walked directly over to Willow and handed her a
giant, over-stuffed panda bear. "For the baby." Xander said sheepishly,
awkwardly kicking the top of his sneaker into their plush carpet.
"Oooh Xander! A panda!" Willow exclaimed, hugging the giant bear, before
sending Xander a bright grin. "Thank you." She said, sincerely.</p>

<p>Xander shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably. "It was the least I could do
for the way I acted this morning. I was a jerk, and I wanted to make it up
to you."</p>

<p>"Well, I’ll tell you one way you can make it up to us." Buffy said, making
her way to her lover’s side and sitting down beside her. She smiled slyly at
Willow, then stared into Xander’s soulful brown eyes.</p>

<p>Seeing his chance to get back into their good graces, he jumped at the
opportunity. "What? I’ll do anything." Xander vowed, solemnly.</p>

<p>Blue eyes twinkled at him, as Buffy answered. "Help us move?"</p>

<p>Brown eyes went over the room quickly, before an unsure smile lit up
Xander’s face. "Sure." He gulped, wondering just how much work this was
going to be.</p>

<p>Blue and green eyes met over a stuffed panda bear and smiled at each other.</p>
