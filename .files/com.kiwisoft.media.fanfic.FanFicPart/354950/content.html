<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 20: Bite -->

<p>Two days later they felt no closer to their destination. The
		dusty ruts in the ground led endlessly into the distance, slicing the landscape in two.
		Only the occasional brush or collection of rocks gave them any indication of progress. The
		excessive heat had not dissipated, forcing both the women and the horses to use more water
		than they had planned. Josie took pains to take only minimal amounts for herself, knowing
		that they were still a distance away from the nearest watering hole. Rebecca was aware of
		the bounty hunter's reluctance to take any water for herself and decided to limit her own
		use, an action that was not lost on Josie.</p>

		<p>The reds and oranges of sunset filled the horizon. Josie led the
		wagon off the trail and to a small outcropping of brush and rocks. They fed and cared for
		the horses, the younger woman mimicking every move the bounty hunter made. Once Flossy and
		Phoenix were settled, they set about getting their camp set up. Although several pounds of
		oats had been used, the idea of hefting the sack out of the wagon every night and back in
		the morning was unappealing to Josie. So as they had been doing, they set their bedrolls
		on opposite sides of the fire. The gunslinger set about getting the fire going while
		Rebecca gathered the items from the wagon that they would need for the night. As the deep
		red ball of fire disappeared over the horizon and the dark gray of twilight settled in,
		all the gear was set up for the evening. A small pot of coffee was warming in the fire;
		the only luxury Josie allowed herself. "I'm going to go look around," Rebecca
		said as she stood up. "I won't go far."</p>

		<p>Josie nodded and went back to cleaning her gun. As the young
		blonde left her sight, she said softly, "Be careful," before returning to her
		task.</p>

		<p>Rebecca wove her way through the pillars of stone, mentally
		making note of the twists and turns so she could find her way back. The moon was not yet
		high enough in the sky to cast any illumination to the area. As her thigh grazed the thin
		branches of a small brush, she heard the unmistakable rattle. Fear gripped her now racing
		heart and all thoughts of direction left her mind. She took a small step backward and
		heard it again, this time even closer than before. In the very dim light her eyes were
		unable to pinpoint the location of the deadly snakes. Whether it was her eyes playing
		tricks on her or a real snake moving closer, she never knew. Rebecca let out a loud shriek
		and turned to run away. Frightened and disoriented, she tripped over the same brush that
		she had scraped against before and landed too close for the rattler's comfort. It struck
		with blinding speed, sinking it's curved fangs deep into the back of her left calf before
		slithering back and coiling up in a defensive posture.</p>

		<p>Before the scream had died, Josie was racing toward her, shotgun
		in hand. "Rebecca!" she called as she made her way through the darkness, bumping
		into the stone pillars of granite in her haste.</p>

		<p>"Josie? Josie!" Rebecca cried, her eyes wide as she
		tried to see any more snakes. Paralyzed by fear, she was unable to move.
		"Josie!" she cried again, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca!" She stopped just short of stepping on the
		young blonde as her keen eyes made out her form on the ground.</p>

		<p>"S-ssnakes." Tears rolled freely down Rebecca's face as
		she felt the burning pain in her leg. Her protector's presence gave her the strength she
		needed to move. She turned and wrapped her arms tight around the gunslinger's leg. Josie
		picked out three snakes coiled up in the darkness. All seemed to be a safe enough distance
		away. She set the Winchester down on the ground and turned her attention to the terrified
		Rebecca.</p>

		<p>With a firm grip, she extricated the frightened woman from her
		leg. "Were you bit?"</p>

		<p>"Y-yesss," she bawled as she reached for her lower leg.
		Josie released her grip long enough to remove her bandanna and tear it in half. She
		quickly tied one piece just below Rebecca's knee and the other right above the ankle. The
		gunslinger scooped her up and raced back to camp.</p>

		<p>Josie knew that time was of the essence as she set her wounded
		charge down on the blanket and pulled a knife out of her boot. She rolled Rebecca onto her
		stomach and cut the pant leg open, exposing two angry looking puncture marks against the
		creamy white skin. "This will hurt," she said, unsure if the young woman heard
		her over her sobbing. Already the affected area was puffing up. After a quick check to
		make sure the restricting bands of cloth weren't so tight that they cut off circulation,
		she placed the blade against Rebecca's skin and made quick incisions across both wounds.
		The young woman's cries and screams were enough to wake the dead as she tried to pull her
		leg away. Josie's powerful arms held her down forcefully. "Rebecca, we don't have
		time for you to be fighting with me. You need to calm down." She contemplated cold
		cocking the young woman, but the hysterical sobs gave way to sniffles. "Concentrate
		on your breathing. Take deep, slow breaths." Her long fingers worked to squeeze out
		as much blood and venom as possible. Rebecca buried her face in her hands and let out a
		series of ragged sobs. Josie stretched her body out along the ground, bringing her mouth
		closer to the bloodied leg. "I have to suck the poison out."</p>

		<p>"No!" the young woman wailed, but she was powerless to
		stop her. A burning sensation was moving up her leg to her thigh and more panic set in.
		She felt the pressure of Josie's mouth against her calf, then a strong sucking feeling.
		The gunslinger drew as much of the fluid into her mouth as she could, lifted and turned
		her head, then spit it out before repeating the process. The vile taste made her stomach
		turn but she refused to let it impede her progress. Already the fluid was changing from a
		watery substance mixed with blood to mostly blood, but she knew that the first fifteen
		minutes were all there was to remove the venom. After that, they would just have to wait
		for the remainder to run its course. Josie sucked as hard as she could, her ears tuning
		out the wails and cries of her companion. When all she could taste was the blood, the
		gunslinger stopped sucking and reached for the saddlebag. Rebecca was still crying but had
		stopped the hysterical sobs. Josie removed a small roll of cloth from the saddlebag and
		wrapped the wound securely.</p>

		<p>"Roll over," she said as she rose and headed for the
		wagon. She pulled out Phoenix's saddle and returned to Rebecca's side. "I'm going to
		put this under your leg. It's important to keep it elevated." The dim firelight
		allowed the bounty hunter to see her nod in understanding. Josie placed the saddle under
		her leg then covered her with the blanket, tucking it in around the young woman to keep
		her warm and to hopefully stave off shock.</p>

		<p>The bounty hunter kept vigil all night over her, changing the
		bandage frequently. She grimly noted that the soaked bandage still showed traces of
		yellow, indicating that she hadn't gotten all of the venom out. The fangs had penetrated
		deeper than she had thought. There was nothing Josie could do now but wait and let the
		snake bite run its course. She knew that no matter how deep the wound, it was not life
		threatening. It would be painful, however, and most likely would swell up for a time
		before it got better. Rebecca stirred several times, but slept through the night.</p>

		<p>She woke up to the smells of coffee brewing and meat sizzling on
		the fire. Josie was sitting next to her, mug in hand. "Morning, sprite. How's the leg
		feel?" the gunslinger said as she took a sip of coffee, trying hard not to grimace.</p>

		<p>"It burns and my skin feels...tight."</p>

		<p>"It's swelling. You'll have to keep it up until the swelling
		goes down." She poured Rebecca a cup of the strong liquid and handed it to her. The
		young woman propped herself up on one elbow and gratefully accepted the coffee. She took a
		sip, crinkled her face, and looked at Josie.</p>

		<p>"How much coffee did you use? This stuff is really
		strong."</p>

		<p>"It is, isn't it?" the gunslinger responded as she
		looked down at the blackness in her mug. "Well, since you do it so well, you can be
		in charge of making the coffee from now on." She set her mug down on the ground and
		stood up. "I'll be back in a minute. Stay here."</p>

		<p>Rebecca forced herself to drink the vile coffee while she waited
		for the bounty hunter to return. Three shots rang out, breaking the silence of the
		morning. Josie returned moments later with her shotgun and three lifeless snakes in her
		hand. The sight of the rattlers, even dead, was enough to start the young woman's heart
		racing. Josie saw the panicked expression and tossed the snakes on the far side of the
		fire. "Dinner," she said simply. Rebecca nodded, her eyes never leaving the pile
		of serpents. With a sense of pride, the bounty hunter pulled out her knife and began to
		skin and clean the snakes. She didn't know which one had bitten her friend, but it didn't
		matter now. All three would make a fine stew. "We won't be moving on until your leg
		looks a little better."</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded, grateful for the chance to rest. The rock
		formations helped to provide some shade from the burning sun and she settled back to rest
		for a while longer, daydreaming of a valiant knight slaying dragons to protect a princess.
		Josie piled the chunks of meat into the cooking pot and leaned against the wagon, using a
		wheel to support her back while she started to clean her guns, a chore all but forgotten
		in last night's excitement.</p>

		<p>By nightfall, the swelling had diminished enough for Rebecca to
		move about and make supper. Although the gunslinger seemed to enjoy the stew, the young
		woman found herself unable to eat it; the memory of being bitten was just too strong. She
		contented herself with some warmed over jerky washed down with ale. Despite her dislike
		for the taste, she worried about the effect the extra day would have on their still
		dwindling water supply.</p>

		<p>After dinner, Josie changed the bandage on Rebecca's leg and saw
		that the wound was no longer oozing anything but blood. The long night of watching over
		the young woman caught up with her and the bounty hunter settled into bed early, leaving
		Rebecca alone with her thoughts. She noted that not one unkind word had been said about
		her getting bitten, even though she knew that if she had just remained calm, it never
		would have happened. She vowed to make the effort to get over her fear of snakes.</p>
