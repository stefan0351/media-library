<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 21: Graduation - Part 1-->

<p>Cordelia, Buffy, and Willow were sitting on one of the couches at the Bronze. They were looking all around the building. The stage, the bar, they were trying to memorize every inch of the place. This was probably going to be their last time in the club.</P>
<p>"I feel like we should be taking Polaroids." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Especially you, because you're leaving and all." Willow said. "And for us to come here would be a long walk. Cause of the absence of a car."</P>
<p>"No I meant cause it's probably gonna be demolished. Not that I don't think…"</P>
<p>"It's okay, Cordy. I know what you mean. Doesn't look too hopeful." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"I'm sensing a lot of negative energy, and I don't like it." Willow said trying to pull them out of their thoughts.</P>
<p>"Can you blame us?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"I don't even think I'm gonna go to graduation."</P>
<p>"Not go?" Willow was speechless.</P>
<P>"Ascension. Mayor becoming a demon. Snacking up on populace. I was planning on fighting him. Remember? And you might want to get out why you have the chance, Cordelia."</P>
<P>"Hey I may not be able to make much of a difference, but I'm gonna stay till it's over. Besides if you die, I won't have anyone to call and brag to about my movie success."  </P>
<P>Buffy and Willow smiled at her, as Xander walked over. Cordelia stared at him for a minute, and then looked at her friends apologetically. She got up and walked away.</P>
<P>"So, what were you talking about?" Xander asked quietly.</P>
<P>"Nothing to do with you Xander, but maybe we should have been." Willow said angry. She was still mad at him for what he did. She knew he could be a jerk, but he had crossed the line this time.</P>
<P>"What we were talking about," Buffy said matching Willow's tone, "was graduation and fighting the Mayor."</P>
<P>"The Mayor? What, you guys didn't hear?"</P>
<P>"Hear what?"</P>
<P>"Guess who our commencement speaker is."</P>
<P>Their faces went from sad to sullen in less than a second.</P>
<P>"Siegfried?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Roy?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"One of the tigers?"</P>
<P>"Come out of the fantasy, Will."</P>
<P>She glared at him. How dare he shut her up because she was upset. </P>
<I><P>'Can I hit him?'</P>
<P>'It'll be okay, Will. I swear.'</P>
</I><P>"I don't believe this." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Lends credence to my whole "I'm gonna die" theorem, doesn't it?"</P>
<P>"The Mayor at graduation? A hundred helpless kids to feed on. Got any other surprises for us?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>The Mayor got Faith an expensive and very luxurious apartment on the better side of town. Almost like a suite, it had a large half oval-shaped window, a plush purple bed, art statues, a coffee table, kitchen, and stereo system.</P>
<P>He was tidying up the main room, and Faith was in one off to the side.  </P>
<P>"And everything went smoothly with Mr. Wirth?" He asked.</P>
<P>"Not if you're Mr. Wirth."</P>
<P>He giggled. "Well, that's swell. You know how I feel about loose ends. And the big day is so close; you can smell the excitement in the air. Say, are you ever coming out of there?"</P>
<P>"I don't know."</P>
<P>"Aw, come on."</P>
<P>Faith entered in a pink and white dress, barefoot, and somewhat shy.</P>
<P>"Wow, aren't you a vision."</P>
<P>"I feel wicked stupid in this."</P>
<P>"You look lovely. Perfect for the Ascension. Any boys that manage to survive will be lining up to ask you out."</P>
<P>"It just isn't me, though."</P>
<P>"Not you? Let me tell you something. Nobody knows what you are. Not even you, little Miss Seen-it-all. The Ascension isn't just my day. It's yours too. Your day to blossom, to show the world what a powerful girl you are. I think of what you've done, what I know you will do," he caressed her face, "no father could be prouder."</P>
<P>"I hope I don't let you down."</P>
<p>"Impossible. Now come on, change back into your street clothes. I'll buy you an Icee."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Willow were in her room. Willow was lying on the floor staring intently at her laptop. Buffy was slipping on a gray long sleeved shirt walking around the room, trying to tie back her hair.</P>
<p>"So, you told you're parents to split, huh?" She asked Willow.</P>
<p>"Uh huh." Came the monotone reply.</P>
<p>"How'd they take it?"</P>
<p>"Well, I handed them their suitcases and made them go. I just didn't want them here when…"</P>
<p>"That was the right thing to do. I should tell mom to go too."</P>
<p>"You sure she didn't mind me over here last night?"</P>
<p>"No way. Hey, you almost done? It's almost time for school."</P>
<p>"Yeah, I just want to see…why are you in a rush to learn all of the sudden?"</P>
<p>"Learn? What's that?" She smiled. "No, I found something in the newspaper. I want Giles to take a look at it."</P>
<p>Willow slammed the monitor down on top of the base of the computer.</P>
<p>"I'll never find a spell to stop the Ascension." Willow said in frustration.</P>
<p>Buffy knelt down beside her. "Hey," she said softly, "we'll figure something out. Okay?" </P>
<P>She brushed her hand over Willow's hair, and kissed her reassuringly.</P>
<p>"Let's go find out how to kick some demonic mayoral ass." Willow said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the library, Giles and Wesley were fencing. Buffy stood to the side, holding up a newspaper that read: PROFESSOR FOUND MURDERED. Willow, Oz, and Xander were sitting at the table.</P>
<P>"Faith." </P>
<P>"You sure?" Giles asked.</P>
<P>"One of her pieces. I recognize the brush work."</P>
<P>Giles took the paper and held it in one hand, reading while parrying Wesley's light attacks.</P>
<P>"Brutally stabbed. Mr. Wirth, visiting professor of geology. There's nothing in here that bellows motive."</P>
<P>"Random killing, perhaps? Fit of rage? Everybody does seem to be going a bit mad, lately. Faith has something of a head start." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"Doesn't read. I think its homework." Buffy said.</P>
<P>Giles stopped sparring. "The Mayor wanted the good professor out of the way."</P>
<P>"Which leads to the question, how come? I'm gonna destroy the entire city, but I take the time to kill harmless Lester first?"</P>
<P>"Tying up loose ends?"</P>
<P>"What could an old geologist have to do with the Hellmouth?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"The same way a happy go lucky ordinary Clark Kent type Mayor has something to do with it." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Lester had something or knew something." Giles said.</P>
<P>"Then I wanna know too. The Mayor's trying to hide. I say we go seek." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Ah. By attempting to keep a valuable clue from us, the Mayor may have inadvertently led us right to it."</P>
<P>"What page are you on, Wes? 'Cause we already got there."</P>
<p>"We're several pages ahead actually." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Yes, well. You will go tonight. Look over his apartment. Anything of note, report back here."</P>
<P>"I just love it when you take charge, you man, you." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Uh...was that a yes? I have trouble keeping track."</P>
<P>"I'll go."</P>
<P>"Be careful. If Faith should show up," Giles said.</P>
<P>"I don't think she'll show. Been there, killed that. She's not much for follow-up."</P>
<P>"Nonetheless, keep watch. Faith has you at a disadvantage, Buffy."</P>
<P>"Cause I'm not crazy or cause I don't kill people?"</P>
<P>"Both, actually."</P>
<P>"I hear you. I can't kill her, fun as it may sound. I can make her cry uncle, though, and I mean to."</P>
<P>"Don't let your feelings about Faith interfere with your work." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"Stopping Faith is my work. Take a beat to love the synergy."</P>
<P>"Faith is a footnote. Our priority is stopping the Ascension."</P>
<p>"I vote for giving Faith a smack or two." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Oh don't worry. She'll get more then a smack." Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Outside of the school, the Mayor and Snyder were walking through the rows of chairs set up for graduation. A sign was hung over a stage that held a podium that said, SUNNYDALE CLASS OF '99.</P>
<p>"Kids are here. Parents off to the side there. We'll go up, they'll play the processional, and then you'll give the address." Snyder said.</P>
<P>"It all looks wonderful."</P>
<P>"As long as nobody makes any trouble."</P>
<P>"Oh, stop worrying. You just make sure the kids show up. Anybody who doesn't feel like coming to graduation, well, they'll just have to live without a diploma."</P>
<P>"They'll be here, sir."</P>
<P>"Call me Richard. You've done a great job here. I know things are, well, different here in Sunnydale. We've both seen all sorts of things. What's important is that we keep it under control, and that's what you've done."</P>
<P>"I believe in order."</P>
<P>"Sunnydale owes you a debt. It will be repaid. Yessir, we'll mark that invoice paid in full."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Back in the library, they were looking over the pages from the books of Ascension that Willow had stole. </P>
<P>"None of these demons seem better than the others." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"You know maybe we'll get lucky and one of the demons will be allergic to something." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Like people."</P>
<P>"I'm afraid that -" Giles started, but stopped short as the Mayor casually strolled into the library, and ran his hand over the check out counter.</P>
<P>Everyone quickly huddled close together, and Buffy hid the newspaper and pages. Giles stood up, stone-faced.</P>
<P>"So, this is the inner sanctum. Faith tells me this is where you folks like to hang out. Concoct your little schemes. I tell you, it's just nice to see that some young people are still interested in reading in this modern era. So, what are kids reading nowadays?"</P>
<P>The Mayor walked to the table and picked up an open book. </P>
<P>" 'The beast will walk upon the earth and darkness will follow. The several races of man will be as one in their terror and destruction.' Aw, that's kind of sweet. Different races coming together?"</P>
<P>"You never get even a little tired of hearing yourself speak, do you?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>The Mayor went and stood toe to toe with Giles. "That's one spunky little girl you've raised. I'm gonna eat her."</P>
<p>Without thinking, Giles grabbed Wesley's sword from the table and thrust it through the Mayor's chest. The Mayor staggered back but regained his balance.</P>
<P>"Whoa! Well now, that was a little thoughtless." He pulled the sword out. It was covered in blood. "Violent outbursts like that, in front of the children? You know, Mr. Giles, they look to you to see how to behave."</P>
<P>"Get out." Buffy said.</P>
<P>The Mayor took out his handkerchief and slowly wiped the blood from the sword.</P>
<P>"I smell fear. That's smart. Some of your deaths will be quick, if that's worth anything. Well, see you all at graduation." He tossed Giles the sword. "You don't want to miss my commencement address. It's going to be one heck of a speech."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Later, at night, Buffy and Willow walked into Lester Wirth's apartment. They went immediately to the boxes on the table.</P>
<P>"You sure you want to be here?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah. After the Mayor…I kinda don't wanna be alone right now."</P>
<P>"I know we're getting close to showdown, and I know what you're thinking. I won't let Faith…do anything to you."</P>
<P>Willow smiled. "I know."</P>
<P>"Can you make any sense of this?"</P>
<P>Buffy shuffled through a notebook, and handed it to Willow.</P>
<P>"Geology isn't my strong point, but there's lots of references to lava beds and stuff."</P>
<P>"Well, let's get this stuff back to the library."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Faith slipped into the library through the cellar behind the stacks. The idiots that were watching from the outside were right. There was nobody in here, but she'd have to make it quick.</P>
<P>She walked over to Giles' office door. It was shut, but unlocked. Faith thought that was kind of idiotic to not lock the door, but even if it was, she could've broken it anyway. She could hear the tea maker, and see the freshly made tea sitting in the pot.</P>
<I><P>'Perfect.'</P>
</I><P>She took a vial out of her jacket, and popped off the lid. She thought about adding just a few drops of its contents into the pot, but quickly dumped the entire thing out. She smiled, and turned to leave. She heard faint footsteps.</P>
<P>She quickly ran up the steps and waited in the cellar. The footsteps belonged to Wesley, who went immediately to his forgotten briefcase on the table. He noticed the open office door, and looked perplexed for a moment.</P>
<I><P>'Damn.'</P>
</I><P>Shaking it off, he simply went over and shut it, and then left the library. Faith grinned and made her way out. Giles car was still in the lot. He was coming back soon to spend the rest of the night researching.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Oz and Xander came into the library behind Giles carrying a stack of books.</P>
<P>"We're bringing more books into an already book-infested library. Go figure." Xander said.</P>
<P>"These are from a contact in London. Whether these volumes will be of use…" Giles trailed off.</P>
<P>"Hey, I'm about to look for a way to stop the Ascension by praying to Elvis. Anything's worth a shot." Oz reassured.</P>
<P>"Yeah the King seemed to have all the answers." Xander said.</P>
<P>"Not to mention all the weight." Oz said.</P>
<P>They set the books down on the table.</P>
<P>"I think the tea is just about ready. Excuse me." Giles said.</P>
<P>"You know, one day they're gonna find something wrong with tea. Like it causes hemophilia or the tendency to influence marriage between cousins. If you really think about it, all Englishmen are equivalent to American hicks." Xander stated.</P>
<P>"Right down to the bad dental hygiene." Oz said.  </P>
<p>Giles walked into the office trying to shake off the sudden headache that had occurred in the last five seconds. He poured himself a cup, and took a light sip. Immediately, he felt soothed. He walked back to the table.</P>
<p>"I wish I had more time to defend my honor and my country, but I don't. So if you two are quite finished -"</P>
<p>He stopped talking suddenly, and his legs gave out. He felt sharp stabbing pains all over his body. He fell, and Xander and Oz immediately got up.</P>
<p>"Oh God, I was just kidding, Giles…" Xander said. Oz rushed to the phone and dialed 911. "What happened?"</P>
<p>"Buffy…" Giles said.</P>
<p>"We'll get her, just, don't move."</P>
<p>"The paramedics are on their way. Stay with him. I'll try and track down Buffy and Willow." Oz said.</P>
<p>"I'm not going anywhere."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Willow were walking in the direction of the library.</P>
<p>"I hope some of this stuff helps." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"It will. Faith wouldn't just kill for…"</P>
<p>"For fun? I don't know."</P>
<p>They both were quiet after that. They walked for another block or two before Oz's van whipped around the corner and came to a screeching halt beside the sidewa lk. He jumped out and opened the sliding side door.</P>
<p>"What is it?" Willow vocalized the question they were both afraid to ask.</P>
<p>"Giles. Hospital." They looked at one another and hopped into the van. </P>
<p>Faith watched, and saw the color drain from Buffy's face as she closed the door, and the van sped off.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In his office, the Mayor placed the Box of Gavrock on his desk as Faith entered, smiling.</P>
<P>"He's dropped, boss."</P>
<P>"Applause, applause."</P>
<P>"The look on her face..." She closed her eyes, picturing it. "It was a good time."</P>
<P>"Well, that should keep her occupied for a spell."</P>
<P>"What next?"</P>
<P>"The Ritual of Gavrock. I have to ingest several of the inhabitants of this box."</P>
<P>"Ingest?"</P>
<P>"Eat."</P>
<P>"You're wicked gross."</P>
<P>He chuckled. "Well, you don't have to watch. Just, you know, go home, take it easy. It's a big day tomorrow."</P>
<P>"You gotta give me something to do. There's no way I'm sleeping. Don't you need anyone dead? Or maimed? I can settle for maimed."</P>
<P>"You little firecracker."</P>
<p>Her high on her success suddenly faded, and she sank into the chair in front of his desk. "My mom used to call me that when I was little. I was always running around."</P>
<P> She looked down at her feet and then back up at his concerned expression. "Tomorrow, at the Ascension and all that, am I going to get to fight?"</P>
<P>"If everything goes smoothly, you won't have to. But how often do things go smoothly?"</P>
<P>"So you'll still need me in there."</P>
<P>"Always."</P>
<P>"When I was a kid, a couple of miles outside of Boston there was this quarry. And all the kids used to swim there and jump off the rocks. And there was this one rock like forty feet up. I was the only one that would jump off it. All the older kids were too scared."</P>
<P>"Not you though." He smiled at her.</P>
<P>"Nah. I could do it easy."</P>
<P>"Get some rest."</P>
<P>"Good luck with your spiders there."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Oz, Buffy, and Willow rushed down the third floor hallway of the hospital and saw Xander sitting in a chair.</P>
<P>"Where is he?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>As Xander pointed to the room across the hall, they saw Cordelia running down the hall towards them.</P>
<P>"How -" Willow started.</P>
<P>"Xander called me."</P>
<P>"They're not letting anybody in." Xander said.</P>
<P>Buffy watched as a doctor headed into the room, and rushed to get in front of her.</P>
<P>"Sorry, family only." The doctor said.</P>
<P>"He has n…I'm his daughter."</P>
<P>The doctor regarded her for a minute, and then they both went in. Giles was strapped to the bed, and an IV was coming from his arm. He looked sickly. Buffy stood over him. His eyes were closed, but his face was clearly strained.</P>
<P>"What's wrong with him? And why is he tied -" </P>
<P>"I can tell you what, but I can't tell you how. Your father's nerve endings are shutting down. He's been having periods of convulsions and spasms. I…there's nothing from the description that your friend gave me, that I can see, that would have caused this."</P>
<P>"What -"</P>
<P>"If we don't figure out how to treat him, he will slowly become paralyzed, and the way his body seems to be cutting its connection to his nervous system…"</P>
<P>"He'll be a vegetable?" The doctor nodded. "No, he can't. He…"</P>
<P>"I'm sorry. I'll be back later to check on him."</P>
<P>She left, and Buffy looked down at Giles, who was weakly opening his eyes.</P>
<P>"Hey." Buffy smiled down at him with tears welling up in her eyes. "How are you feeling?"</P>
<P>"Can't… feel…my legs."</P>
<P>"It's just your imagination. You're going to be fine."</P>
<P>"The Ascen -"</P>
<P>"I'll deal with that. You just relax okay? I'll get my mom to come by, and you can have someone to talk to."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy came out of the room, and wiped the tears from her eyes. Everyone stood up.</P>
<P>"Okay. We need to find out where Faith is, and I mean now."</P>
<P>"Why?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"Best bet is she did this to Giles, and he hasn't got much time. I'm hoping she knows how to help him."</P>
<P>"What's wrong with -"</P>
<P>"His brain's gonna shut down, and if it does…"</P>
<P>"Permanent resident of the hospital." Xander said.</P>
<P>"But he won't be Giles, he -" Cordelia was panicking.</P>
<P>"That's why I need you guys to find out where Faith lives. I need to get Wesley, he'll work on the Ascension, and I need to get mom."</P>
<P>"We'll do it, Buffy. Giles will be fine." Willow said trying to stay positive for her.</P>
<P>Buffy wanted to break down, Willow could see that, but she couldn't afford to. Not while Giles' life was in her hands.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy and Willow were looking at the library's computer. Willow was trying to work as fast as possible to find Faith's address. Wesley was looking at Mr. Wirth's notes, and the others were looking in books.</P>
<P>"How close are you?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"Just a few more minutes. What are you going to do?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"Anything I have to do."</P>
<P>Buffy walked over to the book cage and started going through weapons.</P>
<P>"Fascinating." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"What?" They all asked.</P>
<P>"It seems our Mr. Wirth headed an expedition in Hawaii, digging in old lava beds near a dormant volcano."</P>
<P>"I'm not fascinated yet." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"He found something underneath. A carcass, buried by an eruption."</P>
<p>"And?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"A very large one. Mr. Wirth posits that it might be some heretofore undiscovered dinosaur."</P>
<p>"Could be what he's changing into. Explains the kill, anyway." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Great. So all we need is a million tons of burning lava. We're saved." Buffy said, grabbing a knife. It was the one Faith had used to kill one of the Gavrock spiders. Buffy had grabbed it before they left the school that night.</P>
<P>"I found it!" Willow called.</P>
<P>"Good. I'm ready to go."</P>
<P>"Buffy, I understand your attachment to Giles, however…" Wesley started.</P>
<P>"No, I don't think you do. He's…he's important to me.  More than I ever thought he would be. And, he's the only reason I still listen to you. So, don't get in my way."</P>
<P>"The Council's orders are to concentrate on..."</P>
<P>"Orders? I don't think I'm gonna be taking any more orders. Not from you, not from them."</P>
<P>"You can't turn your back on the Council."</P>
<P>"They're in England. I don't think they can tell which way my back is facing."</P>
<P>Wesley looked to everyone else for support.</P>
<P>"Hey, Wes, I'm sorry you can't get your mind around this, but Giles keeps us together. I can be a real ass sometimes," He looked at Cordelia, "and get on his nerves, but he always forgives me. He's like the dad I wish I had." Xander said.</P>
<P>"He's right. We're um, God I can't believe I'm saying this, like a family, and he watches out for us. Even for me." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>"He's the most understanding and caring man we know." Willow said.</P>
<P>"And seeing how most Watchers turn out like mindless drones, surprisingly, he actually came out of it with a mind of his own. Gotta save it." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Wesley, go back to your Council and tell them, until the next Slayer comes along, they can close up shop. I'm not working for them anymore." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Don't you see what's happening? Faith poisoned Giles to distract you, to keep you out of the Mayor's way, and it's working. You need a strategy."</P>
<P>"I have a strategy. You're not in it."</P>
<P>"This is mutiny."</P>
<P>Buffy was quiet for a moment. "I like to think of it as graduation." </P>
<P>She walked past Wesley and over to Willow, who handed her a slip of paper with the address on it.</P>
<P>"Good luck." Willow said, and kissed her quickly.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In Faith's apartment, she was reading a comic book while music blared. Buffy was behind her, by the door. She turned off the stereo. Faith turned around, and smiled.</P>
<P>"Thought I'd stop by." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Is he dead yet?"</P>
<P>"No, and he won't be. Because you're going to give me the cure."</P>
<P>"Cure?"</P>
<P>"Faith, I have zero patience left. Give me the cure, and I can walk out of here."</P>
<P>"Not that easy, B. You think I'd let the guy stick the boss with a sword and get away with it? I ain't handing it over. How far are you willing to go?"</P>
<P>"As far as you."</P>
<P>"You ready to die?"</P>
<P>"Are you? F?"</P>
<P>"He hasn't got much time. Ready to cut loose?"</P>
<P>"Try me."</P>
<P>They stepped up close to one another. So close, that there was no space between them.</P>
<P>"Okay then. Give us a kiss."</P>
<P>Buffy punched her jaw, and the fight began.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the hospital, Joyce was watching over Giles. The paralysis had moved up past his waist. </P>
<P>"You can't die on her. You're the only father she's got now. Maybe ever had."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Not getting tired are you? I'm just starting to feel it." Faith said standing behind Buffy. She had her arms around Buffy's neck, choking her. They had moved the fight up to a raised level by the window. They were standing behind an indoor pipe.</P>
<P>Buffy head-butted her, and flipped her over onto her back. Faith jumped back up quickly, and kicked her in the stomach, and forced her back into the wall. She rushed up and grabbed Buffy by the shirt, and Buffy grabbed hers.</P>
<P>The forced each other through the window, and they landed on a lower roof, glass shattering around them. While Faith was recovering from the fall, Buffy handcuffed Faith's wrist to hers. </P>
<P>"Stick around." Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Oh! Here!" Willow exclaimed throwing a notebook down.</P>
<P>"Something about the demon?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"The villagers near the volcano site made reference to the legend of Ollokai. It might have something to do with Olvikan."</P>
<P>"Who's Olvikan?"</P>
<p>"Think I saw him in this book. Picture too." Oz said.</P>
<p>They all gathered around Oz, absent Wesley, who had left.</P>
<P>"Come on Olvikan. Hey." Xander said.</P>
<P>Oz found it, and Cordelia started unfolding the long centerfold containing a picture. They all drew in a breath.</P>
<P> "Ideas anyone? Maybe last wishes?" Xander asked.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the Mayor's office, one of the Gavrock spiders was pinned, unmoving, to his desk with a knife. One's legs were already sticking out of the Mayor's mouth. He chewed and swallowed. A vampire looked on, uncertain.</P>
<P>"My god, what a feeling. The power of these creatures. It suffuses my being. I can feel the changes begin. My organs are shifting, changing, making ready for the Ascension. Plus these babies are high in fiber. And what's the fun in becoming an immortal demon if you're not regular, am I right?"</P>
<P>A second vampire ran into the room.</P>
<P>"We don't knock during dark rituals?"</P>
<P>"Sir, there may be trouble. At Faith's."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"What's the matter? All that killing and you're afraid to die?" Buffy asked holding Faith's arm.</P>
<P>Faith spun Buffy so she could get leverage to use her legs and managed to snap the handcuff chain. They were facing off. Faith held a length of pipe. Buffy pulled out Faith's knife.</P>
<P>"That's mine."</P>
<P>"You're about to get it back."</P>
<P>They exchanged blows, Faith dodging the knife. They moved to the edge of the roof and Faith held Buffy at the edge.</P>
<P>"Man, I'm going to miss this." Buffy broke Faith's grip and plunged the knife into Faith's abdomen. She quickly pulled it out, and they both looked stunned, as Faith looked down at her stomach. "You did it."</P>
<P>Faith threw Buffy away from her, and a small vial fell to the ground of the roof.</P>
<P>"You killed me."</P>
<P>Faith climbed onto the low wall at the edge of the roof and looked down. She saw a pickup truck coming close, with a large crate structure in the back. "Shoulda been there, B. Quite a ride."</P>
<P>She fell backward off the wall and landed in the hay bed of the truck. Buffy scrambled to the wall and saw Faith's body, unmoving, ride away.</P>
