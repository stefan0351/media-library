<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 6 -->

<p>"I must say, you have an extraordinary talent for the
supernatural." Wesley noticed that Tara seemed uncomfortable with the
compliment, but he just assumed that it was because of the girl's shy
nature. She did however smile. "T...thank you." He smiled as he sat
down next to her. The two Watchers were working with the Wiccan and
the former vengeance demon while the rest of the combined team was out
doing legwork. They were responsible for going through Wesley's
library as well as looking over the books they brought with them in
greater detail. "Though I understand you are actually practicing?" She
nodded as he continued. "That was forbidden back in England, not at
all proper you know." She looked at him with an odd look. "You mean
you spent all those hours in the library with the books you loved but
were never curious about what was inside?"</p>

<p>Wesley seemed rather uncomfortable. "Well… yes. I mean I
assume most experimented at one point or another, but not to the point
or finding a partner or working spells on any regular basis. I mean an
exorcism here or there as needed, but we were taught to stay well away
from it." Tara's expression grew sad. "That's sad. I mean if you have
an aptitude for magic… I mean I do and the magic I work with Willow…
well I've never been happier." He seemed to look serious. "And the
Watcher's Council would condemn you for it." Then he smiled. "Good
thing I'm no longer a Watcher." She smiled back at him as Anya came
bursting in. "You can talk about Wesley's hang ups later." He stood
up. "I beg your pardon?" Anya waved a hand at him. "You can beg me
later. Your library has reference to the Sentinel!" Tara stood up on
impulse as well as the three of them moved to look at the scroll Anya
was holding. As Wesley got close he took off his glasses. </p>

<p>"I recognize that. Angel managed to bring it back with the
prophecy." The two girls looked at him and nearly spoke in unison.
"Prophecy?" Wesley looked like a deer caught in the headlights, but he
shook himself immediately. "Nothing, just an unrelated prophecy that's
part of an ongoing investigation." The blondes looked skeptical, but
seemed willing to drop the issue as Tara spoke. "We should tell Mr.
Giles." Wesley nodded. "Quite right." He then led the two over to
where Rupert Giles was pouring through an ancient tome, which was
lying next to a rather large pile of similar books. As they approached
they were not at all quiet about it and Giles looked up at them. "Did
you find something?" Tara was smiling. "Yep, we found something. Well
Anya found something. What did we find?" At that she tried to look
over at the scroll but Anya was unrolling it on the table that Giles
was working at.</p>

<p>"I found the spell that they used to bind the Sentinel." Giles
took his glasses off and began reading the scroll, and as he got more
and more amazed Anya looked more and more pleased with herself. "Yes,
yes that's exactly what you found, and with this we will be able to
figure out how to counter it." Wesley looked over the scroll at the
same time. "Does that mean that we will still need to penetrate the
Wolfram and Heart offices?" Giles nodded "I'm afraid it does. What
this scroll does is guarantee that if we can get to the Sentinel we
can free it and quite quickly I might add." Tara had managed to
squeeze into a spot close enough to look at the scroll. "Willow and I
can start working as soon as they get back."</p>

<p>At that precise moment the doors opened to admit Xander, Gunn
and Willow. Giles, Wesley and Anya all locked at Tara with shocked
expressions. Tara seemed shocked as well, but she was smiling as she
laid eyes on Willow. When Willow laid eyes on Tara she sped up her
pace and quickly wrapped Tara in a hug. A tight one if Tara's grunt
was any indication. Anya seemed ready to do the same, but when she got
close to Xander she stopped. "Xander, you stink. Why do you stink?" He
shrugged slightly. "Cordite." She looked confused. "Cordite, what's
cordite?" Giles stood as he heard that. "Cordite? What happened?" Anya
interrupted Xander's reply. "What happened? What's cordite? And why
does your shirt have holes?" Xander sighed warily. "Cordite is the
blue smoke left after gunpowder ignites." Anya grabbed Xander and
started running her hands over him to look for wounds, something Tara
started to do to Willow. "Gunpowder! You were shot?" </p>

<p>Xander nodded. "Several times, but the vest stopped em."
Willow caught Tara's hands and then kissed her. "I'm fine. Xander
protected me." She smiled over at her friend as Tara clutched her to
her chest, also smiling at Xander but her face was pale while she
mouthed the words "thank you". He smiled back at the two of them. "Now
if you don't mind I'd like to sit down." Willow agreed. "Yes, sitting,
sitting is good." As they all moved to the couches in the lobby Giles
and Wesley looked at Gunn, for his part the man shrugged. "Don't look
at me. I was just the wheelman. It was those two going Wild West in
there." Both Anya and Tara were thinking alike as they refused to let
go of their respective lovers while Xander resumed the narrative. As
he finished their listeners all seemed shocked. Giles was the first to
express it.</p>

<p>"You killed human beings?" Xander looked directly into his
eyes. "I killed the enemy." Giles shook his head. "But they were still
human beings." Xander kept the gaze locked. "So? Should we let them
keep this Sentinel imprisoned? Or maybe we should have just let them
catch me and Willow and then take us someplace private to put a bullet
in the back of our heads?" Anya spoke up. "I don't like that idea."
Xander actually grinned and gave her a kiss. "Me neither, and that's
why I killed them. I wasn't willing to die, and I wasn't willing to
let them keep doing evil. That's the thing Giles. We are not talking
dupes or pawns, they were not innocent. They went into this with their
eyes open and CHOSE to serve the forces of darkness, and when I last
checked that's who we were fighting."</p>

<p>Giles looked sad. "Yes, but where's the line?" "The line is
that I didn't like it. In fact I hated it, I know full well I am going
to loose sleep over this, but I will be around to loose that sleep."
Tara was rubbing up and down Willow's arms. "What about you?" Willow
sighed and snuggled against Tara's shoulder. "I didn't have to do
anything, not really. It was just a matter of seeing what Xander had
to do." Xander looked ready to apologize, but she raised her head and
shook it. "It's ok Xander. It's like you said. We had to stop them,
and the only way we could do that was killing them. I'm going to loose
some sleep too, but living with it still has that whole living part."
With that she snuggled back against Tara who actually seemed to be
rocking her slightly." Xander had been looking at Willow, but he
looked back at Giles.</p>

<p>"And that's the best way to say it. We'll learn to live with
it, but we have to be alive to do so, and just because their human
doesn't mean they can't do evil." Giles nodded. "That is true."
"That's all true, but you'll still need to see how well you live with
it." The gathered group looked over to see Angel and Cordelia
entering. Xander shrugged. "I feel bad about having to kill, but I
don't feel bad about surviving. If they had given me another option I
would have taken it." Angel was sullen but he nodded as Giles asked
Angel and Cordelia a question. "Where are Buffy and Faith?" Both
seemed to get a soured expression as they answered in unison. "With
Spike." That seemed to spread the soured disposition to everyone in
the room.  Willow looked absolutely shocked. "You left them, in LA,
with Spike?" The two looked abashed, but nodded.</p>

<p>Giles looked sickened while Xander spoke. "I'm not sure who we
should be more worried about, Spike, or Faith. Either way I think
Buffy is in trouble." Giles nodded. "Either way I think it is safe to
say they will not be back till the early morning. Shall we retire?"
They all nodded and began standing up. The Scooby gang nodded and
started heading for the stairs while Angel investigations moved
towards the doors. All of them saying various goodnights. As Willow
and Tara got to their room Tara seemed to keep examining Willow with
her eyes. "Are you sure you're ok?" Willow nodded and smiled slightly.
"Yeah, I'm ok. I just want a shower." Tara's voice was quiet as she
spoke. "Want some company?" Willow smiled uncontrollably as she
blushed and nodded. </p>

<p>Both of the girls undressed and put their clothes aside. Both
naked, they padded into the bathroom and stepped into the shower
stall. Tara stood behind Willow and reached around her to turn on the
water. As the spray started hitting them she took the sponge and
lathered it up. Running it over Willow's shoulders and down her spine
she felt Willow shudder as she sighed happily. "So what happened?"
Willow's head slumped forward and Tara stepped closer to wrap a free
hand around Willow's waist. She wasn't sure if she was going to get an
answer until Willow started to speak. "It's hard to remember. I mean
it all happened so fast. I mean first Xander maced to guys and beat
them up in the office we were using. Then we got out in the hall and
they started shooting at us, so Xander shot back." Tara kissed
Willow's shoulder in silent support as she continued speaking.</p>

<p>"Then we heard them over the radio saying they were entering
the stairs so we tried getting out of them, but that was a trap cause
they shot Xander." While her first shudder and been one of pleasure at
the soft touches the one that went through her this time was at the
pain of the memory. "I thought he was dead Tara. I thought they had
killed him. I thought that I was all alone and I would never get out
there." Tara set the sponge aside and pulled Willow into her arms. She
nestled Willow to her bosom and stroked the red head's damp hair. At
first all Willow was able to do was cling to Tara and try to calm her
breathing. She managed to do that and looked up into Tara's eyes. "I
love you." Tara's eyes looked back into Willow's. "I love you too." A
statement that she punctuated with a kiss. Willow turned back around
and Tara resumed scrubbing her back.</p>

<p>"But he was wearing a vest and he was ok. So he shot them." At
this point Tara had finished with the back and moved to scrub Willow's
front. Starting at the top she ran the sponge around Willow's breasts,
something that caused an abrupt stop to the story. She stopped.
"Sorry." Willow's voice seemed dreamy. "No… it's all right." The small
grin on her girlfriend's face appeared on Tara's as well. While she
started making gentle circles on Willow's abdomen the story continued.
"So he shot them, and we made our way to the fire stairs." There was a
pause and a deep breath. "But they found us there too, and Xander used
a grenade." Willow shuddered again. "Before it was just people
falling. I mean we were running and so I never really looked at them,
but there, there I slipped in the blood. That caused Tara to look and
she noticed the nasty bruise on Willow's knee. She scrubbed the
abdomen another couple times and then knelt down. </p>

<p>There she began scrubbing Willow's legs, paying extra special
attention to the injured area. "I, I asked Xander for his can of mace
because I didn't want to just put it on him. I was going to fight to
get back to you." Tara tossed her hair back over her shoulder as she
looked up and smiled at Willow. Smiling back at her Willow kept
speaking. "We managed to get down to the parking garage, and Gunn was
there, but a security team had tried to stop him. He had managed to
get five of them, but the sixth had his gun at Gunn's head. So Xander
kept him distracted while I snuck up and maced him. Gunn hit the guy
and we all got in his truck and headed back here." Tara had reached
the point she was scrubbing Willow's thighs and had her other hand at
the small of Willow's back to brace herself as she looked up. "You
came back to me." Willow had seemed to stop breathing as the muscles
in her thighs tensed. "Tara? Can we go to bed? I… I need you." Tara
stood up and shut off the water. Taking Willow by the hand she led her
from the shower. "Let's go to bed."</p>

<p>In another room in the hotel a similar process was going on.
"What's that? I thought you said the vest stopped the bullets?" Xander
nodded and ran his hand over his chest, which carried roughly half a
dozen quarter-sized bruises. "It did stop them, but they were going
very fast when they stopped." Anya looked at him with her face twisted
in a pout. "I don't like this Xander. I don't like you being in
situations that could take you away from me." He pulled her into his
arms and kissed her forehead. "I don't like being in those situations,
but I've been fighting evil for five years now, and I don't see myself
stopping." She turned from him and crossed her arms over her chest. He
stepped up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. "Think of
it like this. The Xander you fell in love with fought evil. If I
didn't fight evil would I still be your Xander?"</p>

<p>She turned around and kissed his bare chest. "You smell much
better after your shower, and you will always be my Xander." His hands
rubbed up and down her back. "Yes, but would I be the Xander you fell
in love with?" Her face scrunched up. "Well… I guess not." He smiled.
"Go take your shower. I'm going to get ready for bed." She smiled at
him and went into the bathroom. After she left and he heard the water
start running he allowed out the groan he had been holding back. Sure
the vest kept the bullets from entering his body but they still felt
like supersonic punches to the chest. He had already taken off the
vest and had determined it was still useable, but he decided that
after this mission was over he was going to have to look into
procuring another one.</p>

<p>The vest was already soaking to remove the combined stinks of
his sweat and the cordite so he started taking the guns apart and
using the cleanser on them. He had managed to score a position in
logistics, and with the help of Willow's computer skills and the
overall cumbersome bureaucracy he was able to siphon off the supplies
he needed. Now he was trying to think of where a vest could go missing
with out being missed. All the while he kept maintaining his equipment
with an efficiency that went beyond his conscious thoughts. Yet he
didn't think it was all because of Ethan Rayne's spell. It felt too
right to just be the magic. Of course maybe that was part of the
spell, he DID become an entirely different personality, but he didn't
when he used the skills. Sure the knowledge got dumped in at once, but
it felt like it was his. Of course maybe the spell just took over his
personality more then it did Buffy or Willow.</p>

<p>He shook his head and forced his mind off that train of
thought. The fact was he had assimilated the skills, and he was
putting them to good use. Maybe Ethan made him into a killing machine,
or maybe he had just unlocked Xander's inner solider. The fact was
that he was a solider, literally now a member of the United States
Armed Forces. Even more then that he was part of an operation that saw
action almost every night and was fighting for a great cause, all of
humanity. The one thing he did know is that whatever Ethan had done to
him it had went far beyond some supernatural Halloween prank. As he
finished assembling his gear he loaded a clip into his pistol and
thought that the next time he saw Ethan Rayne maybe he could show the
evil wizard just how far it had gone. He got under the covers and let
out a huge sigh of contentment. Anya had yet to return from her
shower, and while she didn't like it when he fell asleep with out her
he thought the battle with his fatigue was one he was going to loose.</p>
