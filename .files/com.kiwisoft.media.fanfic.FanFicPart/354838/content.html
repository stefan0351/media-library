		HeghmeH QaQ DaHjaj - Klingon for "Today is a good day to die"<br>
		HeghmeH QaQ Hochjaj - Klingon for "Everyday is a good day to die"</p>

		<p>"Permanent data link with the Delta flyer established," Seven announced.</p>

		<p>"Acknowledged. Let's get started. Wish us luck," B'Elanna replied, momentarily forgetting the Borg nature of her friend.</p>

		<p>"Luck is irrelevant, Lieutenant. With our combined abilities and knowledge a success in completing this task is highly probable," Seven declared. She had no doubt as to whether they would succeed or not. They were the best, they would do the job and succeed, it was that easy.</p>

		<p>"True, but Seven, the next time, just say 'good luck B'Elanna', okay?" The half-Klingon replied a little unnerved by the typical Borg answer she had got.</p>

		<p>"I will comply, good luck, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"Good luck, Seven."</p>

		<p>"HeghmeH QaQ DaHjaj," Seven decided to throw in for good measure.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna thought she hadn't heard right. Seven speaking Klingon? This woman was amazing, there were only 3 crew members on Voyager who could speak Klingon, B'Elanna herself, the Doctor and Captain Janeway. Not very surprisingly Tom had never bothered to learn the language of B'Elanna's people.</p>

		<p>She was uncertain as to how to respond but decided just to give the expected answer: "HeghmeH QaQ Hochjaj!"</p>

		<p>Having exchanged niceties, they now again devoted all their attention to their task.</p>

		<p>"The navigational systems of the Delta flyer have plotted a course out of the nebula. Accessing the data." Seven was now hitting buttons on her workstation; B'Elanna was doing the same across from her.</p>

		<p>"Your program is determining the exact amount of energy, we must now adjust the energy flow to the respective thrusters," Seven continued.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The seconds seemed to stretch to minutes, the minutes to hours as Seven and B'Elanna silently worked together to get Voyager out of that darn nebula, that was so full of dangerous particles. B'Elanna had no time at all to think about the discoveries she had made earlier. About Seven's feelings, about her feelings. When Voyager finally slid out of the nebula and was sufficiently remote from this intricate stellar phenomenon, she let out a sigh and hit her controls to shut down Voyager's impulse engines. But even now there was no time to think, about Seven, or about the relationship with Tom, for she first had to go attend a senior officers meeting. And after that there was still enough left to do in Engineering and sometime in the near future she had even planned on sleeping for more than 3 hours in one piece.</p>

		<p>It had been 5 hours since B'Elanna had taken on the task of finding the damaged chip in the Jeffries tube. 'One more thing to do,' she mentally noted, as she remembered that she hadn't completed that task.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Seven had no idea, what emotional turmoil she had caused in B'Elanna when she had stated something rather obvious. She assumed that everyone exerted the same practice of not lying to oneself, so it never occurred to her that Torres had never before consciously confronted her feelings for the pilot, or rather the lack thereof.</p>

		<p>Seven, too had much to do before she could really think about the new developments in her relationship with Voyager's chief engineer. Astrometrics were part of the navigational systems, so she had a lot of work waiting for her in her domain. She also had to do some serious research about friendship, because never before she had bothered to research this particular topic, it had seemed like a waste of time, since nobody besides a hologram and Janeway had made efforts to become her friends, anyway.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>In the conference room the senior officers and Seven and Neelix were gathering. When all had sat down Janeway spoke up, "Let's get started. Doctor please begin," she ordered, for she first wanted to know how her crew was.</p>

		<p>"There were only five injured and no-one too badly. No casualties. Oh by the way, Captain, I need Seven down in Sick bay for at least half an hour after this meeting," the doctor reported.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, I have work to do in Astrometrics, if you need an engineer, I am sure Lt. Torres...."</p>

		<p>"But I need no engineer, Seven, I need you. Naomi Wildman was among the injured and she requested your presence in sick bay. As her physician I am sure it would help to accelerate the healing process. Happy patients get faster healthy again."</p>

		<p>"With the Captain's permission, I will comply." Seven answered. B'Elanna could see the worry Seven felt for her little friend. The ex-drone looked questioningly at the captain, who silently nodded her permission.</p>

		<p>Janeway felt irrationally responsible for Naomi being injured. She was the only child aboard Voyager and the Captain felt like had she been a better captain Naomi would not be injured now, hell if she had been a better captain, Naomi would have a real home now, on earth and she would have a father and other children to play with. After all it had been her decision that had left them all stranded here in the Delta Quadrant. And now she couldn't even prevent them from further damage. - Janeway snapped out of her self recriminations and decided it was time to continue. "B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Down in Engineering it will take at least 2 days to make all the repairs. I will certainly not again underestimate mere particles," she said.</p>

		<p>"As I am sure no one else on this ship will ever again," Kim interjected.</p>

		<p>"Unfortunately, the particles not only overloaded many of our systems, they also somehow managed to suck energy out of Voyager. Our power reserves are down, we need dilithium, captain."</p>

		<p>"How urgent is this problem, B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Well Voyager could go on another 1 and a half months," B'Elanna admitted. Since she was finished with her report and the captain seemed to have no further questions, B'Elanna wanted to know something. "Call me curious Captain, but I for one would really like to know how we got into this nebula in the first place," B'Elanna asked. She had had no more time to read logs then she had had to think. And if something had damaged systems throughout Voyager that she had to repair, she'd really like to know how they got the chance to do so in the first place.</p>

		<p>Briefly glancing at Tom, a glance that B'Elanna saw, Captain Janeway answered her question. "It seems like someone miscalculated our course, so it was the computer that took us in here."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was now glaring at her boyfriend. "You brought us in here?" she accused, "you could have gotten us all killed, with your incompetence ....."</p>

		<p>"Lt. Torres, hold it, I don't want to hear it. I assure you Mr. Paris has been sufficiently reprimanded, but it was an accident. -"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, an accident that got us all nearly killed and heavily damaged my ship." Oops that was definitely the wrong to say in front of the captain of said ship.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant, last time I checked, Voyager was still 'my' ship, besides accusations will take you nowhere."</p>

		<p>"And are inefficient," Seven added.</p>

		<p>Janeway glared at Seven, believing she had said that deliberately to further aggravate B'Elanna, and the least she needed in this time of crisis was an angry Klingon assaulting a crew member.</p>

		<p>But B'Elanna surprised all, even Seven, when she noticeably calmed down and said, "You know what Seven? You are right. It is inefficient." With that she grew silent and waited for the Captain to continue the meeting.</p>

		<p>The reports from the other departments were short and had nothing important to say, B'Elanna was bored and longed for the chance to get back to her precious engines. Eventually the captain was giving her final orders: "After your visit of Naomi, you are to help in Engineering, Seven, that is if that's okay with you, Lt.," she addressed B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"I would greatly appreciate it, Captain, Seven will be a big help," B'Elanna answered enthusiastically, she was really looking forward to having Seven help her. True the drone didn't ever follow protocol, but she was a genius with her tools, like B'Elanna herself.</p>

		<p>It was at that time, that the captain decided that Seven and B'Elanna had cleared away their differences and were quickly becoming friends. She could tell that by what she had seen and heard in the past hour. Janeway was close to both, well as close as the half-Klingon and the ex-Borg would let anybody get, and had always thought they could be good friends, they had so much in common, not only engineering, but being torn between two heritages, too. But the others were surprised, well except of course Tuvok. And Tom, he was looking suspicious.</p>

		<p>'Of what would he be suspicious,' Janeway briefly wondered, but dismissed the thought as she once again concentrated on the meeting.</p>

		<p>"When Astrometrics are repaired, you do sensor sweeps of the neighbouring space, we need dilithium," she ordered Seven.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Captain," was the ex-drone's reply.</p>

		<p>Janeway ordered, "Dismissed." and the other officers filed out of the conference room. She noticed that Seven and B'Elanna almost immediately after being dismissed began a talk, apparently about how to repair various systems. Tom who tried to get B'Elanna's attention was completely ignored. He was puzzled, but dismissed it as B'Elanna going over to her "chief-engineer-mode".</p>
