<!-- A Connected Love \ Epilogue: Explaining -->

<p>Giles and Cordelia listened carefully to what the two lovers told them. Xander had went into the kitchen to get something to eat after the part concerning the 'lovers' had started.</p>
<p>"So you two have the same powers as those two, and they were the first on this realm?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"More or less. They weren't the first humans here, they were the first real fighters for this world. They were humans that were given the powers from the 'Mortal Realm' combined with the knowledge and some power of the heavenly forces...yeah I think that's what they called it.They told us that in some cases the powers are more on the side of the magic, in other cases the Warrior gets more of it. But together we have exactly the same powers as they had."</p>
<p>"And you say that they are immortal?" this time it was Cordelia who asked.</p>
<p>"They are and we will be as soon as we give the powers to the next generation. Or at least that is what they told us." Willow smiled. She very much liked the thought of being able to stay with Buffy for such a long time.</p>
<p>"And tell me again why you don't do this now, but later?"</p>
<p>"Because they said that it was a little too difficult to give the powers they had to only two humans of the next generation. They had to split it up and every 3600 years when the 'Powers of Darkness', as they called it, are able to open a portal to this world, they have enough strength to focus all the power again into two humans. And in this cycle, Willow and I are those two chosen ones, as silly as this may sound at the moment. And in the next 3600 years they will be too weak to focus those powers again."</p>
<p>"Ok, I think I understand this now. Did they tell you when you will have encounter this threat?"</p>
<p>"Except for 'soon'? No. They just said that we would have enough time to learn to control our powers. But from what I have seen how strong Wills already is I don't know how long that could be."</p>
<p>"Well I hope we have enough time to work this out. I really don't want to battle hell all too soon. I think we really have earned us a short break." Cordy said.</p>
<p>"Ah.. yes..well it seems that we have always underestimated you two. I am just glad that you are on our side."</p>
<p>"Giles you don't have to do that. Don't you see that you embarrass them?" Xander came back with a piece of cake and a huge pile of whipped cream on top.</p>
<p>'You know, as much as I like it how Giles looks when he's blushing, I really know better ways of using this time.' Buffy squeezed Willows hand.</p>
<p>"Buffy!"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>'You know exactly what I meant.'</p>
<p>'Do I?'</p>
<p>'Yes you do Buffy. And don't play this game, they all know about what we have.'</p>
<p>"Ok, ok, you are absolutely right Wills."</p>
<p>"Well...I think we know enough for the moment. I just have to find out what we can do to help you two in the coming fight."</p>
<p>"Giles we really appreciate your help, but we have no clue what will happen ourselves. We will meet Birgit and Christopher in a few days and then we'll try to find a few things out that will help us but until then you can relax. You don't have to explain everything. Especially not those things that you wouldn't be able to find anyway without more details."</p>
<p>"Well...maybe you're right. I think we should stop this debate for now and just enjoy the peace we have at the moment."</p>
<p>"Thanks Giles. You know Buffy, I think we should go back to the dorm. I still have some homework I have to do."</p>
<p>"Sure, anything else Giles?"</p>
<p>"No... no I don't think so."</p>
<p>"Ok then we'll see ya all tomorrow. Bye Giles, Bye Xandman, Cordy."</p>
<p>"Yes tomorrow." Giles muttered.</p>
<p>With a few 'byes' hanging in the air Willow was being tugged out of the house just to stop there and be kissed.</p>
<p>"You know I like the way you think about homework lately."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>'Do the words: "I still have some homework I have to do with Buffy, on Buffy," remember you of something?'</p>
<p>Willow blushed. "I...you know that I... I just wanted to-" Buffy stopped her babble mode with a fast kiss.</p>
<p>"I know exactly what you meant. And as much as I like it here, it is although a little too public."</p><p>"Yeah I think your right. Come on I... WE have some homework to do."</p><p>Willow squeezed Buffy's hand and ran with her off to the dorm. They still had a few issues that they had to discuss but that would have to wait until after the 'Homework'.</p>
