THREE</b></p>
<p>Waves crashed against the shore, resounding quite loudly in Miley's ears. The sliding door leading out to the deck was open, and she could quite clearly hear her father strumming his guitar, his deep voice soothing as she lifted herself from the couch. The DVD case for the movie they watched the night before sat opened on the coffee table, just next to Lilly's backpack. Reaching up to scratch her head, Miley looked around her living room and into the kitchen. Where was she?</p>
<p>Miley could clearly remember last night, all the way up until she'd fallen asleep. After the movie, which ended around eleven, she and her friends had stayed up and talked for at least another half-hour. Oliver and Joannie were on the chair, their bodies overlapping to fit in the seat together. Lilly had been on the couch with her, curled up on one side while Miley was stretched out. And when Oliver and Joannie left, Lilly had simply crawled up the couch and lay partly on Miley, all the while continuing the conversation they'd been having.</p>
<p>Then – and Miley could remember the way she had frozen, the white noise in her mind clearing out as she focused solely on the words spoken – Lilly said: "We need to talk, missy. Don't think I haven't noticed the way you've been acting… I don't know what's going on with you, but both Oliver and I are concerned about you. So please, in the morning, we need to have a serious talk about what's going on with you."</p>
<p>Opting not to answer, Miley jerked her head up and down in understanding. She had stiffened considerably at Lilly's words, and she knew Lilly could tell, but the blonde hadn't said anything. Instead, she had promptly wrapped her arms around Miley's waist, buried her face in Miley's neck, and fell asleep. Miley almost jumped out of her skin at the contact, and though electricity ran through her veins at the constant contact, she had simply draped her arms around her friend and followed suit – she didn't have the heart to make her friend move.</p>
<p>But what happened after she had fallen asleep? Miley briefly remembered what she had dreamt about, but had it escalated beyond what she could remember? Or had consciousness stolen her memories of a dream that had been on a scale with her other dreams? As it was, her dream had been… incredibly sexy, but not like the others. In this one, she could vividly remember – of what she could remember, of course – sitting on the same deck that her father was now, Lilly in her arms and their lips connecting over and over again as they became familiar with each other's mouths, though not in the same frenzy they usually did. It was softer, but the passion she felt coursing through her veins gave her more than she could've ever imagined.</p>
<p>Huh. Maybe her body and mind were just giving her a break, realizing that if she'd had one of her dreams with Lilly literally on top of her, she'd do something that couldn't be taken back. After all, Miley didn't think she could explain her reasons for reversing their positions and taking Lilly on her family's couch.</p>
<p>"Morning, sunshine."</p>
<p>Miley relaxed at the sound of her best friend's voice, folding one leg under her as she sat sideways on the couch to watch her friend walk down the stairs. Her hair was mildly wet, and she was clad in her pajama bottoms and a plain shirt – both of them Miley's. Miley looked at her in confusion.</p>
<p>"I thought you brought a change of clothes." She questioned, raising an eyebrow as Lilly plopped down on the couch next to her.</p>
<p>Their sides were pressed together, and Miley could feel the warmth radiating from her best friend. It was comfortable and soothing. It was reassuring to find simple pleasure in her best friend, even with her crazed, unconscious mind blowing things out of proportion once the sun went down.</p>
<p>Lilly then wrapped one arm around Miley, who instantly leaned into the embrace, resting her head on her friend's shoulder, then wrapped the other one around her midsection. Miley did the same, wrapping both of her arms around Lilly's middle. "I did, but I kind of like the smell of your clothes, so I decided – what the hell? I knew you wouldn't care."</p>
<p>Miley buried her face into Lilly's shoulder, smiling broadly at her words. Then she looked up at her friend, the smile still on her face, but not a big. "S'okay. I know I smell good."</p>
<p>"I said your clothes, not you," Lilly teased with a wink.</p>
<p>"True," Miley shrugged, "However, chances are, I smell like my clothes. But it's okay, I know I smell absolutely wonderful. Nobody can resist, really."</p>
<p>Lilly poked Miley in the side, but held tight when Miley jerked. "You're right."</p>
<p>"About what?" Miley teased with a grin.</p>
<p>The blonde rolled her eyes, but met Miley with a grin of her own. "You were right – you do smell good. I'm sorry – absolutely wonderful, and I simply can't resist."</p>
<p>Miley playfully nipped at her shoulder. Then, she settled more comfortably against her best friend, her eyes sliding shut. The feeling of contentment wrapped itself around her, squeezing tightly. After several long moments, she spoke again, "You should get used to saying that I'm right, you know."</p>
<p>"Why?" Lilly asked, raising an eyebrow. "I don't ever need to say it."</p>
<p>Miley sat up and out of her friend's warm embrace. "Excuse me? What is that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p>"It means that you don't give me opportunities to say it very often," Lilly countered, scooting much closer to her friend, "But if you'd like to give me another one right now, I'm all for it. Just…"</p>
<p>"What do you have in mind?" Miley asked when Lilly didn't elaborate any further. She crossed her arms over her chest as she watched the blonde girl tap her chin in thought.</p>
<p>"I'll say something, and you repeat it." Lilly said, "For example, you say – 'I'm Hannah Montana'."</p>
<p>"I'm Hannah Montana." Miley repeated dutifully.</p>
<p>"You're right." When a throaty laugh escaped Miley, Lilly twisted her body to face Miley fully, smiling when Miley did the same. "Very good. Now say – 'I want you'."</p>
<p>The words flew out of Miley's lips before she could register them. "I want you." As the words spilled from her lips, she froze.</p>
<p>"You're right."</p>
<p>With that, Lilly leaned forward and grabbed Miley's shoulders gently, pressing their lips together. Underneath Lilly, Miley's mouth opened on its own accord, and her chest fluttered at the feel of Lilly's tongue against hers. It was a feeling she'd come to crave, and she had no problem admitting that – but she'd never tell her best friend that. Lilly's warm hand cupped Miley's cheek while her other arm slid around her waist and pulled her onto Lilly's lap. They continued kissing, Miley's own hands resting on Lilly's neck.</p>
<p>The need for oxygen never came, and Miley couldn't comprehend why until she pulled her lips from Lilly's. Her left hand rose to sit against Lilly's jaw, her thumb brushing against Lilly's bottom lip. The blonde's lips parted, and the tip of Miley's thumb slid against her front teeth before she withdrew her thumb altogether and stroked Lilly's cheek.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled gently at her, using the hand on Miley's cheek to pull her toward her again. Their foreheads rested gently against each other, their noses just barely brushing. Miley closed her eyes at the sensation, simply basking in the warmth of her best friend, the gentle embrace that Lilly held her in.</p>
<p>The arm around Miley's waist turned into a hand against her stomach, sliding beneath her shirt and onto her bare skin. It was still gentle as that hand left her stomach and dipped south and found incredible warmth beneath the cover of her underwear. Lilly pressed a kiss to Miley's lips as she slid her fingers into Miley; she was hot and tight and extremely slippery, and the feel of Lilly inside of her made goose bumps rise against Miley's skin.</p>
<p>"This is… some… dream…" Miley whispered as she nuzzled Lilly's neck, inhaling deeply.</p>
<p>Lilly stroked her cheek, a smile on her face as her blue eyes twinkled. "What if I told you this wasn't a dream? That this is really happening? What would you do, Miley?"</p>
<p>"I don't think I would care," Miley groaned softly, squeezing her eyes shut. "I'm almost there…"</p>
<p>"You really wouldn't care?" Lilly question, curling her fingers inside of Miley. "You'd sure as hell have an awkward conversation waiting for you, as would I."</p>
<p>The action drew a pleasured gasp from the taller girl, who pressed a kiss against Lilly's neck. "I don't think I'd care about anything as long as you're inside of me like this."</p>
<p>Miley's body stiffened and she let out a muffled moan into Lilly's skin, her hands gripping the blonde's shoulders tightly, her nails digging into the fabric of her shirt. Lilly withdrew her fingers from inside of Miley, continuing to stroke her after she came, calming the brunette down with her actions.</p>
<p>Lilly eventually withdrew her hand from Miley's pants, lifting her fingers to Miley's lips. Miley locked eyes with Lilly as she took them into her mouth, her eyes falling shut at the taste of herself. When her eyes reopened, Lilly was looking at her almost curiously. Then, Miley tensed considerably in Lilly's arms.</p>
<p>"When you asked me what I'd do if this was real, if this wasn't just a dream…" Lilly didn't respond, lifting a finger to trace Miley's jaw. Miley jerked back from her gentle touch. "Oh, <i>God</i>, please tell me that was just a hypothetical question, Lilly."</p>
