<p>Personal log, Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres</p>

		<p>Stardate ..... uh you know the drill</p>

		<p>It's a woman! I had that dream again and .... the person, the one who is holding me ..... it's a woman. The dream was more detailed this time. She is holding me, my head lies on her chest and I can feel her heart beat, a strong steady rhythm. Like the marriage drum ..... She says bangwIj again, I can't see her face, can't recognize her voice. And then I wake up. I can still hear the rhythm of her heartbeat, feel the warmth of her body pressing into mine in the fierce embrace we share. I am not interested in women, not in that way. What is she doing in my dreams? My subconscious again? I don't like that I get all worked up over a dream. I have to stop this. And I still have to face the captain.</p>

		<p>It's only 7 a. m.</p>

		<p>Oh, god, a woman! A woman calling me "loved one". Am I lesbian? Oh Kahless please no, Klingons don't do that kind of thing. But I love her. I feel it, even though it is only a dream. And among humans this isn't a big deal now, is it? Oh no, I am already thinking about consequences of a love that does not really exist! Perhaps I should talk to Chakotay. He is good in that kind of thing, counselling, interpreting dreams. Yeah I will do that, maybe he has time after his shift, I can talk to him then.</p>

		<p>Having finally made a decision I feel better, but there is still the captain wanting to talk to Seven and me ..... Chakotay will perhaps tell me it's nothing and give me some advise about dreams ..... I didn't do anything! It was all Seven's fault. I am sounding like a pouting kid; okay perhaps it was my fault, too. I did overreact a little, but I swear she is doing this deliberately. She seems to have no problem following proper procedure, when the doctor or the captain tell her to do so. Perhaps she's not having a problem with protocol but rather with me? Or perhaps she is doing some sort of study again. Human argument rituals or something. Oh what the hell does that matter? After all there is not much Janeway can do to punish me. Demotion is out of question, and I assign Engineering tasks, so she can't have me do some hard work. Worst that could happen is me having the night shift for a month ..... all I was doing was arguing a little, I didn't even hit her.</p>

		<p>I am starting to ramble again, no forget that, all I was saying in this log was rambling.</p>

		<p>I need to have breakfast.</p>

		<p>Bye computer</p>
