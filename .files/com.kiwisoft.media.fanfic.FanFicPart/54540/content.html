<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 11 -->

<p>Giles had just finished patrolling. When the sun had gone down and the
girls hadn't woken up, he decided to let them sleep while he made a
sweep. </p>

<p>After the thwarted attack on Buffy that morning, he had spent the rest
of the day watching over them and thinking about a plan. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I only hope they are willing to go along with it.&lt;&gt; Giles thought.
&lt;&gt;This is the first time I've called in outside help without their
consent, but I have no choice.&lt;&gt;
He kept up the mental dialogue all the way home. &lt;&gt;Anyone that can worm
their way through Willows defences and so thoroughly attack Buffy was a
formidable foe. The type of the attack also spoke volumes about the kind
of Magician that was behind it.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>By the time he walked into the door he was certain that his plan was the
only way to save the girls-from what he still wasn't sure-but he was
sure of the danger they were in. </p>

<p>"Buffy, Willow?" He called, when he didn't find them on the couch. He
felt a brief surge of panic at their absence and decided to call them at
their apartment next door inspite of the late hour. But, as he entered
the hallway Giles heard the raised voices of a heated argument. </p>

<p>"Willow you can't! You promised!" Buffys voice easily carried thorough
the closed door of his spare bedroom. "He'll tell mom...t-they'll h-hate
m-me! Or he will think I'm ready to be put away!" </p>

<p>The sound of her sobbing plea tore at the ex-Watchers heart, and made
him wonder what could possibly be so bad that Joyce might hate her for
it. Then he realized, nothing. Buffy wasn't thinking clearly. </p>

<p>"Buffy honey, don't cry." he heard Willow say as he reached up to knock
on the door. "We have to tell him so he can help us, Giles could never
hate you." </p>

<p>Giles could hear the near hysteria in Willows voice. Hoping that what he
had to say would allay their fears, Giles knocked lightly on the door.
Instantly, Buffys crying stopped. </p>

<p>"Yeah?" Willow called out. "Is that you Giles?" </p>

<p>"Yes, are you clothed?" He asked. "I believe we need to talk." </p>

<p>"I bet." he heard Buffy say sarcastically. "He's probably been snooping
around out there spying on us." </p>

<p>"Buffy please!" Willow hissed, embarrassed by her companions rude
remark. Then she called out "Come on in Giles." </p>

<p>He cautiously stepped through the door. Looking around he saw Buffy
sitting on the floor facing a corner hugging her knees. Her body was
shaking as she tried to hide her sobbing from him. </p>

<p>Willow was sitting on the edge of the bed; her entire body ridged with
tension and her eyes were red and puffy and locked on Buffy. Giles could
see the trails left by the young witchs tears. He surmised the argument
had been going on for some time before he arrived. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry if we disturbed you, Giles." Willow said softly her voice
trembling with emotion, her eyes never leaving her lover. "There seems
to be a minor break down in communications." </p>

<p>"I see." Giles paused as he turned back to Buffy. He had never seen his
slayer this distraught. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I just hope we aren't too late.&lt;&gt; He thought as he watched the Slayer
try to pull even farther into herself. "Well is there anything I can
do?" he asked, sympathetically. Looking back at Willow and seeing the
signs of pressure the red head was under. </p>

<p>"No, Giles." Willow sighed. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;She looks like she's about to face a firing squad! Well, I guess she's
resigned to having to hurt the person she loves most in the world,
either that or letting her lover get killed.&lt;&gt; Giles' estimation of
Willows strength rose higher. </p>

<p>"All you can do for us is listen." Willow continued sadly. "There is
something I have to tell you." </p>

<p>"No, Wills, please..." Buffy cried out in a tiny wounded voice. "Please
don't do this to me." </p>

<p>Willow went to her hysterical lover, knelt beside her, and pulled her to
her chest. She began rocking Buffy gently stroking her soft golden hair
trying to comfort the hysterical girl. </p>

<p>Giles watched as every time Buffy sobbed Willow would flinch as if she
were being beaten. But the young Witch had on her resolve face so that
even Giles could tell Willow was in as much pain as Buffy. He could also
see that the young witch was determined to do what ever was necessary to
keep her lover safe and alive, no matter how much it hurt Willow to do
it. </p>

<p>"I'm not doing this to you baby. I'm doing this for us." Willow
explained softly into Buffys ear as if comforting a frightened child.
"This is Giles, love, he takes care of us and he protects us. He'd never
ever hurt us. But most of all sweetheart he's like a father to you. He
loves you like you were his own daughter." </p>

<p>"He has to know everything that's happening." the devoted red head
whispered into the Slayers ear. "So he can keep my sweet Slayer alive
for me. I would die if anything happened to you because I didn't tell
him something." </p>

<p>Giles choked on his tears at Willows revelations; he was totally
speechless listening to her opinion of him. He felt a little embarrassed
at witnessing this highly personal exchange between lovers, and more
than a little happy that the witch trusted him so much. </p>

<p>"Please baby let me tell him." Willow whispered into Buffys ear nipping
lightly at the lobe. "I believe in Giles and deep down you do too. I'm
begging you honey let me do this for you." </p>

<p>Giles was about to speak when Buffy nodded her head slowly. </p>

<p>"Go ahead and tell him." Buffy whispered softly. "If you think it's that
important and it will make you happy Wills. I never could deny you
anything." </p>

<p>Willows face lit up and she began kissing Buffys face and neck. </p>

<p>"Thank you, {kiss} thank you {kiss} thank you." Willow said joyfully. "I
know he will help us. I just know he will." </p>

<p>Willow was doing her best to smother Buffy with kisses, so Giles cleared
his throat to remind them he was there before things got out of hand. </p>

<p>"Oh Giles...I...ha...you..." Willow stammered embarrassed. </p>

<p>Buffy giggled at her lovers condition, a sudden mood change after the
decision that further cemented Giles' belief of a mental attack. </p>

<p>"Oh you're gonna so get yours young lady!" Willow told her with a
sexually charged growl. </p>

<p>"Any time you're ready Willow?" Giles said calmly, inwardly amused and
relieved that the girls' good-natured banter had returned. It would make
what he was about to tell them easier. </p>

<p>"I am here for however long you need me." he added with an easy smile.
It was hard not to smile around his girls. </p>

<p>Giles went over and sat on the edge of the bed and, while Willow
continued to hold and comfort her lover, she told Giles everything she
knew about Buffys night terrors. </p>

<p>When she finished Giles took off his glasses and cleaned them (a nervous
habit he had whenever he faced a problem). </p>

<p>"The first thing I think we should clear up is, from what you have told
me and what I have already seen, these are not dreams per say." Giles
said as he replaced his glasses. "My best guess would be that they are
some form of metaphysical attack." </p>

<p>He kept silent as he watched the girls digest this information. At first
neither of them said anything they just stared at the librarian, slack
jawed and wide eyed--then a beatific smile spread over Buffys face. </p>

<p>"That means I'm not insane? Right?" Buffy asked relief evident in her
voice. </p>

<p>"Insane? Good lord Buffy, of course not!" Giles answered. "What ever
gave you that idea?" </p>

<p>"Well... you know...I mean first the dreams wouldn't go away." Buffy
answered subdued. The Englishman noticed Willow starting to stoke her
hair again to calm her. "Then I started waking up in different parts of
the house-with these strange marks and scratches-not knowing how I got
them or got there." </p>

<p>She hid her face behind Willows shoulder. "I kinda figured if you found
out you'd have me locked up in some home for whacked out Slayers or
something like that." </p>

<p>"No one would ever take you away from me! Not ever!" Willow growled
protectively. "I don't care who they are, they will never get you away
from me!" </p>

<p>"It is all right Willow." Giles said to calm the witch, before she could
upset Buffy again. "There will be no taking anyone anywhere and that I
promise you." </p>

<p>The sudden intense look on Willows face made even Giles a little
nervous. In a way he could almost feel sorry for anyone that tried to
come between them. </p>

<p>"All right then, if we have successfully cleared up the sanity matter, I
think it is time we got around to what to do about the attacks and the
ambushes." </p>

<p>Giles paused to see if his two charges had any more to say, when they
said nothing, he continued. "I believe I have come up with a viable plan
of action that will deflect any interference from any outside forces. In
order to do that however it will be necessary to use some methods that
we have never used before." </p>

<p>Once he had the girls undivided attention, Giles outlined his plan and
,although they strenuously objected to some of the methods he wanted to
use, they both saw his point finally and reluctantly agreed to the
overall plan. </p>

<p>While the former watcher and scholar informed his charges that the plan
also called for him to bring in "special" outside help, he flatly
refused to divulge any further information as to the nature of the help,
or who he was calling in. He just told them it was from an unusual
source that was uniquely qualified to handle the situation, but would go
no further. </p>

<p>Giles' only worry was if the two warriors in his care would accept the
assistance, considering the source he couldn't be sure. It was a chance
he had to take. It was his unenviable task to provide for the well being
of the Slayer and her mate from what ever source was available to him,
whether they approved of it or not. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I only hope Willow can control her prejudices long enough for me to
convince Buffy not to hurt them.&lt;&gt; the ex-watcher pondered. &lt;&gt;I just
wish I could tell them the whole truth of the situation, but that just
isn't an option right now.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Once he got the two girls settled down enough to rest for the remainder
of the day, Giles went back to work in his study determined to learn
what the spell that Willow had used in her sleep meant and what really
happened earlier that morning.
Before he realized it the day had passed and it was nearly time for
dinner, he couldn't believe how quickly the day had passed and that
Buffy and Willow had slept most of the day away. </p>

<p>The true miracle was that there had been no outside interruptions and
for the first time in a long long time the girls had actually gotten
some much needed and long deserved sleep. Too bad he had to wake them up
to face life on the Hellmouth once again.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The screaming had stopped, cut off with frightening finality. Within
seconds of the last gurgling scream the door to Countess Helas private
chambers flew open slamming into the wall and the tall exotically erotic
female strolled out of the dimly lit room. Her frustration showed
clearly in her every move and look. </p>

<p>Most of the servants, both human and non-human cringed back into the
shadows trying to avoid her notice. When the Countess was frustrated,
things could get messy if she noticed you. </p>

<p>Her glowing red eyes fell on the one human not trying to hide from her.
A terrifying smile crossed her lips. </p>

<p>The man was a huge heavily muscled Latino. Hela had found him hiding in
an alley, living like an animal, filthy and hungry, and his insanity
openly written on his face and in his behaviour. </p>

<p>As soon as the Demoness saw him in that alley she knew who and what he
was, and knew he would be a perfect servant and pet. </p>

<p>His name was Max that was all; no last name, no nick names, just Max. It
seems that Max had been hiding in that alley because the authorities had
found him out in his native country. The police had been plagued by a
particularly vicious serial killer whose MO was to torture his victims
for several days before dissecting their still living bodies. Still
living bodies of mostly red-headed women, but a blonde would do in a
crunch. </p>

<p>Once in the service of his beloved Countess he became her most loyal and
devoted servant. He refused any reward for his service, he only asked to
do her bidding and be allowed to remain in her presence. </p>

<p>When he saw her eyes on him Max felt a shiver of joy run through his
body. Since the death of Helas favorite demon, Max had taken his place
as the head of her household and her personal playmate. </p>

<p>"Come to me Max." Hela purred smiling at him. "I have need of you my
pet." </p>

<p>Adoration shone in his eyes as he approached her reverently, like a
zealot approaching their god. </p>

<p>"Yes your grace." Maxs voice trembled with emotion. "How may I serve
you?" </p>

<p>She looked down into his adoring eyes and smiled, her razor sharp teeth
and fangs flashing in the flickering light. Hela reached out with a long
taloned finger and traced his jaw, then seeing him shiver in ecstasy at
her touch, she let the finger continue down his neck and across the
well-defined muscles of his chest. ï¿½ </p>

<p>"Take some of these useless louts and have them clean my chambers." Hela
ordered him, never raising her voice above a whisper. "Dispose of the
remains in the usual way, I imagine the dogs are hungry." </p>

<p>"As you wish your grace." he said never taking his eyes off his goddess.
He was in awe of her voracious appetites and wanted desperately to
please her. "Are they ready?" </p>

<p>"Two of them are." she replied off-handedly. "The last one is broken but
she still breathes, these human females are pretty and fun but they have
no stamina. I certainly hope the Slayer is a little more entertaining
than the others of her kind. I can't wait to begin her final training." </p>

<p>The man nodded his agreement then turned and began ordering some of the
lower demons and human servants to join him in the Countess' chambers.
All of them jumped at his commands; they feared him almost as much as
they feared the Countess herself. </p>

<p>The Demoness laughed as a thought entered her mind; she visualized Max
training the witch-kit while the Slayer was forced to watch. Her raucous
maniacal laughter filled the room bringing shivers of fear to those
remaining. </p>

<p>"Oh, and Max." she purred. </p>

<p>"Yes your grace?" he returned instantly. </p>

<p>"Do a good job my pet and I'll find you a new toy." she promised her
psychopathic servant. </p>

<p>With a twisted insane grin on his face, Max turned and hurried to do his
mistress' bidding. </p>

<p>Having finished that portion of her morning business and knowing without
reservation that Max would follow her instructions to the letter, Hela
continued on to her next order of business. </p>

<p>Events of the last few days had placed an unusual drain on her power and
Hela was in serious need of a recharge. </p>

<p>She went across the room to the stone altar that was set up in a
shadowed corner of her 'throne' room. Dipping a finger into a bowl of
blood she'd harvested from her playthings the night before, Hela began
carefully drawing symbols on the alter while chanting ancient formulas
that were old when man first walked on the earth. </p>

<p>Once she finished drawing the necessary symbols and continuing her eerie
chant she ran a razor sharp talon down the inside of her arm opening a
vein. </p>

<p>Allowing her blood to flow over the altar Hela chanted as a sickly
looking red and yellow flame rose from the stone surface it spread out
until it engulfed the Countess. </p>

<p>To her the flames held no heat they were in fact frigid. </p>

<p>The intense cold entered her body filling it with its energy. The fire
on the altar surface slowly died leaving behind a clean unmarked
surface, but Helas entire body was in flames. </p>

<p>The fiery figure stretched and writhed, then she screamed, but not in
pain. From the sounds it was as if she was sexually aroused and the
scream signalled her orgasm. </p>

<p>Slowly the flames faded leaving behind smooth soft flawless skin and
long shining black hair, all signs of fatigue and battle were gone
leaving Hela completely rested and restored. </p>

<p>Holding her arms straight out at shoulder level, Hela threw her head
back and let out an earth shaking howling roar challenging the gods of
light in the name of her own dark deities. </p>

<p>Hela spun around with a flourish and faced the minions that had stayed
to see the ritual and fixed them with her brightly glowing red eyes,
then she slowly allowed a menacing feral smile to cross her lips. </p>

<p>"Now back to our little Slayer and her precious witch-kit." Hela growled
evilly. "I will have them and I will be rid of that bastard Kresis." </p>

<p>No one doubted her for a minute. </p>
