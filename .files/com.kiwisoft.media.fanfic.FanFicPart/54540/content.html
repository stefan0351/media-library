<p>Giles had just finished patrolling. When the sun had gone down and the
girls hadn't woken up, he decided to let them sleep while he made a
sweep. </p>

<p>After the thwarted attack on Buffy that morning, he had spent the rest
of the day watching over them and thinking about a plan. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I only hope they are willing to go along with it.&lt;&gt; Giles thought.
&lt;&gt;This is the first time I've called in outside help without their
consent, but I have no choice.&lt;&gt;
He kept up the mental dialogue all the way home. &lt;&gt;Anyone that can worm
their way through Willows defences and so thoroughly attack Buffy was a
formidable foe. The type of the attack also spoke volumes about the kind
of Magician that was behind it.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>By the time he walked into the door he was certain that his plan was the
only way to save the girls-from what he still wasn't sure-but he was
sure of the danger they were in. </p>

<p>"Buffy, Willow?" He called, when he didn't find them on the couch. He
felt a brief surge of panic at their absence and decided to call them at
their apartment next door inspite of the late hour. But, as he entered
the hallway Giles heard the raised voices of a heated argument. </p>

<p>"Willow you can't! You promised!" Buffys voice easily carried thorough
the closed door of his spare bedroom. "He'll tell mom...t-they'll h-hate
m-me! Or he will think I'm ready to be put away!" </p>

<p>The sound of her sobbing plea tore at the ex-Watchers heart, and made
him wonder what could possibly be so bad that Joyce might hate her for
it. Then he realized, nothing. Buffy wasn't thinking clearly. </p>

<p>"Buffy honey, don't cry." he heard Willow say as he reached up to knock
on the door. "We have to tell him so he can help us, Giles could never
hate you." </p>

<p>Giles could hear the near hysteria in Willows voice. Hoping that what he
had to say would allay their fears, Giles knocked lightly on the door.
Instantly, Buffys crying stopped. </p>

<p>"Yeah?" Willow called out. "Is that you Giles?" </p>

<p>"Yes, are you clothed?" He asked. "I believe we need to talk." </p>

<p>"I bet." he heard Buffy say sarcastically. "He's probably been snooping
around out there spying on us." </p>

<p>"Buffy please!" Willow hissed, embarrassed by her companions rude
remark. Then she called out "Come on in Giles." </p>

<p>He cautiously stepped through the door. Looking around he saw Buffy
sitting on the floor facing a corner hugging her knees. Her body was
shaking as she tried to hide her sobbing from him. </p>

<p>Willow was sitting on the edge of the bed; her entire body ridged with
tension and her eyes were red and puffy and locked on Buffy. Giles could
see the trails left by the young witchs tears. He surmised the argument
had been going on for some time before he arrived. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry if we disturbed you, Giles." Willow said softly her voice
trembling with emotion, her eyes never leaving her lover. "There seems
to be a minor break down in communications." </p>

<p>"I see." Giles paused as he turned back to Buffy. He had never seen his
slayer this distraught. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I just hope we aren't too late.&lt;&gt; He thought as he watched the Slayer
try to pull even farther into herself. "Well is there anything I can
do?" he asked, sympathetically. Looking back at Willow and seeing the
signs of pressure the red head was under. </p>

<p>"No, Giles." Willow sighed. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;She looks like she's about to face a firing squad! Well, I guess she's
resigned to having to hurt the person she loves most in the world,
either that or letting her lover get killed.&lt;&gt; Giles' estimation of
Willows strength rose higher. </p>

<p>"All you can do for us is listen." Willow continued sadly. "There is
something I have to tell you." </p>

<p>"No, Wills, please..." Buffy cried out in a tiny wounded voice. "Please
don't do this to me." </p>

<p>Willow went to her hysterical lover, knelt beside her, and pulled her to
her chest. She began rocking Buffy gently stroking her soft golden hair
trying to comfort the hysterical girl. </p>

<p>Giles watched as every time Buffy sobbed Willow would flinch as if she
were being beaten. But the young Witch had on her resolve face so that
even Giles could tell Willow was in as much pain as Buffy. He could also
see that the young witch was determined to do what ever was necessary to
keep her lover safe and alive, no matter how much it hurt Willow to do
it. </p>

<p>"I'm not doing this to you baby. I'm doing this for us." Willow
explained softly into Buffys ear as if comforting a frightened child.
"This is Giles, love, he takes care of us and he protects us. He'd never
ever hurt us. But most of all sweetheart he's like a father to you. He
loves you like you were his own daughter." </p>

<p>"He has to know everything that's happening." the devoted red head
whispered into the Slayers ear. "So he can keep my sweet Slayer alive
for me. I would die if anything happened to you because I didn't tell
him something." </p>

<p>Giles choked on his tears at Willows revelations; he was totally
speechless listening to her opinion of him. He felt a little embarrassed
at witnessing this highly personal exchange between lovers, and more
than a little happy that the witch trusted him so much. </p>

<p>"Please baby let me tell him." Willow whispered into Buffys ear nipping
lightly at the lobe. "I believe in Giles and deep down you do too. I'm
begging you honey let me do this for you." </p>

<p>Giles was about to speak when Buffy nodded her head slowly. </p>

<p>"Go ahead and tell him." Buffy whispered softly. "If you think it's that
important and it will make you happy Wills. I never could deny you
anything." </p>

<p>Willows face lit up and she began kissing Buffys face and neck. </p>

<p>"Thank you, {kiss} thank you {kiss} thank you." Willow said joyfully. "I
know he will help us. I just know he will." </p>

<p>Willow was doing her best to smother Buffy with kisses, so Giles cleared
his throat to remind them he was there before things got out of hand. </p>

<p>"Oh Giles...I...ha...you..." Willow stammered embarrassed. </p>

<p>Buffy giggled at her lovers condition, a sudden mood change after the
decision that further cemented Giles' belief of a mental attack. </p>

<p>"Oh you're gonna so get yours young lady!" Willow told her with a
sexually charged growl. </p>

<p>"Any time you're ready Willow?" Giles said calmly, inwardly amused and
relieved that the girls' good-natured banter had returned. It would make
what he was about to tell them easier. </p>

<p>"I am here for however long you need me." he added with an easy smile.
It was hard not to smile around his girls. </p>

<p>Giles went over and sat on the edge of the bed and, while Willow
continued to hold and comfort her lover, she told Giles everything she
knew about Buffys night terrors. </p>

<p>When she finished Giles took off his glasses and cleaned them (a nervous
habit he had whenever he faced a problem). </p>

<p>"The first thing I think we should clear up is, from what you have told
me and what I have already seen, these are not dreams per say." Giles
said as he replaced his glasses. "My best guess would be that they are
some form of metaphysical attack." </p>

<p>He kept silent as he watched the girls digest this information. At first
neither of them said anything they just stared at the librarian, slack
jawed and wide eyed--then a beatific smile spread over Buffys face. </p>

<p>"That means I'm not insane? Right?" Buffy asked relief evident in her
voice. </p>

<p>"Insane? Good lord Buffy, of course not!" Giles answered. "What ever
gave you that idea?" </p>

<p>"Well... you know...I mean first the dreams wouldn't go away." Buffy
answered subdued. The Englishman noticed Willow starting to stoke her
hair again to calm her. "Then I started waking up in different parts of
the house-with these strange marks and scratches-not knowing how I got
them or got there." </p>

<p>She hid her face behind Willows shoulder. "I kinda figured if you found
out you'd have me locked up in some home for whacked out Slayers or
something like that." </p>

<p>"No one would ever take you away from me! Not ever!" Willow growled
protectively. "I don't care who they are, they will never get you away
from me!" </p>

<p>"It is all right Willow." Giles said to calm the witch, before she could
upset Buffy again. "There will be no taking anyone anywhere and that I
promise you." </p>

<p>The sudden intense look on Willows face made even Giles a little
nervous. In a way he could almost feel sorry for anyone that tried to
come between them. </p>

<p>"All right then, if we have successfully cleared up the sanity matter, I
think it is time we got around to what to do about the attacks and the
ambushes." </p>

<p>Giles paused to see if his two charges had any more to say, when they
said nothing, he continued. "I believe I have come up with a viable plan
of action that will deflect any interference from any outside forces. In
order to do that however it will be necessary to use some methods that
we have never used before." </p>

<p>Once he had the girls undivided attention, Giles outlined his plan and
,although they strenuously objected to some of the methods he wanted to
use, they both saw his point finally and reluctantly agreed to the
overall plan. </p>

<p>While the former watcher and scholar informed his charges that the plan
also called for him to bring in "special" outside help, he flatly
refused to divulge any further information as to the nature of the help,
or who he was calling in. He just told them it was from an unusual
source that was uniquely qualified to handle the situation, but would go
no further. </p>

<p>Giles' only worry was if the two warriors in his care would accept the
assistance, considering the source he couldn't be sure. It was a chance
he had to take. It was his unenviable task to provide for the well being
of the Slayer and her mate from what ever source was available to him,
whether they approved of it or not. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I only hope Willow can control her prejudices long enough for me to
convince Buffy not to hurt them.&lt;&gt; the ex-watcher pondered. &lt;&gt;I just
wish I could tell them the whole truth of the situation, but that just
isn't an option right now.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Once he got the two girls settled down enough to rest for the remainder
of the day, Giles went back to work in his study determined to learn
what the spell that Willow had used in her sleep meant and what really
happened earlier that morning.
Before he realized it the day had passed and it was nearly time for
dinner, he couldn't believe how quickly the day had passed and that
Buffy and Willow had slept most of the day away. </p>

<p>The true miracle was that there had been no outside interruptions and
for the first time in a long long time the girls had actually gotten
some much needed and long deserved sleep. Too bad he had to wake them up
to face life on the Hellmouth once again.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The screaming had stopped, cut off with frightening finality. Within
seconds of the last gurgling scream the door to Countess Helas private
chambers flew open slamming into the wall and the tall exotically erotic
female strolled out of the dimly lit room. Her frustration showed
clearly in her every move and look. </p>

<p>Most of the servants, both human and non-human cringed back into the
shadows trying to avoid her notice. When the Countess was frustrated,
things could get messy if she noticed you. </p>

<p>Her glowing red eyes fell on the one human not trying to hide from her.
A terrifying smile crossed her lips. </p>

<p>The man was a huge heavily muscled Latino. Hela had found him hiding in
an alley, living like an animal, filthy and hungry, and his insanity
openly written on his face and in his behaviour. </p>

<p>As soon as the Demoness saw him in that alley she knew who and what he
was, and knew he would be a perfect servant and pet. </p>

<p>His name was Max that was all; no last name, no nick names, just Max. It
seems that Max had been hiding in that alley because the authorities had
found him out in his native country. The police had been plagued by a
particularly vicious serial killer whose MO was to torture his victims
for several days before dissecting their still living bodies. Still
living bodies of mostly red-headed women, but a blonde would do in a
crunch. </p>

<p>Once in the service of his beloved Countess he became her most loyal and
devoted servant. He refused any reward for his service, he only asked to
do her bidding and be allowed to remain in her presence. </p>

<p>When he saw her eyes on him Max felt a shiver of joy run through his
body. Since the death of Helas favorite demon, Max had taken his place
as the head of her household and her personal playmate. </p>

<p>"Come to me Max." Hela purred smiling at him. "I have need of you my
pet." </p>

<p>Adoration shone in his eyes as he approached her reverently, like a
zealot approaching their god. </p>

<p>"Yes your grace." Maxs voice trembled with emotion. "How may I serve
you?" </p>

<p>She looked down into his adoring eyes and smiled, her razor sharp teeth
and fangs flashing in the flickering light. Hela reached out with a long
taloned finger and traced his jaw, then seeing him shiver in ecstasy at
her touch, she let the finger continue down his neck and across the
well-defined muscles of his chest.   </p>

<p>"Take some of these useless louts and have them clean my chambers." Hela
ordered him, never raising her voice above a whisper. "Dispose of the
remains in the usual way, I imagine the dogs are hungry." </p>

<p>"As you wish your grace." he said never taking his eyes off his goddess.
He was in awe of her voracious appetites and wanted desperately to
please her. "Are they ready?" </p>

<p>"Two of them are." she replied off-handedly. "The last one is broken but
she still breathes, these human females are pretty and fun but they have
no stamina. I certainly hope the Slayer is a little more entertaining
than the others of her kind. I can't wait to begin her final training." </p>

<p>The man nodded his agreement then turned and began ordering some of the
lower demons and human servants to join him in the Countess' chambers.
All of them jumped at his commands; they feared him almost as much as
they feared the Countess herself. </p>

<p>The Demoness laughed as a thought entered her mind; she visualized Max
training the witch-kit while the Slayer was forced to watch. Her raucous
maniacal laughter filled the room bringing shivers of fear to those
remaining. </p>

<p>"Oh, and Max." she purred. </p>

<p>"Yes your grace?" he returned instantly. </p>

<p>"Do a good job my pet and I'll find you a new toy." she promised her
psychopathic servant. </p>

<p>With a twisted insane grin on his face, Max turned and hurried to do his
mistress' bidding. </p>

<p>Having finished that portion of her morning business and knowing without
reservation that Max would follow her instructions to the letter, Hela
continued on to her next order of business. </p>

<p>Events of the last few days had placed an unusual drain on her power and
Hela was in serious need of a recharge. </p>

<p>She went across the room to the stone altar that was set up in a
shadowed corner of her 'throne' room. Dipping a finger into a bowl of
blood she'd harvested from her playthings the night before, Hela began
carefully drawing symbols on the alter while chanting ancient formulas
that were old when man first walked on the earth. </p>

<p>Once she finished drawing the necessary symbols and continuing her eerie
chant she ran a razor sharp talon down the inside of her arm opening a
vein. </p>

<p>Allowing her blood to flow over the altar Hela chanted as a sickly
looking red and yellow flame rose from the stone surface it spread out
until it engulfed the Countess. </p>

<p>To her the flames held no heat they were in fact frigid. </p>

<p>The intense cold entered her body filling it with its energy. The fire
on the altar surface slowly died leaving behind a clean unmarked
surface, but Helas entire body was in flames. </p>

<p>The fiery figure stretched and writhed, then she screamed, but not in
pain. From the sounds it was as if she was sexually aroused and the
scream signalled her orgasm. </p>

<p>Slowly the flames faded leaving behind smooth soft flawless skin and
long shining black hair, all signs of fatigue and battle were gone
leaving Hela completely rested and restored. </p>

<p>Holding her arms straight out at shoulder level, Hela threw her head
back and let out an earth shaking howling roar challenging the gods of
light in the name of her own dark deities. </p>

<p>Hela spun around with a flourish and faced the minions that had stayed
to see the ritual and fixed them with her brightly glowing red eyes,
then she slowly allowed a menacing feral smile to cross her lips. </p>

<p>"Now back to our little Slayer and her precious witch-kit." Hela growled
evilly. "I will have them and I will be rid of that bastard Kresis." </p>

<p>No one doubted her for a minute. </p>

<p>The sleek black Lear jet glided easily out of the gun-metal grey sky and
landed smoothly at the small private airstrip just outside Sunnydale. It
taxied directly to a large hanger that sat away from the other
buildings. </p>

<p>The only break in the planes shining black exterior were the white
"call" letters required by international laws and the crossed gold keys
of the Vatican.
It sat all alone on the tarmac like some solitary bird of prey. </p>

<p>No one moved toward the plane and there was no movement from inside the
curious aircraft. A long black limousine pulled into the airstrip
driving onto the tarmac heading directly to the waiting private jet. It
came to a halt next to the plane and the planes passenger door opened. </p>

<p>A chauffeur got out of the limo and hurried to the rear door closest to
the plane, opening it then turning to look expectantly toward the plane.
Three men, in long black coats and black hats with wide flat brims that
partially hid their faces, got out of the aircraft and headed straight
to the limo. </p>

<p>The first two entered the car with only a slight nod of acknowledgment
to the driver. The third stopped and held out his hand to the nervous
young man who immediately knelt down and kissed the large ring on the
mans finger. </p>

<p>"Welcome your eminence." the driver said reverently as he stood up. </p>

<p>"Thank you Brother Jeffrey." the man said his voice soft and deep, with
a middle European accent. "You know where we need to go and please in
this capacity I am a simple Abbot, nothing more." </p>

<p>"As you wish father." the driver answered. "If you wish we can go
straight there now." </p>

<p>"Fine, brother Jeffrey, fine." the man said placing a hand on the eager
younger mans shoulder and giving it a friendly squeeze. "You are
efficient and prepared as always my son, which is why you were chosen
for this particular mission. Our order is pleased and proud of the way
you have handled this difficult and unusual task." </p>

<p>The driver blushed slightly at the praise from his revered superior. He
mumbled his thanks and after the man was in the limo he shut the door
securely and hurried and slid into the drivers seat. </p>

<p>The limo swiftly and silently left the airstrip and smoothly onto the
road headed toward Sunnydale.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The last crimson rays of sunset faded from the sky, surrendering to the
black velvet blanket of night. The Slayer sat on the couch between her
lovers legs, leaning back into Willow using her for a back rest. </p>

<p>Willow had her arms wrapped around Buffy, enjoying the feel of her lover
against her and feeling her warmth even through their clothing. The
witch rested her chin on top of the Slayers blonde head, leaning down
every once to whisper some random lovers secret in Buffys ear causing
her to shiver with delight. </p>

<p>This was the first time in weeks either of them had been this relaxed,
even though they both knew they'd soon be facing one of the most
dangerous enemies any of them had ever faced. </p>

<p>The revelations of earlier in the day, along with Giles plan slowly
coming together had gone a long way toward normalizing their emotions.
Even though they knew that when they made it past this night they still
faced two of the most important days of their young lives they were
positive they could get through it together. </p>

<p>Both Willow and Buffy knew that one of the smartest decisions they'd
made was putting Cordelia in charge of the wedding arrangements. They
were amazed and proud of the way Cordy had handled it all and was still
on speaking terms with both of their mothers. In their eyes their friend
was a miracle worker. </p>

<p>Being an indispensable part of Giles' plan, Xander and Cordy 'the
Miracle Worker' had arrived earlier and had already been briefed on what
they were expected to do during the nights activities. They already had
chosen the weapons necessary to the tasks. </p>

<p>Willow had pulled her life long friend aside and given him some
"special" instructions about the others involved in the plan. Xander let
Willow know he completely understood and he had no problem what so ever
doing as she asked. </p>

<p>Now the young lovers were sharing one of Giles overstuffed easy chairs.
Cordelia was on Xanders lap her legs draped over, one arm her arms
wrapped around his neck. They were now engaged in a passionate kiss
after several minutes gazing into each others eyes or as Cordelia once
put it, looking all gooey eyed at each other. </p>

<p>Giles came out of the kitchen with his cup of freshly brewed Earl Grey
and frowned slightly at the sight of the two couples open displays of
affection in his living room. </p>

<p>"I feel like I'm living in some sort of teenage brothel." he said
shaking his head and chuckling softly. </p>

<p>"What's the matter G-man, jealous?" quipped Xander, causing the three
girls to laugh at the thought. </p>

<p>"That, my dear Xander, is not the point." Giles grumbled at the laughter
at his expense. </p>

<p>"Somebody is certainly Mr. Cranky this evening." Willow scolded the
ex-Watcher.
"This is just the logical expression of one persons love for another. So
there!" </p>

<p>The red head stuck her tongue out at the complaining man causing her
lover to giggle causing Giles further frustration. </p>

<p>Then he suddenly laughed at himself when he realized what he must sound
like. "Dear lord." he mused. "I sound like my father." </p>

<p>Before he could make any further revelations he was interrupted by a
knock at the front door. </p>

<p>"Must be a guest." he mumbled as he left the room. "I don't think I know
anyone that has the courtesy to knock any more." </p>

<p>Giles returned quickly with a man that looked very familiar to Willow.
Buffy felt her lovers body become ridged with tension and moved so she
could see Willows face trying to determine the problem. </p>

<p>The sight caused Buffy to slide over to the far end of the couch. </p>

<p>Willows normally open loving and compassionate face had been replaced by
a hard, suspicious, angry, glaring one. Her eyes seemed to radiate a
pulsating green glow, that was apparently aimed at the man that just
entered with Giles. </p>

<p>"What is it sweetheart?" Buffy asked concerned by her lovers sudden
change and a little frightened. "What the matter?" </p>

<p>"Why is HE here, Giles?" the witch snarled not bothering to hide her
anger and distrust of the man's presence. "No one here is ill or
requires the services of this 'doctor'." </p>

<p>"You know why I'm here, young one." the man said softly before Giles
could say anything. </p>

<p>Willow and the man stared at each other, everybody was looking first at
Giles then at Willow then at the newcomer then back to Giles searching
for some explanation for their friends strangely hostile behaviour. </p>

<p>"Who is this Giles?" Buffy asked, rising from the couch disturbed by
Willows uncharacteristic behaviour. </p>

<p>"I doubt if you remember Buffy." Giles answered eyeing Willow. "This man
is the doctor that tried to help you during your recent illness. This is
Dr. Jeffrey Fallon." </p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you doctor." Buffy said holding out her hand. </p>

<p>"NO!" Willow barked angrily. </p>

<p>Buffy stopped and looked at her obviously very upset friend. She started
to ask why she was being so rude when three more men entered the room. </p>

<p>Buffys attention was drawn away by a low menacing growl coming from her
lover as the three strangely dressed men came in. She was shocked by the
hostility that Willow gave off in waves. </p>

<p>Buffy could tell the young witch was bristling with fury, apparently
caused by the newcomers. </p>

<p>"What is your purpose here priest?" Willow snarled challengingly. "Come
to murder my soulmate and I, like your pious forefathers did our sisters
just a few centuries ago?" </p>

<p>The glow from Willows eyes seemed to spread out, first around Willow
herself, then it expanded to engulf her other half. </p>

<p>Everyone else in the room wisely moved back out of the line of fire,
surprised by their normally sweet even tempered friends sudden display
of hostility and power. </p>

<p>Giles stepped up and started to speak but was stopped by the raised hand
of the shortest and oldest of the newcomers. </p>

<p>"You are the one that found and destroyed our hidden archives." the man
stated as fact not a question with a slight sad smile. "Do not interfere
Watcher, knowing what she read in those files she has every reason not
to trust any of our calling." </p>

<p>"Why..ARE..you..here..PRIEST?" Willow spat out each word like a curse. </p>

<p>"Be calmed Sorceress." the man said. "We are here to help you and to
attempt to atone for a grievous error in judgment made by a misinformed
church because of untruths given her by certain over zealous, over
ambitious and yes even envious men that misrepresented the facts over
one thousand years ago." </p>

<p>Willow snorted in anger. </p>

<p>"Your kind slaughtered an entire class of women whose only sin was to
love each other and be warriors of the light." Willow stated, her
contempt dripped from her voice like venom. "How do you plan to atone
for their lives, how do you plan to justify your betrayal of their
innocent souls." </p>

<p>"Willow really." Giles said trying to stop her recriminations. "They are
here to help after all. You knew this, we discussed it." </p>

<p>"The Sorceress speaks her heart Watcher." The man said. "Her suspicions
are well founded." </p>

<p>"But your emin...." Jeffrey Fallon tried to protest but was stopped by
the
older man. </p>

<p>"Please, Brother Jeffrey, we discussed this." he scolded softly. "on
this mission I am a simple Abbot." </p>

<p>"You think to hide your true self from me priest?" Willow asked
sarcastically. "Why if not to hide your true intentions?" </p>

<p>"Not from you Sorceress." the abbot said his middle European accent
becoming more pronounced as he spoke. "But from others less dedicated to
our mission. The Darkness has its allies everywhere." </p>

<p>This revelation brought a heavy silence to the room. Willow faced the
newcomers, her attention focused on the Abbot, searching his face for
any hint of deception. The pulsating green aura swirled and glowed
around both Buffy and Willow shielding the lovers from any attempt at
treachery. </p>

<p>"We have known that once a Slayer and her Sorceress were together on the
Hellmouth, the joining of their souls would eventually occur." the Abbot
explained. "And with that joining would come the rebirth of the Sisters.
As part of the Church's commitment our order was formed to watch over
the two of you when the time came and provide what ever assistance we
could." </p>

<p>"At first we hoped that Brother Jeffreys treating of the Slayers illness
would be all that would be required." his explanation continued. "But
circumstances have arisen that have caused us to take a more active role
in your joining. This joining was destined to happen and according to
terms created before the age of man the joining was considered sacred
and was deemed inviolate by both sides. Apparently someone on the side
of darkness has taken it upon themselves to violate the agreement and
interfere. This being is powerful and has a limited number of extremely
powerful allies, those however are nearly depleted. There will be no
reinforcement so they are desperate.
So now by the powers given us by God through the Holy Father in Rome, we
have left another office we hold in the church to return to our first
and foremost duty, as Brother warriors in the war against the dark and
to insure the your joining in the manner of the ancient Celtic sect
known as the Sisters of the Soul and in the name of the church to
welcome that sect as allies in our continuing war for universal
balance." </p>

<p>"Pretty words priest." Willow growled, conceding reluctantly. "But given
the track record of your kind, I'm sure you'll forgive me for not
trusting you completely. As you know both the Slayer and I are sworn not
to take a human life, our friends however have no such limitations." </p>

<p>She looked at Xander and when their eyes met Willow nodded slightly and
Xander smiled coldly. </p>

<p>"No prob Will." Xander said as he turned a hard humorless smile on the
clerics and hefted a 9mm automatic that appeared almost magically in his
hand. "No one will get a shot at your back." </p>

<p>The eerie green glow now enveloped all four young people. This
development caused a debate among the clerics, that was soon interrupted
by Willow. </p>

<p>"If you are truly here to help us priest, then we'll gladly accept." the
witch said her voice soft and clear while showing the iron in her words.
"But if you are contemplating treachery then as you can see we are
prepared to deal with it. We have no time for subtleties and
negotiations, no talks no compromises. Tonight is all or nothing." </p>

<p>Seeing the fiercely protective look in Xanders hard dark eyes and
hearing the calm confidence in Willows voice, and the determined looks
on all of the young peoples faces, Giles knew that they were not
bluffing. </p>

<p>He felt a deep sense of pride of the loyalty they displayed, but a cold
chill ran down his spine at the easy manner that Xander displayed in his
willingness to defend his friends, even to the point of murder. </p>

<p>"You seem to inspire great loyalty, Sorceress." the Abbot commented.
"That speaks well of you, but right now if we can, I need to speak
privately to you, the Slayer, and your Watcher." </p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 13</td></tr>
</table>

<p>"Is there somewhere that we can speak?" the Abbot asked. "I do not wish
to be rude, but there are some things that are only for the three of you
can divulge to anyone else." </p>

<p>"Of course Abbot." Giles said indicating the door to his study. "We can
speak in my study. I'm sure everyone can calm themselves enough for
that." </p>

<p>The Abbot followed Giles with a very wary Willow and Buffy not far
behind. The girls sat together on the love seat, while Giles sat in a
large overstuffed easy chair, turning his desk and chair over to the
Abbot. </p>

<p>The older man laid a large wooden case on the desk. Buffy studied the
case and was fascinated by the intricately carved and obviously ancient
case and wondered what it could possibly contain of interest to them. </p>

<p>She knew that Willow wasn't comfortable with these people and so she was
naturally suspicious because her friend was the one that saw the good in
every one. If her Wills didn't trust these guys than Buffy resolved that
she'd watch their every move. </p>

<p>The Abbot sat back in the comfortable desk chair and let out a heavy
sigh of both relief and exhaustion. </p>

<p>"I am getting too old for this." the elderly cleric said smiling wearily
at Giles. "This running around the world is a young persons game. I am
only glad to have lived long enough to see the culmination of my lifes
dream and to finally be able to carry out the duties of my office of
Abbot."
"What's your dreams and duties got to do with me and Wills?" Buffy asked
not sure she wanted the answer. </p>

<p>"You Slayer." the Abbot said locking eyes with the young blonde. "You
and your beloved little witch are my lifes work. It's what I and my
predecessors have lived and worked secretly for over three hundred
years.
Our duty is to help the Slayer and the Sorceress fulfil their destiny
and, God willing, begin to pay back a debt long past due." </p>

<p>He paused for a moment to be sure he had the attention of everyone in
the room before continuing. </p>

<p>"You must understand when the errors of our predecessors were
discovered, the Holy Father at the time was appalled and was determined
to make it right." the Abbots deep slightly accented voice helped his
listeners to relax and absorb his narrative. "In an effort to see that
the Church and its representatives did their duty, that Pope and every
one since has maintained a secret order of a few dedicated individuals
to gather, keep, and preserve all the records, legends, and artifacts we
could gather pertaining to the Sisters and keep them in trust for this
time.
Over the generations our brothers have searched and waited keeping an
eye on the Watchers Council and their Slayers knowing it was only a
matter of time until the Slayer and her Sorceress of their time would be
joined, thus renewing the ancient sect.
Many times it came close but the Slayer usually died before destiny
could join her with her Sorceress. It was as if someone or something was
trying to kill them off to keep destiny from joining.
When it was reported that the two of you had met early and when we
learned this Slayer had lived past her 18th birthday we were further
encouraged because you my dear are the first to do so and it appears
that you are truly destiny's chosen ones." </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow looked at each other and gasped in awe at what they'd
just learned and the ramifications it carried. For the first time they
realized that Buffy and Willow were the Chosen Ones, not just Buffy.
They both were relieved that now some of the weight destiny had placed
on Buffys shoulders would now be shared by the two of them. </p>

<p>Buffy knew that for the first since becoming the Slayer she was never
going to be alone again. With his words the Abbot had confirmed
everything they had learned from Brigit and Morrigan. It really was
destiny that brought them together. </p>

<p>Not everyone was relieved by the Abbots words, everything that Giles
knew and believed was shaken to the core by the truth revealed by the
Abbots history lessons. Giles knew the rest of the truth behind the
failure of the Slayers' premature deaths, and he knew why his Slayer was
the exception. </p>

<p>"The test." Giles whispered, horrified by his revelation and the
treachery of his own organization. "Those bastards were so afraid of
losing their control over the Slayers they murdered them so they
couldn't be joined and become independent.
If I had followed orders blindly like the rest they would have made me
an accomplice in Buffys murder.
All their high and mighty talk and the marvellous ideals they preached,
all CRAP!" </p>

<p>Giles slammed his fist down on the desk as he roared those last words.
He leapt from his chair and began pacing the floor of his study. His
rage was becoming a living thing feeding on his outrage and grief as his
world fell apart around him. </p>

<p>Before he'd thought that only a few individuals were responsible for the
problems and inconsistences he'd come across, but now he knew the entire
council was corrupt from its very foundations. </p>

<p>He was lost. For the first time in his life he questioned his reasons
for living. As if reading his mind Willow reached out and caught the
agitated man as he past her. </p>

<p>She pulled him over to stand in front of her and Buffy and waited until
he looked into her eyes, then she began to comfort the man she had come
to consider a father to herself and the person she loved most in the
world. </p>

<p>"Giles please don't blame yourself." Willow said her voice soft and
warm, wrapping around his raging spirit like a comforting blanket and
stilling his anger. "You are the finest most honorable man we've ever
known. You have always dealt fairly and honestly with all of us, and
more importantly you have always followed your conscience even, when it
cost you dearly. You've always put Buffy and her welfare ahead of
everything else.
When the council tried to set her up and ordered you to drug her you did
everything you could to thwart them. You are the single most important
reason my Buffy is alive to be with me today.
For that alone how can we help but love you and forgive any mistakes you
may have made because you trusted men who lied and manipulated you." </p>

<p>"Yeah Giles-y, what she said." Buffy said trying to lighten the mood. "I
mean it's like your my Dad, and what Dad hasn't screwed up raising their
kid because they listened to some idiot that tried to tell them how to
do their job. So do what other dads do.
Admit your mistake, say you're sorry and GET OVER IT! So deal okay.
Now I think the Abbot-guy has some more to tell us and I don't think I
got time. Remember I'm gettin' married tomorrow and the little spitfire
I'm gettin' hitched to isn't gonna take any excuses from you or me for
being late." </p>

<p>Giles looked down at the two girls and was overcome with emotion. He
fell to his knees and hugged both of them. Then realizing what he was
doing he blushed at his lack of control. </p>

<p>He straightened up removed his glasses and began cleaning them as he
went back to his seat. </p>

<p>"You are quite correct Buffy." the Watcher said. "I am sorry for the
interruption, please continue father, it won't happen again." </p>

<p>The Abbot sat quietly for a moment reflecting on what Giles had said and
the trust displayed by the two girls. He was more than a little
surprised at the closeness shared by these three and was glad that they
had each other. His studies and experiences had shown him how important
that could be. </p>

<p>"What you say about the Watchers Council would explain much." the Abbot
said as he absorbed the gist of what had been said. "It would also
explain their very active role in the witch hunts." </p>

<p>"I hope you wouldn't try to divert attention from the role your own
people played in the atrocities during the Burning Times priest." Willow
snapped sarcastically. "I imagine they simply followed your example,
they just never stopped. They do however have valid reasons to fear the
Sorceress. When we have time I'm sure we'll get around to what to do
about the council and their role in all this." </p>

<p>That statement left the room with an ominous silence until the full
impact of what had been said hit Buffy like a ton of bricks. </p>

<p>"Okay you mean that the reason the Council tried to get me killed was to
keep me and Wills from getting together." Buffy blurted out suddenly
outraged. "Why those...those...those not nice guys...they...I ought
to...that's just...that's just about the funniest thing I ever heard." </p>

<p>Buffy started laughing so hard it hurt and tears were streaming from her
eyes, then she noticed that the others were looking at her like she'd
lost her mind. Buffy straightened up and tried to explain. </p>

<p>"I just thought about all the sneakiness and hateful things they've done
to us, just to keep me and Wills apart. All they did was bring us closer
together, and drive a good man away from them, and give me a Dad." Buffy
smiled mischievously at the two people. "Oh boy I bet someone is really
pissed at somebody for that foul up. I suppose when this is over we
really should send the Council a note of thanks for helping us get
together.
What do ya' say Wills, you want to write it or should I?" </p>

<p>Willow broke out laughing at the thought of the look on the faces of the
council when they received that particular piece of correspondence. When
she shared her thoughts with the ex-Watcher he too had to chuckle and
asked to help compose it, which caused all three of them to break out in
laughter again. </p>

<p>The Abbot watched the easy and natural camaraderie displayed by the
Watcher and his two charges. Being in his position he knew how rare and
valuable such closeness was when facing the unknown dangers these people
shared every day. </p>

<p>He hated to interrupt but he had a lot to take care of and limited time
in which to do it. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt but I really must get this done before we leave
for the confrontation we face tonight." the Abbot sighed. Then he sat up
and, after pushing some hidden latches on the wooden case, the Abbot
opened it. "As we are instructed by prophecy when the Slayer and the
Sorceress come together, the artifacts gathered in their names shall be
returned to them, so I believe these belong to you."
He turned the open case around to show its contents to the two girls.
Buffy and Willow craned their necks to see into the case and gaped at
what they saw. </p>

<p>The case contained a large collection of wood, crystal, and silver items
along with some well maintained leather gauntlets with long sharp silver
spikes. </p>

<p>They could feel the power and history of the items calling to them.
There were also several sealed bottles and vials of powders and liquids
that radiated their metaphysical strength, even Giles could feel the
power that was contained in the case the Abbot had just presented to the
girls. </p>

<p>"I am not an expert in the meanings and uses of all of these items, that
is Jeffreys area of expertise." the Abbot explained as he picked up two
amulets on silver chains. "These two however I have reserved to give to
you myself, as has every one that has held my office." </p>

<p>He walked around the desk to the love seat where the two girls sat
watching him intently. The first amulet was a crystal and silver swan. </p>

<p>This one he handed to Willow as she held it the amulet took on a
pulsating green light that pulsed in time with the young witchs
heartbeat. </p>

<p>"This is for you to give to your beloved." he told her his voice
reflecting the reverence and respect he had for the small ceremony that
was about to take place. "It is the symbol of your love and commitment
to her and a token of your promise to protect her always and to remain
at her side to share her joys and sorrows for the span of your lives." </p>

<p>Willow locked eyes with the old priest and she could see the deep
emotion he was feeling and finally understood the true meaning behind
his actions. He was truly happy for the two girls and was giving their
union the closest thing to a blessing the tenets of his religion would
allow. </p>

<p>She smiled up at him and nodded her consent as a single tear fell down
her cheek. </p>

<p>The old man turned to Buffy and put a delicate looking crystal rose
amulet in her hand, it was soon glowing with a bluish white light that
pulsed in time with the Slayer's heartbeat. </p>

<p>"Since the beginning of know records, the single white rose has been the
symbol of the Slayer." he began. Buffy and Willow gasped when they
realized that Buffy had always favored white roses. "This is for you to
give to your beloved Sorceress as a symbol of your love and commitment
and a token of your vow to protect and cultivate her soul.
It also is a notice to all creatures that she is the mate of the Slayer
that to assault her is to incur the wrath of the Slayer, something even
the most powerful minions of the dark would think twice about." </p>

<p>"Thank you." Buffy whispered, in awe of what the old Abbot had just told
her. </p>

<p>"Over the years I have found that love and trust like you two have for
each other is a rare and precious find where ever you find it." the
Abbot told the girls seriously. "Many of my own colleagues would
disagree with me even to the point of condemnation and excommunication.
Even the Church can not publicly support you. Privately however is
another story. Before we leave this place both you and your watcher will
be given several diverse methods of contacting our order. We are
authorized to provide with any and all the support you need, all the
resources of the Church are available to us.
Then there is of course Brother Jeffrey, he will be available to you at
any time. I think you will find him to be an intelligent and reasonably
liberal thinking man and he is well educated in other religions." </p>

<p>The old Abbot looked down at the two young people and was touched by the
love and respect they openly held for each other. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;They are lucky to have each other.&lt;&gt; the old cleric thought,
considering the terrors they faced on a daily basis. &lt;&gt;No one should
have to face that alone.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Realizing how late it was getting he decided to move right on to the
next part of his reason for being there in person. </p>

<p>"It is time for the rest of the purpose of my visit." the Abbot said
with quiet reverence. "There is a small ceremony that is not mentioned
in any of the reference material, the reason being our order removed
it." </p>

<p>"How dare you presume...." Willow started to protest, but the Abbot held
up
his hand </p>

<p>"Please before you condemn us let me explain, please Sorceress." he
asked her and when she nodded her consent, he continued. "Yes I will
admit we removed it for selfish reasons. After everything our
predecessors did, we wanted to reserve this one thing to be our gift, so
to speak. To prove our sincerity and, to be honest, every Abbot since
the conception of our order has reserved this for themselves." </p>

<p>His only hope was that the two young people in front of him would
understand and accept his explanation.</p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 14</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In order to explain the motives for his predecessors interference in the
affairs of an ancient sect long extinct and until recently unknown to
anyone outside the Church, the Abbot felt he must explain the sacred
duties of his office and the dedication of the men that held it through
the centuries. </p>

<p>"At the time we are chosen for this office we spent many hours studying
the rituals until we are able to recite them from memory perfectly. Only
then are we allowed to take our position as Abbot. </p>

<p>Every Abbot has dreamed that he would be the one to perform this ritual
and I am fortunate enough to be chosen by destiny to be the one that
performs the first of your joining rituals, a sort of betrothal
ceremony. </p>

<p>I think you will be surprised at the benefits you will receive as you
complete each stage of your joining." </p>

<p>Willow studied the man's face, concentrating on his dark brown eyes, and
could find no hint of deception. She was still leery of the intentions
of the Church, but her ability to read people had been greatly enhanced
by her powers, and if there was some ulterior motive behind this gesture
the man standing in front of her had no part of it. </p>

<p>"I have one question before I can agree to this unknown ritual." Willow
said, the contempt and sarcasm now gone from her voice. "It is a matter
of honesty and trust between us and it goes no farther than this room.
Do you agree?" </p>

<p>Seeing her sincerity and genuine willingness to cooperate the Abbot
answered her. "As long as it pertains only to me personally I see no
problems with your request, Sorceress. Ask your question." </p>

<p>"I understand that while you're here, you are a simple Abbot in charge
of a highly unorthodox order of brothers, but still only an Abbot. That
isn't exactly a powerful enough office to carry out all the things you
have promised us." Willow said watching the old man's face intently
looking for any sign of deceit. "So my question my dear priest is, when
you aren't running all over the world on the order's business, just what
is your office within the Church. Or as an old friend of mine used to
say, what's your day job?" </p>

<p>The Abbot thought for a moment then realizing the witch probably already
knew the answer, or at least had an idea, he chose to tell them the
truth. </p>

<p>"Good question my dear and fair considering the nature of our
relationship." the Abbot said looking Willow straight in the eye. "When
I am not on business for the order, I am a Cardinal and personal
assistant to the Holy Father.
So as you can see, I am well placed to keep any promises I have made.
Does that answer your question satisfactorily, Sorceress?" </p>

<p>Willow looked up at him for a few seconds then smiled a triumphant grin,
knowing the Abbot had just stepped over the line and had trusted them to
keep his secret. It was enough for her. </p>

<p>"When do we do this ritual and what do we need to perform it?" the now
satisfied witch asked brightly. </p>

<p>The others in the room gave a sigh of relief as it became clear that
Willow believed the Abbot and was going to trust him as much as her own
natural suspicions of the Church would allow. </p>

<p>"What we need is already here." the Abbot began. "This is like a kind of
betrothal ceremony. The two of you announce in front of two official
witnesses your feelings and intentions toward each other, while
exchanging the amulets.
I will officiate and Giles is the second witness. I chose him not for
his position as Watcher but because of his close personal relationship
with the two of you. As for when, I believe there is no time like the
present. It is an informal ritual and it needs to be done before we face
whatever we must face tonight." </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow locked eyes and searched for any doubt, seeing none
they leaned forward and kissed lightly. They turned to the Abbot who was
smiling down at them his eyes alight with hope and compassion for the
two girls.
They nodded their consent to begin. </p>

<p>"So it begins." the Abbot said with quiet reverence. "Willow now that
you have found the mate of your soul, and have agreed to join with her,
place your amulet around your beloved's neck and tell her what is in
your heart." </p>

<p>With trembling hands she carefully put the chain around the Slayer's
slender neck, and with some initial nervous fumbling she eventually
closed the intricate clasp, which faded away leaving a permanent
joining. </p>

<p>"Buffy, my love, what can I say?" Willow began, her trembling voice so
soft only Buffy and the Abbot could hear. "I've loved you since the day
I met you.
You have become my life, my world, my universe.
All that I am, all I do, and all I'll ever be is because of you. Without
you I'm nothing, I would not exist.
I need you, I want you, but more than anything else I love you and with
your consent I will spent my life trying to make you as happy as you
make me by just looking at me.
Please let me be at your side to face with you all that life has to
offer for good or bad.
I'll always be there for you and as long as we have each other, there is
nothing that can defeat us." </p>

<p>Willow stopped, no longer able to speak her throat constricted by the
overwhelming emotion she felt for her lover at this moment. Her eyes
shone with unshed tears and her entire body was trembling. </p>

<p>"Now you Slayer." the Abbot indicated to the petite blonde barely able
to control her own raw emotions the red head had made her feel. "It is
time to declare your true feelings and intentions." </p>

<p>Following her lover's example she leaned forward and tenderly placed the
white rose amulet around Willow's neck. Once the clasp closed, it also
disappeared leaving two fused links in it's place. </p>

<p>"I love you Wills." Buffy whispered reverently almost as if she were
praying. "I don't have a lot of fancy poetic words to describe how much
I feel.
If you were only in my heart or my mind we wouldn't be here, but what I
feel goes way beyond that.
You're in my heart, my mind, my soul, in the very core of my being. If I
was dissected and put under a microscope they would see you.
Without you there is no Slayer, no Buffy, I need you in my life to make
me complete. I want you in my life to be my love and life long
companion.
Please stay with me and never leave because, if you go, you take my
heart and soul with you leaving me nothing but a hollow shell, just
waiting to die." </p>

<p>As Buffy finished speaking the two amulets slowly changed the rhythm of
their pulsating until they became synchronized. </p>

<p>The Abbot stepped forward and gently placed one of his large strong hand
on each girls shoulder. </p>

<p>"Now the two are becoming one." the Abbot intoned repeating the words
he'd memorised years ago in preparation for just this moment. "You walk
the world as one, face adversity as one, and face the forces of Darkness
as one.
As you celebrate your union with your community and before the gods of
Light remember you face them as one.
What one feels the other feels, what one knows the other knows.
For now and forever your love and devotion have made you one that is
stronger than any force the Dark can bring against you.
My hopes, both for you and for humankind, go with you." </p>

<p>The Abbot turned and left the room without further comment. Buffy and
Willow shared a deep passionate kiss, then separated to look into each
other's eyes as if finding visions in their depths they'd never seen
before. </p>

<p>"Wow that..." Buffy began. </p>

<p>"...was different." Willow finished. </p>

<p>"Hey how did you..." </p>

<p>"...do that? I don't know..." </p>

<p>"...I just knew what you..." </p>

<p>"...were going to say." </p>

<p>The two girls looked at each other wide eyed with confusion. Every time
one of them had a thought the other would have the same thought at
almost the same moment. </p>

<p>"This is kinda..." Buffy started. </p>

<p>"...sorta really spooky." Willow again finished the thought. </p>

<p>They stared at each other for a few moments then they both remembered
the Abbot's words..What one knows the other knows. They smiled realizing
they were remembering the same thing and coming to the same conclusion,
time to go, they'd study this new phenomenon later. </p>

<p>They turned to look at Giles who was watching them fascinated by this
newly developed link, how fast the girls were adjusting to it, and
curious as to how deep it went. </p>

<p>"Giles, don't you..." Buffy started. </p>

<p>"...think we should really be going." Willow again finished. </p>

<p>"Well...ah...yes...I ah...suppose so." Giles answered still a little
taken back by the easy way Buffy and Willow simply slipped into this new
situation like it was nothing special, plus he wasn't sure which one to
answer. "We really need to talk though, very soon, so we can study this
new....ah...development." </p>

<p>"Fine, later but for now..." the Slayer spoke first. </p>

<p>"...let's pass out those weapons..." her lover continued without missing
a
beat. </p>

<p>"...and get moving." Buffy finished as she and Willow broke out giggling
at the look on Giles face. </p>

<p>When they'd first become lovers Buffy and Willow could tell what the
other was feeling with a lot of concentration, but now with a casual
effort they could share every conscious thought. </p>

<p>"Wow this is..." Buffy stated. </p>

<p>"..kinda weird but.." Willow continued. </p>

<p>"...it could be..." </p>

<p>"...really handy..." </p>

<p>"...not to mention..." </p>

<p>"...a lot of fun." </p>

<p>Both girls laughed at Giles as he rolled his eyes. </p>

<p>"You two are going to be impossible to live with now." the ex-watcher
sigh in mock frustration. "I'll never know who is speaking for who
or...or...oh Whatever." </p>

<p>Both girls beamed innocently at him, giving their surrogate father their
best 'who me' face causing the normally reserved man to chuckle at their
antics. </p>

<p>"I'm going to help the Brothers arm themselves." Giles said as he rose
from his chair. "And I'll have Brother Jeffrey come in and help you find
any items that may be useful to us tonight." </p>

<p>"Okay Giles and hey could you..." Buffy began. </p>

<p>"...also send in Xander and Cordy, I have a strange feeling..." Willow
joined in. </p>

<p>"...there's some stuff in here for them too." Buffy finished the girls
looking at each other perplexed over where that knowledge had come from. </p>

<p>Giles took one last look at the two girls before he left, pondering how
the shy, confused, uncertain children he'd met all those years ago had
turned into these strong, sure, confident young adults. Even Xander was
showing signs of maturity and strength that had been hidden deep inside
him for so long. </p>

<p>Giles realized he couldn't be prouder of the Scoobies (he laughed
quietly at the name the kids had given themselves years ago) if they
were his own children. </p>

<p>As he turned to finish his preparations he sent out a silent prayer that
they get through this night safely.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>A few hours later Buffy and Willow walked out of the townhouse with
Xander and Cordelia, they walked together until they reached the main
through street. </p>

<p>They split up like they did every night, Xander and Cordelia turning
east toward their new apartment, and the Slayer and her partner headed
for one of the many cemeteries that were a large part of Sunnydale. </p>

<p>This night they headed south to the oldest of the cemeteries as planned. </p>

<p>Xander and Cordelia kept walking until the other two were out of sight,
and as sure as they could be that they weren't being followed, then they
quickly cut across back yards to get to Cordelia's car that she'd hidden
earlier. </p>

<p>They jumped in and headed for the rendezvous Giles had set up earlier
near the old cemetery where Giles had set up the ambush. </p>

<p>Around an hour later Giles and the four clerics left the townhouse and
as two groups made their way separately to meet the other two to set up
their part in the ambush. </p>

<p>As they neared their destination Giles was hoping the "secret weapon"
he'd sent for would come, preferably in time to help and that Buffy
wouldn't be mad at him for using it. </p>

<p>The Countess Hela sat on her makeshift throne, idly tormenting the
nearly dead young woman suspended from the ceiling in front of her. She
hated waiting. </p>

<p>Ten large vampires lounged around the room, awaiting her orders to
proceed with the mission the Countess had assigned them earlier in the
evening. </p>

<p>The large Latino servant Max entered the room and hurried to his beloved
mistress' side. </p>

<p>"Your grace." Max said as he bowed reverently and kissed the exotically
beautiful demoness' offered hand. "There is news of your Slayer and her
witch." </p>

<p>She smiled at her pet psychotic and signalled her pleasure at his
worship. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Soon they will all bow to me as my Max does.&lt;&gt; Hela told herself.
"Tell me my dearest Max." she purred. "What are my little future pets up
to?" </p>

<p>"Your scouts have reported that they are out and alone." her favorite
and only willing human servant reported. "According to reports the two
are heading toward the old cemetery just as you predicted, your grace.
The scout stayed with them long enough to be sure of their destination
then it came straight here." </p>

<p>"Very good, my precious Max." she cooed as she lightly ran her talons
across his massive muscular chest rewarding him with her touch. "It will
soon be time to leave. Once we have them we will be going home to the
jungle house. I grow tired of this place." </p>

<p>"Anything for you, your grace." Max moaned trembling in the ecstasy of
her attentions. "I await your commands." </p>

<p>"Of course." the Countess sighed, smiling benevolently at the enraptured
man. Then she rose from her throne. She reached up and released the
girl's body letting it fall to the cold stone floor. </p>

<p>Max looked down on the broken yet still living anonymous female on the
floor. He smirked as he remembered how arrogant and aloof she was when
she'd first arrived. </p>

<p>She had looked down her nose at him like he was a lowly peasant. He
smiled coldly as he thought about how she'd bragged about being chosen
by the Countess. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;My how the mighty have fallen.&lt;&gt; Max thought with a smirk. &lt;&gt;From top
of
the world to pet food in 24 hours.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>As the psychotic butler followed his beloved mistress toward the
awaiting vampires, the first of the small demon-spawn creatures came out
of the shadows and began sniffing the immobile object. It was soon
joined by it's siblings. </p>

<p>Sensing no threat they began feasting on the helpless quivering,
screaming girl. </p>

<p>Max walked away laughing as the girl's screams soon died down to a
gurgle. His mistress came to her cadre of vampires that was awaiting her
orders. They snapped to attention at her approach. </p>

<p>Their fear of both her, and her human assistant, was almost palpable in
the air as they watched her glowing red eyes inspecting them. </p>

<p>"Alright my children." the Countess Hela purred in her deep rasping
voice. "It is time for you to prove your worthiness to serve me.
Remember, the Slayer and her witch-kit are to be taken with a minimum of
damage.
Also my dear Kresis is fair game. In fact I do not want him to live
through the night. Follow my orders and your rewards will be great, fail
me and your short lives will be exquisitely painful. Now go, I will join
you shortly." </p>

<p>The vampires rushed out determined to follow the Countess' orders to the
letter, even those that hadn't been in her service long had seen enough
to have no doubt that she was quite capable of carrying out her every
threat. </p>

<p>"Stay with me Max. I want you safe and unharmed my pet." Hela purred
while she absent-mindedly stroked the madman's shiny black hair. "We
will pick up the personal guards and go, so we can be there in case
those fools ruin my plans." </p>

<p>"As you wish, your grace." the psychotic Latino answered breathlessly at
his beloved mistress concern. "I am your to command always." </p>

<p>"Of course you are, precious." Hela laughed and signalled two huge
hulking, red skinned demons to follow as she left the room. </p>

<p>The Countess and her entourage left the house and headed to the ambush
point in the old cemetery. As the group walked through the streets Hela
confided her plans to Max. </p>

<p>"On the way back to the jungle house I think I will contact that nice
chaos demon in L.A." she said speculativly. "I will have him gather up a
few playmates for us to take with us. What do you think Max?" </p>

<p>"As you wish your grace." he answered then added enthusiastically. "May
I request one or two red heads this time? They are ever so much fun and
they scream so prettily." </p>

<p>She looked at her favorite pet and was amused by his child like manner
when he made his request. </p>

<p>"Oh alright." Hela said as if indulging a favorite child. "Just
remember, you are not allowed to break them without permission and only
after you have finished your duties. Is that understood?" </p>

<p>"Of course your grace." he answered overwhelmed by her generosity. </p>

<p>Hela chuckled at her pet's excitement as they stepped into the shadows
of the night.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Time moved like a snail on the edge of a razor blade for the impatient
Count Kresis. He knew he'd been played for a fool by his ex-mate Hela.
That she'd almost caused him to violate an edict from the master of
Tarsus, his home world. </p>

<p>No one, demon or not, aristocrat or commoner, would dare violate one of
his edicts. </p>

<p>Fortunately for Kresis he was able to discover the plot his ex had
hatched and now he had compiled evidence that she was completely insane. </p>

<p>It had taken him a while to figure out her entire plan. At first he
thought she was just trying to destroy him. </p>

<p>It was perfect, either the Slayer and her witch would do the job or he
would do away with one or both of them, then he would be hunted down and
destroyed by his own kind for violating one of the dark master's orders. </p>

<p>That plan in and of itself was devious, vicious, and very nearly
perfect. But now after studying the reports of his scouts and
infiltrators along with Hela's recent acts he had finally understood the
real depths and pure audacity of her plans, and the completeness of her
insanity. </p>

<p>Kresis head spun at the unbelievability of what his ancient nemesis was
trying. Not only did Hela mean to destroy him, but she apparently
intended to use him to wear down the Slayer and her witch-kit until she
was able to take them, and after breaking them to her will that bitch
was going to use them as a weapon against the council and quite possibly
the Dark master himself. </p>

<p>Kresis had to laugh at the irony of it all. Hela was always talking
about how he was so stupidly chauvinistic that he inevitably
underestimated his female adversaries. </p>

<p>Well he'd learned his lessons many earth centuries ago when the Countess
had betrayed him into exile. </p>

<p>Now here she was thinking that she alone could defeat the latest
incarnation of the great Sorceress or, even more ridiculous, that she
could separate the Sorceress from her Slayer now that they'd
acknowledged each other. </p>

<p>He couldn't believe that after all this time Hela was falling for her
own reputation and thought that she, or any other of their race had the
strength to do that. </p>

<p>It was obvious to him that she hadn't felt the steadily increasing power
of the young witch-kit, but he had. </p>

<p>The first time they had clashed she had barely fought off his assault.
However this last time he had attacked her on several different planes
at once and although she had collapsed with exhaustion, Kresis had
barely survived the backlash caused by her power. </p>

<p>It struck him that Hela had no idea that every time the Sorceress was
pushed to her limits by a metaphysical attack, her powers increased
three-fold. He hadn't known himself until he'd done some in depth
research , and the math. </p>

<p>This meant that Kresis had more working knowledge on the situation than
Hela. </p>

<p>"For the first time I've gotten a step ahead of my precious ex." Kresis
told himself out loud, attracting the attention of his three remaining
retainers. Noticing this he turned to them. "Well I hope you are better
at fighting your own kind than you have been against the Slayer and her
friends, because if we fail tonight none of us will see tomorrow's
sunset." </p>

<p>The Count spun with a flourish and left the room followed by his
retainers, all realizing they were headed for the battle of their
unlives. </p>

<p>This time they faced a far worse enemy then ever, not the Slayer and the
Sorceress, but a Countess of the first circle and her small army of
their own kind. It was a toss as to which would kill them first. </p>

</table>

<p>The cemetery was lit only by the soft eerie light of the crescent moon.
The tombstones, mausoleums, and surrounding trees cast strange shadows
that were able to hide a multitude of evils.
The tall dark figure watched the two young women as they made their way
across the grounds. A patchy ground fog hid their feet to the ankles. A
smile crossed his lips as he watched the two make their way cautiously
from shadow to shadow.</p>

<p>The figure had watched with interest as the pair encountered young but
determent vampires, three encounters, three dusted vampires. It was
clear to him that the petite blonde and her red haired companion hadn't
lost anything since he'd last seen them. They had taken out their
opponents with impressive speed and efficiency of motion. </p>

<p>He was beginning to wonder what had prompted Giles' frantic call for
help. The ex-watcher was not known to panic unnecessarily and the tall
figure knew the deceptively mild mannered man would not risk the
inevitable temper fest if the Slayer found out he was here, unless
absolutely necessary.                   </p>

<p>After all Buffy had made it quite clear his presence was no longer
needed when she'd told him of her new relationship with Willow. Granted
he had not reacted well but considering she'd just sprung it on him with
no warning what so ever. What had she expected?
    </p>

<p>The real trouble was that by the time he'd had enough time to sort out
how he really felt about her newly discovered lifestyle, they'd already
had a devastating fight, complete with the usual vicious comments
recriminations and nasty name calling. He was sure that the young
sensitive girl wasn't about to forgive him. </p>

<p>Of course, in her defence, she'd never would have been so enraged at him
if he'd confined his venomous verbal remarks to her. But when he'd
verbally attacked Willow he realized, too late, that he'd crossed the
line. </p>

<p>Buffy had gone ballistic, and in a flurry of punches and kicks she'd
driven him from Giles' home demanding that he never come near her or her
friends again. He was told to keep his bigoted small minded opinions
away from them.             </p>

<p>The next evening he'd packed what he wanted of his belongings and left
Sunnydale and not returned until tonight.</p>

<p>Oh sure he'd tried to apologize for his stupidity, but his one time love
had coldly rebuked each attempt without hearing them. At home he had a
small mountain of returned unopened letters, packages, flowers and candy
as evidence of his heart felt regret for hurting Buffy and her beloved
witch Willow. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;If I'd only kept it between us and left the love of her life out of
it.&lt;&gt; the brooding vampire speculated. &lt;&gt;All that would probably be
behind us by now and I wouldn't have to hide to help her.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>He sighed deeply when he thought of how much he missed the easy
camaraderie they'd shared for years. How the sound of her laugh had been
able to lift his soul from the deepest abyss. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Well I guess that's all over now.&lt;&gt; he thought, as the almost constant
depression slipped back over him. &lt;&gt;There's no way old Angel would be
welcome back in Sunnydale as far as Buffy Summers is concerned. Gods I
miss her, even just as a friend.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Angel's thoughts were interrupted when sudden movements appeared in the
shadows that the two girls were coming close to. </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow walked through the cemetery as if this was any other
night, but no matter how casual they appeared on the surface, underneath
they were both tensed and on guard with every sense alert, scanning the
depths of each shadow for signs of the expected ambush. </p>

<p>As they went along on their regular patrol, they tested and learned the
limits of their newly acquired mental link. </p>

<p>So far they'd figured out that they shared thoughts and emotions but it
wasn't like they were talking to each other. It was more like they
instantly knew what the other was thinking and feeling. They'd also
figured out how to block each other out so they each could have a
certain amount of privacy. </p>

<p>When Willow sensed a presence watching them earlier, she let Buffy have
access to her thoughts so she was warned. </p>

<p>To her frustration the witch was unable penetrate the barriers the
entity had erected around itself and wasn't able to identify it as
friend or foe. </p>

<p>"Damn!" Willow muttered under her breath. "I still can't figure out who
that is out there." </p>

<p>"No prob Wills." Buffy said softly to reassure her friend. "If they
weren't friendly..." </p>

<p>"...they would have attacked by now." Willow finished with a smirk. "I
realize that but not knowing makes me..." </p>

<p>"...nervous." Buffy finished, smiling back at her companion. "Relax
Wills, I've got a feeling I know..." </p>

<p>"Angel?" Willow asked surprised at her lover's thoughts. </p>

<p>"Yeah, I think he's trying to make amends for what he said." the Slayer
whispered. "I know he's sorry, but after 246 years you'd think he'd know
better." </p>

<p>Willow blurted out a laugh at Buffy's comment. </p>

<p>"How long ya' gonna make him suffer?" Willow asked trying to hide her
nervousness. </p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know." Buffy said smiling secretly to her lover. "He looks
so good when he mopes, I'd hate to be the one to spoil his fun." </p>

<p>Their levity was interrupted when Buffy's "Slayer sense" went off,
alerting her to the nearness of her favorite kind of opponents. Willow
could feel her mate's sudden tension and immediately knew it's cause.
          </p>

<p>Buffy stepped back, placing herself between her beloved Willow and the
shadows and assumed her combat stance. </p>

<p>Three large extremely mean looking vampires glided from the shadows. </p>

<p>"Hello Slayer." one of the creatures purred menacingly. "I can't tell
you how truly delighted we are to see you." </p>

<p>"Is that so?" Buffy said, trying to buy time for her allies to get into
position. She could hear Willow chanting under her breath. "Do you
really have that much of a death wish, vamp?" </p>

<p>She used that particular nickname for the undead because she knew how
much they hated it. </p>

<p>"Ah that remains to be seen, my tiny Slayer." the spokesman said scoring
a hit of his own. </p>

<p>She looked at the still handsome face of the lead vampire, and wondered
if she'd ever met him before he was turned, he looked familiar. She was
going to ask but decided it didn't matter now and shrugged it off. </p>

<p>"No love, you've never met him before." Willow giggled into the Slayer's
ear. "He's from out of town. I think it's time." </p>

<p>Buffy turned slightly and nodded her head to let her partner know she
understood. </p>

<p>"So are we here to fight or are you trying to bore me to death?" Buffy
asked sarcastically, contempt dripping from her voice. "Don't any of you
know anything new?" </p>

<p>The lead vampire snarled at the small blonde's insult and losing control
he launched himself at the Slayer. She met his attack with a flurry of
spinning kicks and back fists that not only stopped the undead
assailant, but began to drive him back toward a big ornate tombstone.
One of his allies snuck around behind Buffy in an attempt to blind side
her. </p>

<p>"Buffy! behind you!" Willow shouted to warn her mate. </p>

<p>Thanks to Willow's warning Buffy caught the vamp's movement and ducking
under his punch, she launched a side snap kick into his chest, jumping
up as her second attacker flew backwards to slam into a tombstone. </p>

<p>As he straightened back up Buffy threw her arm forward releasing a long
sharply pointed wooden stake that blurred through the air to penetrate
the vamp's chest piercing his heart.           </p>

<p>Pain and surprise registered on his face just in time for him to explode
in a cloud of dust. </p>

<p>The Slayer turned her attention back to her original opponent.
unobserved by Buffy the third vampire launched a more cautious attack on
the Slayer's red haired companion. </p>

<p>Surprised by the attack Willow fell back using her staff to fend off the
vampire's assault.                 </p>

<p>When Buffy's opponent suddenly turned and ran, she took off after him
unaware that her Willow wasn't right behind her. </p>

<p>"Come on Wills." Buffy shouted enthusiastically over her shoulder. "I
think this is it!" </p>

<p>Buffy ran at full speed disappearing over a slight rise that placed her
out of sight, unaware that her single minded concentration had cut her
off from her lover's thoughts. </p>

<p>Willow was too busy holding back the third vampire that was slowly
forcing her back toward an old vine covered mausoleum. </p>

<p>The harder he pressed the harder she tried to concentrate. Finally her
extra training and natural defences took over and the mystical eerie
neon green glow of her metaphysical powers began to rise.
The brighter the glow the stronger her counterattack became. The tide of
battle slowly turned in Willow's favor and as she began pushing the
vampire back she forgot to guard her own back.
      </p>

<p>A vampire that neither Buffy nor Willow had detected earlier slipped out
of the shadow of the mausoleum and stealthily approached the witch from
behind. </p>

<p>Knowing that his mistress wanted this slender girl alive with a minimum
of damage the vamp was preparing to strike her from behind. </p>

<p>Anticipating his rewards the vampire failed to check for any other
possible opponents, an error he didn't live long enough to repeat. </p>

<p>"Willow, down!" a familiar voice shouted from behind the vampire she was
facing. </p>

<p>Without thinking Willow dropped to her knees, a blur flew over her head
and a stake appeared in the chest of the vampire that was sneaking up
behind her, and as he disappeared in a swirling cloud of dust a dark
figure appeared behind the vampire facing her. </p>

<p>An arm wrapped around his throat and the vampire was bent backwards over
a tombstone and an arm came down hard driving a sharp wooden stake into
his heart. </p>

<p>As that one joined his comrade in a dust cloud Willow rose to her feet
and looked into the dark eyes of her rescuer. </p>

<p>"Thank you Angel." Willow said gratefully and smiling at him shyly. "We
were wondering when you were going to join us, we missed you." </p>

<p>"It was no big deal, Willow." Angel said embarrassed by the girl's
gratitude. "I'm just glad I was here for you." </p>

<p>"Me too." the witch answered awkwardly, remembering why he'd been gone
so long. "Does this mean you forgive Buffy and I for being in love?" </p>

<p>He nodded his head looking down in shame over his rude comments, that
he'd made about both girls. He started to say something but stopped when
he saw the shy smile disappear from her lips.             </p>

<p>Angel could tell something was wrong. </p>

<p>Willow was suddenly overcome with feelings of fear, revulsion, and rage
that swept over her. The sudden change in the girl's expression
concerned Angel. </p>

<p>"Willow?" he inquired worried "What is it? What's wrong?" </p>

<p>The witch's green glowing eyes locked on the souled vampire's dark gaze,
a look of pure horror came over her face and she whispered the one word
that conveyed her feelings of hopeless soul shattering terror.
"BUFFY!" </p>
