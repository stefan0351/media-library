<!-- Ante Up (aka Two In One Turbolift Tale) \ null -->

<p>"It was fortunate that you had these in your possession when the turbolift ceased to be functional."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, you're damn lucky to be stuck here with me."</p>

		<p>The lieutenant laughed at the irony of her words as she and Seven sat cross-legged on the floor of the turbolift. Lt. Torres, Chief Engineer aboard Voyager, was stuck in the lift with someone she had only recently begun to like. Initially, both women had refused to be trapped, citing the numerous errands they had to complete before their shift ended in the remaining minutes. They had spent the first hour of their confinement trying to figure a way to repair, or at least escape the turbolift. But after the hour, and numerous rounds of swearing by the half-Klingon of which the young Borg tolerated with a mere quirk of her brow, both women had to submit to the stubbornness at which the glorified elevator displayed.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna shuffled the stack of cards after winning the last round of poker. She had been about ready to join her recently divorced husband, Tom Paris, and Harry for a fun night of card games, but only after she inspected the progress of Vorik's Engineering team. Vorik was in charge of repairing the EPS network relay on Deck 11 that afternoon, but the repairs were fouled up when an unexpected vessel decloaked and fired upon Voyager. An instrument in the hands of a young Ensign had been accidentally driven into the highly sensitive relay, causing a number of circuit failures coincidentally at the same time both B'Elanna and Seven had entered the turbolift.</p>

		<p>It took a few minutes for B'Elanna to realize that she had brought along just the thing to keep them preoccupied until the Vulcan engineer was able to get them out. But when she did, she found out Seven had never played card games before. The ex-drone reluctantly agreed to humor her and accepted her beginner's lessons in playing poker. At first, Seven had lost most of the games, but seeing as how the Klingon remained patient, she relaxed and adapted to the situation. It had become much more of a challenge since then.</p>

		<p>"Vorik to Lt. Torres."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna perked up. "Torres here, go ahead."</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant, the EPS network is still being repaired. However, I have a team working on manually advancing the turbolift to the nearest deck so that we may pry the doors open."</p>

		<p>"All right, remember to bring the 'door wedge' with you," she reminded him.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>"Ask Carey, B'Elanna out."</p>

		<p><shuffle, shuffle, pass, play, shuffle, cut, pass, play, shuffle, shuffle...></p>

		<p>A sigh from the lieutenant broke Seven's concentration. "Is there something wrong, Lt. Torres?"</p>

		<p>"Hmm?... Oh, no...," B'Elanna denied absently. "Well, actually this IS getting just a little repetitive."</p>

		<p>"Do you wish to discontinue this activity?" Seven asked, rearranging her cards into the appropriate sequences.</p>

		<p>"No, there's nothing else to do." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna sighed again. This time Seven put down the cards and looked directly at the half-Klingon. Feeling too restless for a silent staring contest, B'Elanna drop her cards too.</p>

		<p>"Okay! I was just thinking that it would be so much more interesting if we had something to bet on. But we're stuck here without anything else between us other than empty space."</p>

		<p>"Bet? As in wagering items between two parties on the outcome of a contest? I fail to see how that would make the game more interesting. Why would you risk items you may regret losing in the future?"</p>

		<p>"Because, Seven, without risk there's no gain. The threat of losing something drives the heart rate a little faster, makes you think harder, keeps you on your toes," B'Elanna explained. "And then the feeling you get when you win, especially someone else's belongings, it's exhilarating."</p>

		<p>"I wish to experience this exhilaration."</p>

		<p>"Hey, who says you'd win," B'Elanna joked.</p>

		<p>If it had been a few months before, Seven probably wouldn't have responded to her joke. However, now was a different story, and Seven quirked her lips in amusement.</p>

		<p>The lieutenant wondered aloud, "What can we use to gamble with?"</p>

		<p>"Replicator rations?" Seven suggested.</p>

		<p>"Hmm...I used up too much of my rations when I was with Tom."</p>

		<p>"Holodeck times?"</p>

		<p>"Do you even have to ask?"</p>

		<p>"What other items do you propose then?" Seven questioned with exasperation.</p>

		<p>Hearing a snicker, Seven looked up from her shuffling to spot a fleeting smirk on B'Elanna's face. Knowing the Chief Engineer had thought of something, she became curious. "Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>Seeing the Klingon blush and look away, Seven was extremely determined to find out what she had been thinking.</p>

		<p>"You obviously have a suggestion."</p>

		<p>"No, I don't. I was just...never mind."</p>

		<p>"Please do not hesitate to reveal it. I can assure you I would be willing to consider it."</p>

		<p>"It's not that...," B'Elanna said a bit flustered. But seeing as how Seven would not let the matter drop, she answered, "I was just thinking about the time Tom, Harry and I decided to play poker and it turned into a strip poker contest. Harry was blushing the whole time, maybe because he was losing the most and down to his boxers, though I wasn't doing so hot either. To our surprise, the Captain decided to join us that evening after turning us down repeatedly on our other poker nights." She laughed. "Poor Harry, he tripped over himself so many times trying to scramble back into his clothes while Tom went to open the door without waiting for us to finish dressing."</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the Borg could not find it funny as she did not know what strip poker was. Embarrassed, B'Elanna explained. </p>

		<p>"I do not understand why the removal of clothing would achieve the exhilaration you so describe before."</p>

		<p>"You had to be there. It's similar really, making people do something they won't necessarily do usually," B'Elanna laughed once more.</p>

		<p>"Then we shall play strip poker-"</p>

		<p>"-What?" The laughter had stopped abruptly.</p>

		<p>"Since we have no other resources on which to wager, we can play strip poker," Seven explained as if it was a logical conclusion.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna felt her heart race suddenly. Playing with a group of friends for some naughty fun was one thing, but playing with a six foot blonde with a body like that in a tightly confined space was another. Not that the lieutenant was attracted to women or anything, or Seven for that matter.... *Who the hell was she kidding?*   </p>

		<p>"Uh, Seven, you don't...we can't...,uh, play in the turbolift."</p>

		<p>"Why not? There is no one else present. We need to preoccupy our time in some manner. And we ha-"</p>

		<p>"Yes, yes, all very good reasons. But what do you have under that suit? Is it all one thing?" B'Elanna asked gesturing with a wave of her hand.</p>

		<p>"My shoes can be removed separately. However, my only attire is the biosuit which is one single unit."</p>

		<p>"Uh-huh...," B'Elanna croaked, her throat suddenly parched.</p>

		<p>"Jacks are wild," Seven said as she passed out the cards before B'Elanna could object any further.</p>

		<p>"Seven, you don't have much to bet with ," the half-Klingon tried to argue valiantly for the Borg one last time.</p>

		<p>"You are assuming I'll lose," Seven replied with a slight smirk not even B'Elanna couldn't mistake.</p>

		<p>"Alright, you asked for it, Borg. I'm going to beat the pants off of you, literally."</p>

		<p>"Touché, Lieutenant. I am sure you will make an honorable attempt."</p>

		<p>An hour later...</p>

		<p>"Three of a kind," B'Elanna gloated with a gleam in her eye knowing that the biosuit would be the next article of clothing Seven would lose. That was for making her play this game. And for making her strip down to her tank top and underwear.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, but I believe a straight defeats a three of a kind," Seven remarked calmly, betraying none of her excitement.</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon had been right. When she started playing the newly structured card game with the lieutenant, she was not really expecting any physiological or emotional changes as B'Elanna had spoken about. But with each game she lost, she felt the sting of defeat and the need for retribution keenly. Though she had no need for modesty, the fact that she had to remove her clothing whenever she lost to the other woman stirred her strangely human instinct for competition. And as she won, Seven suddenly understood the exhilaration B'Elanna had explained. That exhilaration touched upon something much deeper however, when she watched as the half-Klingon stripped her clothing off. At first, it was fairly mundane with shoes, socks, jacket. But then when B'Elanna had stood up and taken her pants off, the temperature in the lift suddenly became hotter and the air became thinner. If the slightly older woman had not been paying attention to removing her pants, she would have seen Seven swallow hard and gawk at her tone, athletic thighs. The young blonde never expected the lean muscle and smooth, bronze skin to be so...rather pleasing. Extremely pleasing to her eye. She had scrutinized the body with a naked interest, heightened by the fact that there was still much more hidden, only hinted at when the top rode up the trim waist or when the lieutenant hunched over.</p>

		<p>"Son of a baktag!" B'Elanna swore, throwing her cards down, and began pulling the tank top off of her well-developed torso. Self-consciously, the Klingon folded her arms over her chest after adjusting her bra, the act only serving to squeeze her plump breasts together. "Um, Seven,...your deal?..."</p>

		<p>"Yes, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>If she didn't know better, Seven was looking a little flushed. Then again, so was she. It was starting to get a bit more confining, though B'Elanna never thought she was claustrophobic before. In fact, it felt like Seven was only an arm's length away from her. And every sound they made was augmented by the acoustic capacity of the turbolift; the shuffling of cards, her nervous sniffing which had become an uncontrollable urge, the snapping of her bra against her skin, the chafing of Seven's suit as she shifted her legs, their deep breathing.</p>

		<p>Everything was getting on her nerves until she looked at her cards. And what a hand it was! The key was keeping her face straight long enough until they showed their hand, so that she could witness the expression on Seven's face when she lost. She rubbed her hands mentally with glee.</p>

		<p>"Full house of queens, read 'em and weep," B'Elanna boasted, propping her chin on her hands.</p>

		<p>"I believe I have lost," the Borg remarked dejectedly and somewhat surprised. "I only have two pairs of sevens."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna's face fell. "What? That.... You.... Fuck! That means you win!"</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>"That's a four of a kind. Don't you remember me talking about that?!"</p>

		<p>"Ah, yes, it does appear to be a four of a kind. This means you are required to remove another item of clothing," Seven said, almost too brightly.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna peered at her indignantly. A loss was a loss and that meant she had to strip off her bra, but her hands refused to cooperate. Seven only gave her an expectant look, cocking that insufferable ocular implant of hers. Then, B'Elanna spotted her way out.</p>

		<p>"Ah-ha, you forgot one card in the shuffle. See, it was hidden under your foot," B'Elanna declared, whipping the errant card out in front of the ex-drone. "The last match has to be replayed."</p>

		<p>"I assure you that I would not have misplaced a single card. It must have just occurred," Seven argued stubbornly, not willing to replay. She had won the game fairly and now she wanted to see those breasts bared. </p>

		<p>The young Borg frowned at her own thought. Why did winning a simple card game become so important to her? Surely, she had no ego to be bruised. After all, it was conceivable that she had missed gathering the four of spades into the deck, thereby altering the probability of her obtaining the hand that she had won with. Therefore the game should be replayed again. Perhaps her motivation was far more insidious. Did she want B'Elanna naked? For what purpose? She should have no interest in seeing another female body nude since she herself had one, which was apparently attractive. Or so Lt. Paris implied during the last social event after a few alcoholic drinks.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna watched as a multitude of subtle expressions flitted across the beautiful Borg's face. Beautiful?... Must be the thin air in here, she concluded. Still she couldn't ignore the arrogant frown that remained on Seven's face.</p>

		<p>"We play again!" B'Elanna growled.</p>

		<p>"I won. Remove your brassiere!" Seven ordered. The stiff pebbles that were peeking through the thin material had tormented her long enough.</p>

		<p>"No, you're cheating," the lieutenant refused, poking a finger at Seven's unavoidably abundant chest.</p>

		<p>"I do not cheat. Comply!"</p>

		<p>"I will not! I never thought Seven of Nine would stoop to cheating," B'Elanna retorted, breath coming in pants as her temper began to flare and the blood in her veins began to boil. </p>

		<p>"And I never knew Klingons to be so modest! Or so juvenile in their sportsmanship, for that matter!"</p>

		<p>"Oh Kahless!..."</p>

		<p>Seven leaned back defensively against the wall when the agitated Klingon rose up, unable to dodge the bra snapped towards her face, followed unnecessarily by Star Fleet issued panties. </p>

		<p>"Here!" B'Elanna's full breasts jiggled as the Klingon had jumped out of her underwear, holding her arms out in exasperation. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, at the same instant, Vorik managed to pry open the doors, enough to get a view of the naked lieutenant. B'Elanna could see the surprise even on the face of the normally impassive Vulcan. </p>

		<p>"Hahhhhhh, Lieuten-?!" Vorik blurted, before he let go and the doors slammed shut again.</p>

		<p>"Oh god..."  B'Elanna slap a hand to her forehead, closing her eyes. "Now, I'll never hear the end of it during his next Pon Farr."</p>

		<p>"Vorik to Lt. Torres <ahem>."</p>

		<p>She sighed. "Go ahead, Vorik."</p>

		<p>"We failed to apply the 'door wedge.' It will take us another half hour to retract the locking mechanism-"</p>

		<p>"Yes, Vorik, just get it done."</p>

		<p>"Yes, Ma'am...my apologies. Vorik out."</p>

		<p>Seven had bitten her lip throughout the whole exchange. She wasn't sure if the urge welling up in her chest would erupt as laughter from Vorik's interruption, or something else at the sight of the naked half-Klingon. All she knew was that she was currently fascinated with the flush now creeping over the nicely tanned body.</p>

		<p>Feeling a bit foolish, B'Elanna slumped and slid down the wall of the turbolift, coming to rest on her bare bottom, prickled by the rough carpet. She held her hand out to the Borg, who promptly passed over the undergarments without word.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Lieutenant," was all Seven could think of.</p>

		<p>"That...was humiliating," B'Elanna drawled.</p>

		<p>"Why?"</p>

		<p>"Because I just flashed Vorik, and you!" she groused, leaning forward to put her bra on.</p>

		<p>"Why is that a concern? Your body is aesthetically pleasing."</p>

		<p>"Really?"</p>

		<p>"You did not know?" Seven asked, a bit surprised that the Klingon was so unaware. "Is that why you were reluctant to accept the loss of your wager?"</p>

		<p>"Well,...I haven't felt very attractive lately. Not after Tom and I broke up."</p>

		<p>"Why would you need to feel attractive for me?"</p>

		<p>"Ah,..." Stumped, B'Elanna tried to dig herself out of the hole she created. "Maybe attractive isn't the right word." Looking away nervously, she began picking at the link in the carpet. "I mean, compared to your body mine just seems so..."</p>

		<p>Moving in, Seven cupped her face with a gentle hand, and lifted her head up to gaze into her coffee brown eyes. "Do wish me to find you attractive, Lieutenant?" she asked intently, watching her answer unveil before her as the Klingon's pupils dilated and cheeks blushed crimson.</p>

		<p>"I..."</p>

		<p>"Because I do."</p>

		<p>Pulling B'Elanna close, the young Borg kissed her softly on the lips. Soon the kiss deepened and B'Elanna felt, among other things, an insistent tug on her bra as she was pressed against the wall by the tall blonde straddling her.</p>

		<p>"Seems...a little unfair...that you're still dressed," B'Elanna gasped as Seven's tongue teased her left nipple.</p>

		<p>Smooching the luscious lips once more, Seven invited, "High card draw?"</p>

		<p>"...Heh, two of spades."</p>

		<p>"Ace of cubs. I must admit defeat."</p>

		<p>Officially, it took one more hour and two more attempts by Vorik in order to free the women from the turbolift. At least, that was what the report said when Janeway read it the next morning. Unofficially, well... </p>
