<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 10 -->

<p>Annika had no idea how she got home that night...she managed to walk upright and with purpose until she was out of sight of Beyla and Harry, only then did she allow her knees to buckle, grasping a torch pole to remain on her feet.  Anger quickly turned to sorrow as tears streamed down her face.  She pulled the leather thong from around her neck and made as if to cast Beyla's ring into the night, but instead she closed her fist around it, holding on so tightly the gemstones drew blood from her palm.  She finally understood the term broken heart; it felt as if her heart was shattered into a thousand pieces.  Silent sobs wracked her body and she stumbled blindly into the night.  Somehow she managed to find her way back to her parent's lodging and she collapsed onto her bed, crying silently until her mind shut itself down and at last she slept.</p>
<p>Harry helped B'Elanna to her feet, her face was a study of pain and tears fell unnoticed down her cheeks.  He took her inside their tent and sat her down on her bed.  He gently removed the clothing and binding cloths from her unprotesting body.  She seemed to be in a fugue state; as if her mind was incapable of taking in any more information and so had shut itself down.  The only evidence of comprehension were the tears that continued to fall.  Harry lay her gently back onto the bed and, not knowing what else to do to comfort her, simply lay fully clothed beside her and wrapped his arms around her.</p>
<p>In the morning B'Elanna woke up and dressed with Harry's help; it broke his heart to see the dull emptiness of eyes once so fiery and bright.  He did his best to be supportive and understanding at the same time as he urged her to get dressed and help him strike their camp.  He was uncertain as to whether or not B'Elanna would have the strength of will necessary to enter the next tournament, and so he suggested that they skip the next few tournaments until she as feeling more up to battle.  In truth he was worried that the Hansart family was going to be following the tournament circuit all season and that sooner or later B'Elanna or Annika would crack under the strain of such constant painful reminders and that B'Elanna's secret would be revealed.  But when he made the suggestion B'Elanna shook her head furiously and insisted that she was going to continue with her campaign to become tournament champion; no attempt on his part to dissuade her was successful.  So it was that in a few hours they were packed and on the road to the next town.</p>
<p>Annika opened her eyes to the light that was streaming in through the window of her room. For one brief moment she forgot the events of the previous evening and she experienced a moment of happiness, until she glanced at the ring still clutched in her hand and her memories came crashing down around her.  Her eyes filled yet once more with tears but still she could not bring herself to cast away the ring and almost reluctantly she placed it back around her neck.  Its familiar weight between her breasts was of no comfort, but she could not bear to part with it as yet.</p>
<p>She felt a flash of anger at Lord Beyla for toying with her emotions so callously.  Certainly he had never loved her...but he was not a man, even now Annika could hardly believe it.  She had been completely taken in.  It was not possible for a woman to love another woman in that way...and yet she had fallen in love with Beyla...but she hadn't known he was a woman when she fell in love.  Her mind was in a turmoil of emotion and confusion.  She loved Beyla, and yet she couldn't possibly, he didn't even exist.  How could she have imagined his feelings for her were genuine...and yet she had heard the anguish in his, no her, voice when she was pleading for her to stay, surely that could not have been an act...whoever the woman pretending to be Beyla was she genuinely felt love for Annika...but it was wrong, against God, and Annika would have no part of it.  Her resolve was firm now...she would become the dutiful daughter her parents deserved and marry the man they found for her.  Whether or not she loved Beyla and was loved in return by her was of no consequence and didn't bear further thought.  If her father decided that Charles Kotay was the proper husband for her then she would smile and marry him, despite how her heart was breaking at the thought.  That decided she began to clean herself up to face the day.</p>
<p>Harry and B'Elanna rode without talking for most of the day.  B'Elanna was slumped in the saddle and showed no interest in her surroundings or where they were going.  It was up to Harry to lead the way, and he knew if he didn't stop and eat that B'Elanna would simply ride mindlessly onward until she fell off her horse in sleep.  He took care of her, ensuring that she drank water and ate the food he prepared for her, and he worried that her heart would never recover from losing Annika.  He knew that she loved the young woman deeply and that she had always been convinced that they would find a way to begin together despite the reality of their situation.  Harry's heart ached for his friend as he watched her ride along lost in the mists of her thoughts.</p>
<p>Annika's father had arranged for the family to take their evening meal with Charles Kotay and Annika was dreading another dinner of boring talk about land and the benefits of the feudal system in England.  Lord Kotay was older than she was, although not nearly as old as some of the men her father had met with regarding her marriage.  He was handsome in a rugged way, his looks only marred by a fan shaped scar over his left eye, received when he was splashed with burning oil at the siege of Harfleur while he was fighting with King Henry in France.  He had been rewarded for his service to the King with large land holdings in the north of England and it was this land, and his connection to the king that made him such an attractive prospect to her father.  His land notwithstanding, he was cash poor and it was this fact that made her father's proposal that they marry so attractive to Kotay.</p>
<p>Dinner was as tedious as Annika had expected it might be, her father and Kotay talked at length about land, money and other issues that held little interest for Annika.  Although Lord Hansart was feeling that Lord Kotay might be a good choice for his daughter he felt it was a little early in the game to limit his choices and so he refrained from making any promises to the gentleman, content for now to feel him out on the subject of money, land and marriage. Kotay took little notice of Annika other than to make a polite greeting when he arrived at the inn.  Annika wondered if it were possible that she would ever be able to talk to Kotay the way she had with Beyla. Judging by his lack of interest in her she rather doubted it.  She shook her head and forced herself to not think about Beyla.  That was a chapter of her life that was closed and it would do her no good to dwell on it.  As far as she was concerned Beyla, whoever she was, was dead to her.</p>
<p>The evening ended at last and Kotay placed a perfunctory kiss on her hand as he took his leave.  He was going to the next tournament as well and although her father made no firm plans to spend time with him he definitely implied it might be to their mutual benefit to continue their discussions further.  Kotay agreed and then he was gone.  Annika's father seemed happy with the way things were going and so he was in an uncommonly jovial mood.  He didn't seem to notice that Annika was pale and drawn, or that she had hardly touched her meal.  He kissed her on the forehead as he made his way up to his room and told her they would be leaving early in the morning.  Annika returned to her room only to be confronted by Kate who wished to know what the matter was with her tonight.  Annika could not bear to tell her handmaiden the truth about her humiliation at the hands of Lord Beyla so she made up a small lie about not feeling well and retired for the night.  Once again thoughts of Beyla, his face and his laugh, the way he listened so intently to every word she spoke returned to taunt her.  Firmly she reminded herself that it had all been a lie, that he was a she; Annika turned her face to the pillow as bitter tears flowed once more.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was faring little better.  She had not cried since the first night, but the spark that had made her so compelling, such a force of nature, was gone.  She plodded through the day and night without speaking, her world was completely bleak now.  She had found the perfect love and it was to be denied her because she was a woman.  Such considerations seemed trivial to her when she thought about how powerful her attraction to Annika was.  Surely the girl wasn't immune; she must still feel this love and be suffering as well.  B'Elanna knew that they would see one another soon and her soul cried out at the thought of seeing her love but being unable to talk to her or touch her.  She briefly contemplated following Harry's advice and leaving for France, but she squared her shoulders and resolved to carry on with her quest.  If she could not have Annika she would become the greatest fighter England had ever seen.  Perhaps the pain of her broken heart would be eased through her physical exertions.  She could only hope so.</p>
<p>When she dressed for her first fight of the tournament B'Elanna hesitated, holding the scarf Annika had given her in her hand.  She knew she couldn't wear it openly, but found herself unable to put it aside, finally she settled for tucking it inside of her shirt, next to her heart, before she put on her armour.  She wasn't sure if its presence made her feel better or worse, but it somehow seemed essential so she accepted it.</p>
<p>Harry was worried about her ability to keep her mind on the fight; worried she might be hurt.  A small part of him however thought perhaps if she were retired early some time away from the tournament and the sight of Lady Hansart might do her some good.  He was surprised then by the fury B'Elanna displayed in the sword ring during her first match.  It was the shortest fight he could remember seeing so far.  B'Elanna showed none of her usual grace and finesse with the blade, rather she wielded it like a hammer and beat her opponent into submission.  It was the same with every contest.  Her style was gone, replaced with an implacable fury that seemed frightening and unstoppable.</p>
<p>As she stood just inside the arena waiting for her first jousting match she couldn't stop herself from glancing up into the stands to see if Annika was there.  She spotted her right away, sitting with her entire family.  Her father appeared deep in conversation with a knight that B'Elanna had noticed at several other tournaments, Kotay she believed his name was.  She felt a chill steal over her heart as she pondered what his presence might possibly mean.  So distracted was she by her thoughts that she charged into the first tilt without remembering to put the visor of her helmet down.  It was only a second before contact that she realized her error and used her left hand to snap the visor into place.  She still managed to break her lance on the other knight's chest, although she was so unbalanced that she was nearly borne to the ground by the force of his strike.  She returned to Harry and received her next lance without raising the visor or speaking, and this time she charged faster than she ever had before; thrusting the lance into her opponent's body with all of her strength she unhorsed him with the power of her blow ending the match.</p>
<p>The rest of the tournament was the same as the first day and B'Elanna won every event she entered.  She was tournament champion for the very first time and yet she found it meant little to her.  In fact she felt completely dead inside and barely acknowledged the congratulations of her fellow knights as she left the arena with her trophies.  She returned to her tent to find Harry making preparations to leave that night for the next tournament.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"  She asked seeing Harry dismantling the tent.</p>
<p>"I thought perhaps you would wish to get a head start on the road to Hastings."</p>
<p>"Well you thought wrong.  I'll be attending the banquet as usual."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna do you really think that is wise.  You will only end up being hurt.  I heard from Tom that Charles Kotay has entered into talks with Lord Hansart for Annika's hand.  They will be attending the banquet together tonight...you really don't want to see that do you.  Let us skip the banquet and go to the tavern with some of the others if you don't wish to depart this evening...we'll drink too much and forget this mess with the Hansart's."</p>
<p>"I know what you're trying to do Harry and I appreciate it, but I'm going to the banquet so you might as well save your breath."</p>
<p>Harry knew when he was beaten so he stopped his work and went to help B'Elanna prepare for the evening. Shaking his head as he watched her walk away into the night he sat down to wait for her return.</p>
<p>The gossip channels on the tournament circuit were well informed and they were swift.  By the time B'Elanna reached the banquet hall everyone there knew that Lady Hansart was as good as engaged to Charles Kotay.  This explained the behaviour of Lord Beyla during the tournament, and it also meant that for once his attentions would not be exclusively on Lady Hansart during the banquet.  So it was that more than the usual number of young ladies were on hand to greet Beyla at the door to the hall.  B'Elanna paid little attention to the flock of woman who surrounded her and her eyes immediately sought out Annika who was standing next to Kotay while he talked with several of the other competitors.  Annika looked bored to tears as she stood there pale and drawn.  She seemed to sense Beyla's scrutiny and their eyes met as she turned to watch his progress through the hall.  She blushed at his gaze and turned her eyes to the ground.  B'Elanna allowed herself to be led to the other side of the hall where she positioned herself to be able to keep an eye on Annika.  The crowd of young women was not daunted by the knight's apparent disinterest in them and they continued to chatter and flirt with him.  When the band finally began to play B'Elanna allowed herself to be led onto the floor by the first woman who suggested dancing.  They lined up for the Pavan and the dancing began.  It was not long before B'Elanna found herself taking Annika's hand after a partner change.  She felt Annika shiver as their hands met and they bowed to one another.</p>
<p>"Hello Lady Hansart," B'Elanna said, keeping her eyes on Annika's as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Please Lord Beyla, do not speak to me," Annika pleaded afraid she might burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Annika, please give me a chance to explain why..."</p>
<p>"I am begging you Lord Beyla...if you ever truly cared for me you will leave me alone.  I cannot bear this."</p>
<p>B'Elanna saw the tears welling up in Annika's eyes and so she turned her gaze away, falling silent until they changed partners again.</p>
<p>Annika had not thought it was possible to feel more pain than she had at the moment of her discovery of Beyla's deception, but she had been terribly wrong.  Just the sight of her when she came through the door and was surrounded by all of the young ladies of the court had been bad enough, but when she actually touched her hand and felt all of the passion she thought was gone come welling up inside of her she had thought she might die.  She couldn't stop herself from shivering at Beyla's familiar touch, and when she heard his voice she thought she might lose her mind if she did not get away from her.  She was gratified when Beyla obeyed her wishes and stopped trying to talk to her during the dance.  She watched as she left the hall immediately after the dance ended and although she had thought she would be relieved she was shocked to feel a sense of loss when Beyla disappeared from her sight.  She once again found herself standing beside Lord Kotay as he talked to the other knights about the relative merits of horses for the joust.  Finally, unable to stand it any longer she begged his forgiveness and left the hall citing a terrible headache as her reason.  He appeared unconcerned and merely wished her well and returned to his conversation.</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't know what to make of her interaction with Annika tonight.  She had been expecting anger or disinterest, but not the pain she saw clearly displayed on the younger woman's beautiful face.  Annika was suffering as well, and this thought pained B'Elanna greatly.  She had never wanted to hurt Lady Hansart.  She could see no way out of this mess.  If Annika couldn't accept her as she was then they could never be together.  Since Annika appeared to be going along with her father's choice of husbands it would appear that there was little possibility of reconciliation between them, and yet B'Elanna couldn't bring herself to accept that decision.  There had to be a way; if only she could talk to Annika she felt certain she could make the younger woman see that their love transcended such mundane boundaries as gender. If only she could make her see why she had chosen to live her life the way she had, make her see the logic in her reasoning, perhaps then she could convince her to break with her family and make a life with her.  Her mind was spinning, vacillating wildly between hope and despair, pain and joy.  As much as it hurt her to see Annika with someone else, it was preferable to the thought of never seeing her again, and so she returned to her tent to make ready for the next tournament on the circuit.</p>
