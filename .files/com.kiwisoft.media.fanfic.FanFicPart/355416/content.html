<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Sixteen -->

<p>"OK, we?re ready Brooke. What did the Ski Patrol say?" Lily asked as the assembled teens finished putting on their boots and readied their lanterns and equipment. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"They said that she hasn?t been missing long enough and that they have an entire group of skiers lost on the north face that they?re looking for. They told me to keep calm and that she?ll probably be home any minute but if not, call back in a few hours. I don?t want to wait that long. I know how cold it gets out there and Sam?s not used to it. I want to find her now," Brooke explained.</p>
<p>"What?s the plan?" Josh asked as everyone looked to Brooke for instructions. </p>
<p>"We need to stay in teams so no more of us get lost. Don?t wander too far first of all. Second, Mary Cherry, you stay here in case she comes back to the cabin. Lily and Josh go west, Carmen and Harrison go east, south is straight up so I doubt she went that way, Nic and I will go north," Brooke declared.</p>
<p>"Who died and put you in charge?" Nicole demanded to know.</p>
<p>"Either shut the Hell up and cooperate or stay the hell out of my way," Brooke snapped. "I haven?t got time to play your childish games. Sam is lost out there and scared. I can feel it. We need to find her as soon as possible. So get in line and do as you?re told or go back to bed because I don?t need you." Nicole was silent after the tirade.</p>
<p>"OK, everyone ready? Let?s go," Brooke ordered.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam stumbled and tripped, falling to her knees as she tried to maneuver her way through the increasingly thick snow. She was shaking and tired and doubted she?d ever feel warm again. She glanced down at her watch, thankful that it seemed to still be working and figured that she?d been out there for close to six hours. She was cold, tired, hungry and wet.</p>
<p>&lt;Where the Hell am I?&gt; she wondered as she looked around. But all the trees looked the same and she was no closer to finding her way back to the cabin than she was an hour ago.</p>
<p>&lt;Shit, shit, shit on me and my stupid pride. What kind of fool takes off angry in unfamiliar territory? Oh yeah, me&gt; she scolded herself. She wearily got to her feet again, unsure exactly how steady she was since she?d long ago lost feeling in her feet and started forward once more. She tried to keep track of where she was going but the snow seemed to cover her tracks as fast as she made them and she was almost sure that once or twice she?d traveled in a complete circle. The wind howled around her, biting at her nose and ears and making her burrow down further into her parka.</p>
<p>&lt;This is not happening&gt; she told herself. She kept hoping that she was having a really bad nightmare but the cold wetness that had seeped into every inch of clothing and frozen it nearly to her let her know otherwise. That hot tub was looking even better with every exhausted step she took. Her teeth chattered almost painfully as the shivers rocketed though her slight frame. She stumbled again but managed to catch herself against a tree with a mumbled swear as she tried to rub her gloved hands together. But she couldn?t seem to get her arms and hands to cooperate fully. She was starting to get really scared.</p>
<p>&lt;I wish I knew more about hypothermia and stuff. At least then I?d know how much danger I was in&gt; She stumbled a few more feet before her shivering turned violent and she leaned up against a tree for support.</p>
<p>&lt;God, I?m cold&gt; Sam thought sadly. &lt;And I know the shivering is getting worse. I need to find shelter&gt; She blinked fuzzily and looked out into the falling snow.</p>
<p>"Please God," she prayed. "Let me find my way."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>An hour later, there was still no sign of Sam and Brooke was nearly sick with worry. She and Nicole barely spoke to each other as they trudged through the snow near the cabin looking for any sign of the wayward brunette.</p>
<p>"I?m sorry," Nicole whispered finally breaking the stony silence.</p>
<p>"For?"</p>
<p>"If anything happens, it?s my fault," Nicole pointed out guiltily. Brooke stopped walking and stared at her.</p>
<p>"You?re right, it is," she snapped. "You?d better pray to God we find her all right. Or I will MAKE you pay."</p>
<p>"You really do love her, don?t you?" Nicole asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes. And despite yourself, you care for her too or you wouldn?t be out here," Brooke retorted.</p>
<p>"Yes," Nicole admitted while hanging her head. She was also worried sick that something bad had happened to Sam.</p>
<p>"So tell me, how does it feel to get caught in your own trap?" Brooke asked angrily. Nicole shook her head but said nothing. She walked on looking for Sam.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>&lt;Ya know what? This ain?t MY fault. Thisss isss all Nic?sss fault&gt; Sam decided two hours later, her thought processes being effected by the prolonged cold. She let out an absurd giggle.</p>
<p>"Swerv her write," she frowned. Her mouth and lips felt frozen. "SERVE," she enunciated to no one in particular. "Serve her RIGHT." She giggled again and removed her hat. She was starting to sweat badly.</p>
<p>&lt;It?s snowin? an? I?m sweating. Go fig&gt; she thought with a quiet laugh. &lt;Well, at least ?m not shiverin? s? much. Tha? was annoyin?. Wonder where I am. Wonder if anyone?s lookin? fer me? Eh, who cares? Nobody else does. Not even Brooke&gt; Sam sighed at the thought of her blonde friend. </p>
<p>&lt;I should have told her th? truth. I love her and she shoulda known. I?&gt; The rest of her thought was cut off as she tripped over a branch hidden under the snow and struck her head. She peacefully surrendered to the blackness pulling at her.</p>
