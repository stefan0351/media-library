<!--Coffee? Donut? Confession?-->

<p>"Excuse me, I'm Officer Bennett.  Can either of you tell me
what happened here tonight?" Nicole heard the cop and looked at
Harrison who looked back at her expectantly.  She knew he was waiting
for her to say something.  The greedy, self-preservist side of
herself was screaming at her to walk away but the other half was
yelling to do the right thing and it had been a while since she'd
last heard from that other half.  She heard Brooke's words echoing
over and over inside her mind and realized that for once, the great
Nicole Julian didn't have a way out of a mess of her own creation.
She couldn't shift the blame to anyone else like Mary Cherry or Sugar
Daddy.  She couldn't say she did it out of anger at Sam or...&lt;Oh, God,
Sam!  What have I done?&gt; She repeated her earlier question.  </p>

<p>True she never really liked the would-be-journalist and the girl's
unique brand of vitriol but Nicole had to admit the girl was
something unique herself.  No matter how many doors were slammed in
her face or how many times she was put upon or pushed down, Sam never
seemed to get anything more than a ding or a scratch in her paint.
If a door shut, Sam opened a window or made her own door and even
Nicole had to admire that.  And she did, not that she would admit it
if you ever asked.  Sam was brave and had a sort of courage most
people only read about.  She just kept plugging along, going after
the things she believed in and not backing down or compromising her
convictions.  And now Nicole had gone and probably killed her.  &lt;Oh,
God, what do I do now?&gt; Nicole took a deep breath and grew up.</p>

<p>"I was upset and got drunk.  Took my car out.  Then I saw Brooke
McQueen and tried to run her down.  Sam McPherson pushed her out of
the way so I hit her instead," she confessed softly to Officer
Bennett.  Harrison gaped at her in shock.  Officer Bennett shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Did I hear you correctly Miss...?"</p>

<p>"Julian.  Nicole Julian and yes, I'd like to make a total and
complete confession.  I want a blood alcohol test done now, be
checked out because I crashed my car over there," she pointed at the
wreckage of her car, "and then I'll go with you to the station."</p>

<p>"Nicole," Harrison started.  He couldn't believe his ears.  Nicole
Julian, who always blamed everyone else for her mistakes, was taking
full responsibilty for the worst one of her young life.  She turned
and looked at him with a small smile.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know.  How'd have thought, right?  Me, doing the Spike
Lee `Do the right thing' crap.  I'm obviously drunk and not in my
right mind.  I must have hit my head pretty hard," she paused and
became serious.  "Harrison, look, I know I have no right to ask but,
would you do one thing for me?"  Still in shock, Harrison nodded.  </p>

<p>"Thanks, keep an eye on Brooke for me, would you?  I know I can never
fix this, God help me, but I can at least do this.  I can admit that
I did this.  But Brooke is going to need someone to help her through
it.  God help us all if Sam doesn't make it." Harrison stared at her
for a second like she'd grown a second head and she sighed.</p>

<p>"Look, hate me if you want to, that's nothing new.  Now I've really
given you a reason to, but please, just be there for the both of
them.  That's all I'm asking."  </p>

<p>"Sure, Nicole.  You know, you almost seem human," he told her
humorlessly.  She smiled with just as much humor.  </p>

<p>"Thanks, Harrison.  And please let everyone know how truly sorry I am
for what I've done," She turned back to the police officer and held
out her hands.  "Book me, Danno."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brooke stood by as the paramedics placed Sam in a c-collar and on a
backboard as they treated what injuries they needed to before moving
her.  She was still semi-conscious, trying to answer questions when
asked and calling for Brooke when the other girl lost her grip on her
hand.  Brooke felt it was a special kind of torture to see the kind
of pain Sam was in and not be able to do anything about it.</p>

<p>"Brooke..." Sam called weakly as a sudden fit of coughing overcame
her.  Brooke watched in horror as blood poured more freely from Sam's
mouth.  She grasped Sam's hand tightly.</p>

<p>"Right here, Sammy, I haven't gone anywhere.  Hang on, OK?" her calm
from earlier was beginning to give way to bubbling panic.  Sam
visibly relaxed.</p>

<p>"Tell Mom I'm sorry," Sam whispered.  Brooke fought down the rising
panic that those words stirred within her.</p>

<p>"Sam, don't.  You're going to be fine," she watched as Sam gave her a
weak wry smile.</p>

<p>"Liar.  You...suck...at lying," Sam managed to tease as she weakened
further.</p>

<p>"Excuse us, miss, but we have to be going," a paramedic told Brooke
gently.  Sam gripped Brooke's hand as tightly as she could.</p>

<p>"Please...please don't leave me..." she begged.  "I'm scared."
Brooke felt the tears finally being to course down her cheeks at the
fraility in Sam's voice.</p>

<p>"I'm not going anywhere, Sweetie," Brooke reassured her.  She looked
around for Harrison and found him standing awkwardly a few feet away.</p>

<p>  "Harrison, please call our parents and have them meet us there.
Then call the gang.  We're going to need all the support we can get,
OK?" Harrison nodded.</p>

<p>"Anything, Brooke, we'll meet you there," he told her confidently,
somewhat sorry that he couldn't go with them but honored and humbled
that she was trusting him with the important job of calling
everyone.  He knew it wouldn't be easy and he immediately decided
that he would go straight over to the McQueen's house to tell them.
There was no way he could tell them this over the phone.  Brooke
spared him a small smile.</p>

<p>"Thanks," she said as he watched the doors close and the bus pull
away.  Left alone in the street for a few minutes, Harrison took in
the scene around him.  There were spectators on the street with him,
oggling the carnage like vultures and it pissed him off.  There were
scraps of clothes and bandages soaked in blood left on the ground and
it took the remainder of his composure not to retch as the reality of
the situation came home.  He shook off his anger and disgust and the
last thing he saw as he turned to leave was Nicole in handcuffs,
being read her rights at a nearby squad car.  Idly he wondered
exactly how many lives had just been destroyed in one single instant.</p>
