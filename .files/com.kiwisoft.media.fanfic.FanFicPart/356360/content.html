<!-- About a Girl \ Part 29 -->

<p><u><i>Karen's House . A Lazy Mid-Summer Afternoon</i></u></p>

<p>"You're quiet," Jessie said as they walked into her room.  They had
been hanging out at Booklovers torturing Judy and scamming free
caffeine, but that had gotten boring . alright they'd gotten kicked
out . so they'd been forced to find something more productive to do
with their time.  Which meant hanging out a Jessie's house, and most
likely watching Jenny Jones.  Yes, summer vacation had arrived and it
was good.</p>

<p>"I guess I am," Katie agreed a moment later after pausing to consider
Jessie's statement for a moment.  "Hmmm.  Apparently I am capable of
being serious, every now and then," she continued unperturbed.</p>

<p>"What's to be serious about?" Jessie asked hovering by her lamp
debating whether or not to turn it on before finally deciding not
to.  There was enough light streaming into the room through the
curtains that they could see each other, and she kind of liked the
romantic mood the darkened surroundings created.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie said turning towards her looking somewhat
confused.  "It just feels like a serious time I suppose.  Not a bad
serious," she continued calmly as Jessie moved towards her, looking
at her keenly.  "Just like an attitude of respect is required or
something."</p>

<p>"That's okay," Jessie breathed out softly, "I like serious on you,"
she continued raising her hand to stroke Katie's check lightly.  "You
look so calm.  It's beautiful."</p>

<p>"Hmph," Katie exhaled softly, her lips curving up in a little smile
as she tilted her head down slightly.</p>

<p>"Have I finally embarrassed you?" Jessie asked happily, a smile
spreading across her features too as she looked at her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Not embarrassed," Katie replied tilting her head back up to look at
Jessie, her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"Then what?" Jessie asked softly as Katie continued to stare at her
thoughtfully yet blissfully.</p>

<p>"More like astounded," Katie breathed out finally, her lips twitching
slightly.  "All the time, every time, whenever I'm around you," she
continued now smiling as she regarded Jessie.</p>

<p>"Why?" Jessie asked unable to tear her eyes away from Katie's starkly
intimate gaze.</p>

<p>"Because I love you," Katie responded her eyes holding Jessie's for a
moment, and it was really as simple as that.  "And that's a very
astounding thing."</p>

<p>Jessie regarded her for a minute after that, taking in the blissful
look on her girlfriend's flawless face, and smiled herself.  Then
slowly yet without hesitation leaned forward and brought her lips to
Katie's, pressing their bodies together as her hands came to rest on
the side of her face.  And then she ran her tongue along Katie's lips
tracing and tasting them, before moving to kiss her way along Katie's
jaw-line and then down to her neck where her tongue snuck out and
licked a path up to lips that she never, ever wanted to stop kissing.</p>

<p>Katie watched as Jessie stepped back, her girlfriend's hands falling
to her waist and resting there as she watched her.  "It's quiet in
here," she said softly, as if she had just suddenly become aware of
the silence in the house.</p>

<p>"We're the only ones here," Jessie replied still watching her, her
hands slowly slipping underneath the material of Katie's tank top,
her thumbs brushing against the smooth, warm skin she found
underneath, teasing it with soft, gentle strokes.</p>

<p>"I knew that," Katie replied, acutely aware of the feel of Jessie's
hands on her stomach but nonetheless keeping her eyes on her
girlfriends face, studying her, instead of looking down.  "I was just
saying."</p>

<p>Jessie nodded absently, then began to push the material of Katie's
tank top up, leisurely, revealing more and more of her girlfriend's
skin, her eyes trained intently on the now exposed flesh.  </p>

<p>"Can I?" she asked softly a moment later, her eyebrow quirking up
slightly as she looked up at Katie.  She had pushed the material up
to the point where the only thing left to do was take the top off.</p>

<p>Katie regarded her for a second, then simply nodded before lifting up
her arms to allow Jessie to pull the top up and off of her, leaving
her standing there in only her bra and cream capri pants.  </p>

<p>As she stood there she became highly aware of the rise and fall of
her chest that accompanied her every breath, and she could sense
Jessie's eyes on her in the very marrow of her bones as the blonde
stood there watching her breathe, raking her eyes over her.  And, she
was extremely aware of the way the air was caressing her skin and the
pleasant chills it caused to ripple throughout her body.</p>

<p>And then Jessie's lips were on hers once more, and her own hands
enthusiastically trailed their way up Jessie's sides, brushing across
the front of her chest, before slipping around to her back and coming
to rest on the blonde's hips as they broke apart, their breathing
ragged and uneven.  She fingered the thin material of Jessie's shirt
meditatively, and then wrapped her arms around Jessie's waist
dragging the girl back into her.   With that taken care of she then
returned her lips Jessie's, kissing her ardently as Jessie moved her
hand to cover Katie's drawing both of their hands under her shirt and
upwards.</p>

<p>With Jessie's hand over hers, keeping it firmly in place Katie
brushed her thumb across the material of Jessie's bra, her breath
hitching in her throat as she saw Jessie's mouth open and heard a
soft moan escape from the blonde's slightly parted lips.  Swaying
closer, intoxicated by Jessie, she rested her head against her
girlfriend's forehead and moved her thumb again, inhaling sharply as
Jessie attached her lips to her neck, sucking and licking at the skin
of her neck desperately as she pressed forward into Katie's hand.</p>

<p>Pulling back slightly when Katie's hand stilled, Jessie looked up at
her, her eyes stormy but focused.  "Come on," she said quietly, her
fingers hooking into the tabs of Katie's pants as she began to drag
her towards the bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>"You're quiet," Jessie whispered her eyes focused on her finger as
she trailed it down along Katie's naked torso, carelessly drawing
shapes on Katie's damp skin as she listened to her girlfriend's now
rhythmic breathing.</p>

<p>"Uh," followed by a deep breath was Katie's response.  Jessie smiled
and turned her head up to look at Katie's face.  She was staring at
the ceiling, and hadn't formed a full word in over five minutes.  </p>

<p>Jessie shifted upwards, and rested her head on Katie's shoulder,
drawing the sheet up around them before draping her arm across her
girlfriend's body.  There were no words to describe what she was
feeling, she hadn't even been aware previously that there were
feelings comparable to what she was feeling.  She felt so real, like
she was aware of every atom in her body, every electron and proton
and shooting about, like for the first time she was truly aware of
her body, of herself.  And at the same time she felt like she was in
a dream, painted with watercolours that were dripping warmly around
her covering her in their dreamy colours, like this world was too
perfect to actually exist.</p>

<p>"Billie," Katie said softly, her voice bringing Jessie out of her
reflections.  "I think I've gone stupid," she continued, not sounding
terribly concerned about it, as she felt Jessie shift to look up at
her.</p>

<p>"What're you talking about?" Jessie asked looking over at Katie as
she blinked up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I can't," Katie started.  "My mind just won't .work.  It's like when
I broke my arm and the doctor put me on morphine only he gave me too
much.  I feel like that, only better.  And.more tingly," she
continued, highly and pleasantly aware of the feel of Jessie's bare
skin pressed against the side of her body and the excited feeling it
caused inside of her.</p>

<p>"Are you saying I'm like a drug?" Jessie asked leaning over and
pressing a chaste kiss to Katie's cheek, completely in awe of Katie's
reaction to what they had just shared.</p>

<p>"No," Katie breathed out softly, looking up into Jessie's
eyes.  "Drugs should like be totally jealous of you.  There's some
Columbian cocaine huddled in the corner of a bathroom crying it's
eyes out right now," she continued, her eyes closing as a smile
spread across her face.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Jessie mumbled in response before burying her head in the
crook of Katie's neck and drawing her arms around the other girl even
tighter.  "I love you," she continued feeling Katie kiss to top of
her head.</p>

<p>"I love you too," Katie, replied her eyes drifting back to the
ceiling dreamily.  "I love you times infinity," she declared.</p>

<p>"I love you times infinity plus one," Jessie whispered softly kissing
Katie's collarbone.</p>

<p>"Dammit," Katie exclaimed, a smile spreading across her face.  She
always forgot about the plus one, Jessie always beat her with the
plus one.</p>

<p>"You're funny," Jessie mumbled, her hand tracing the side of Katie's
torso absently, marveling at the feel of her skin.</p>

<p>"You think so huh?" Katie replied looking down at the top of Jessie's
head.  "You wanna know what's really funny?"</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked knowing that Katie was going to say something
completely stupid and that she was going to find it highly amusing
anyway, cause that was just the way things worked.</p>

<p>"The Sandra Bernhard Experience," Katie replied.  "Why'd they cancel
that?" </p>

<p>"You know," Jessie replied, trying not to laugh.  "I think I liked it
better when you were speechless," she continued laying her head back
down on Katie's shoulder blissfully.  </p>
