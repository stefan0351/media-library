<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - Leaving On A Jet Plane -->

<p>Eight days later Sam finally felt almost human again. Unfortunately that was
about the best thing she could say about herself. She was packed and ready to
go. Jane appeared in her door, disapproving look on her face. </p>
<p>"Are you absolutely sure about this?" Sam sighed. If her mother asked her
that one more time... </p>
<p>"For the four millionth time, no, I'm not, but it has to be done," she turned
to face her mother. "He said it, not me. I can't stay here, Mom. You and Brooke
stand to lose everything if I do. I won't let that happen." </p>
<p>"At least wait until Brooke gets home from practice," Jane begged. Sam shook
her head. </p>
<p>"If I do that I'll never leave. No, Mom, I gotta go now while she's not here.
I know it's cowardly but I have to." She walked over and hugged her mother.
"Please stick to our agreement. Don't tell her where I went and don't call
unless it's an emergency. I'll call every few days to check on you and Brooke
and you can fill me in, OK?" Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I don't like it, but all right. You're going to be hurting her, you know,"
Sam nodded sadly and a few tears slipped down her cheeks. </p>
<p>"I know. But losing Mike will hurt more. I know what it's like to lose your
Dad and I won't let Brooke go through that if I can stop it. Have you noticed
them lately? They're tearing each other apart. They make any fight Brooke and I
ever had look like spitball fights in comparison. It's awful and they're going
to damage their relationship beyond repair if it keeps up. I won't let that
happen," she looked up at her mother, her brown eyes pleading. "Please help her
understand." </p>
<p>"I'll do my best, honey. Honest." </p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom. And try to fix things with Mike, yourself. He's a nice guy, in
there somewhere. I won't be ground zero for this nuclear family." She headed
down the stairs to the car. Jane stopped her at the door. </p>
<p>"If it means anything to you, honey, you're father would be proud of the way
you stood up for yourself and I think he'd be fine with you and Brooke as long
as you were happy." A genuine smile lit up Sam's face for the first time since
telling Mike about her and Brooke's relationship. </p>
<p>"You know it does mean something, Mom. And somehow, I know he would be OK,"
finally she was starting to understand the message Joe had given her while she
was in a coma. `Pain is temporary, love is forever.' It didn't make this
decision any easier though. </p>
<p>"You'll call when you get there?" Jane asked as she hugged Sam again. She
hated the idea of saying good-bye to Sam. Somehow the whole situation struck her
as wrong, Sam shouldn't be leaving, running away. She should be staying and
fighting for Brooke. But things were getting worse and not better with Mike and
she could see Sam's point. Sometimes the best thing to do is to step away and
give people some room. </p>
<p>"Of course," Sam answered. She fixed her mother with an intense stare. "You
will take care of her right? Don't let her do anything stupid. I'm doing this so
that you both can fix things with Mike, OK? But I'm worried that she's going to
think I'm abandoning her like her mother did. Please make sure she knows that
isn't the case," Sam begged. Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I'll try but you know you can avoid the whole thing if you just stay." Sam
sighed and frowned. </p>
<p>"Please just stop that, I feel bad enough all ready. My mind is made up. I'm
going. Mike isn't going to calm down as long as I'm here. He's bound and
determined to blame me for this whole thing, so remove me from the equation and
maybe you and Brooke can find some resolutions." </p>
<p>"All right," Jane conceeded. "Well, you'd better get going if you want to
miss the worse traffic and be gone before Brooke gets home." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"I love you, Mom. And I'l come home soon, I promise. Take care of yourself
and Mac and especially Brooke for me," she said with a sad smile. Jane smiled
through her tears as Sam climbed in her car. </p>
<p>"I will, honey, and take care of yourself." Sam waved and pulled out of the
driveway. (Well,) Jane thought (This will either make them, or break them) </p>

<p>Brooke bounded up the stairs after practice excited to see Sam who was
finally feeling better after a bad bout with the flu. She entered Sam's room to
find it empty. Not just lacking in an occupant, but devoid of many of Sam's
belongings; her Cds, laptop, school stuff, her dressers were cleaned off and,
upon inspection, her closets were nearly empty. Dread and fear filled Brooke at
the thought that her father had finally thrown Sam out of the house when a small
envelope taped to Sam's vanity with her name written on it caught her eye. </p>
<p>She opened the envelope carefully and started reading. And heard her entire
world crash down around her feet. </p>
<i>
<p><br>
Dear Brooke, </p>
<p>
First and foremost, I love you more than anything or anyone on this Earth.
Please know this. There isn't a part of me that doesn't love you. I never
thought it possible to love someone, need someone as much as I do you. It scares
me sometimes, but I would never trade it for anything. And I would never hurt
you. I'd die before I'd let that happen or let anyone else do it either. I think
I proved that with Nicole. But even having said all that, this is something I
have to do. I can't sit by and watch you and your father destroy yourselves.
</p>
<p>I loved my dad a lot, still do and not a day goes by that I
don't wish he was still here to talk to, laugh with, sit with or just be with. I
envy the relationship you and Mike have and I refuse to be what destroys it. I'm
not willing to give up on us either but there has to be some sort of middle
ground.</p>
<p>It's obvious that with me around, Mike's not going to be
willing to talk to you or Mom about this insane situation we've found ourselves
in. Don't you find it highly ironic that we wasted all that time trying to find
ways to break them apart when all we had to do was face how we really felt for
each other and it would have done it for us? Not funny, I know, but still.</p>
<p>I care about Mike, and I know my Mom really loves him so I
will not be the reason she loses him. And I need to think about little Mac too.
You and I both grew up in single parent households and I won't make her suffer
through that if I can prevent it.</p>
<p>So here's my warped Sam McPherson logic: if I give Mike
some time and space, maybe you and he can talk this out without me as an added
distraction. He needs to get this straight (no pun intended). Whether you love
me or not, Brooke, you've accepted the fact that you're gay, that won't change.
Make him start with accepting that. Accepting me is secondary. Your relationship
with your Dad is important and I won't let you lose it because of me.</p>
<p>Listen to him, give him a chance to air his concerns and
fears, however bigoted and homophobic they may be. He is entitled to them. Deep
down, he still loves you and nothing will change that, not even me. He just
needs time, Brooke. We just need to be willing to give it to him.</p>
<p>I am in no way abandoning you. Just the opposite. I will be with you every
step of the way, I just think it'd be easier for all concerned if I step away
for a while and let you and your dad get reaquainted. Don't ask Mom where I
went, she won't tell you. I asked her not to so that you and Mike can have the
time you need, but I will be calling to check on you often.</p>
<p>Please don't be mad at me for doing this. This decision
wasn't easy but it's the only solution I could find that didn't involve a
straight jacket for Mike, ending Mom and Mike's engagement or destroying your
relationship with your Dad completely. Maybe I'm being selfish, cowardly even,
running away like this. I don't know anymore. All I do know is that I love you
with all my heart and soul. And I will come home to you.</p>
<p>Until then, take care, Princess. Remember that I love you.</p>
<p>Your Love Forever, </p>
<p>Sam McPherson </p></i>

Brooke could see where the ink was smudged from where Sam's tears had fallen as
she had written the letter. And now her own tears added to the smudges. She was
angry, hurt, scared, and deeply touched all at the same time. </p>
<p>"Are you all right?" Jane asked from the doorway where she'd been silently
observing the girl. Brooke turned around, eyes streaming rivers of tears and
Jane walked over to wrap the girl in a hug. </p>
<p>"Shhhh, it'll be all right, you'll see," she soothed the sobbing girl. </p>
<p>"She's gone," Brooke mourned. "My Sammy left me." Jane rubbed the girls'
back. </p>
<p>"It'll work out, Brooke, you'll see," only thing was, Jane had no idea how.</p>
