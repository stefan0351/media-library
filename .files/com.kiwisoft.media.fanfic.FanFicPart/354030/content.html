<!-- Starlight \ Part 13 -->

<p>&#34;What are you thinking about?&#34; Willow asked looking over at Buffy who was facing the television but clearly not watching it.</p>

<p>The sun had just set and they were Giles's bedroom-which seemed to be their designated area of late-watching the television. An old episode of Star Trek the Next Generation was on, but Buffy had tuned it out. She had started to watch it, but then she gotten distracted by something shiny and when she turned back to television the crew was in Victorian England and she couldn't figure out how it happened.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing really,&#34; Buffy responded looking over at Willow who was stretched out on the bed. Buffy, was seated in her chair beside the bed. &#34;My mind's as blank as…something that's blank a lot,&#34; Buffy continued lamely.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you feel anything?&#34; Willow asked watching her intently.</p>

<p>Giles had told them that the reaction from the serum wouldn't be immediate, he had guessed that it would take a number of hours, maybe even a day before Buffy began to get the use of her legs back.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment as she concentrated on taking stock of what her body was feeling. After a moment she looked over at Willow and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't think enough time has passed,&#34; Buffy said softly. The statement was true enough, but both of them really didn't care about the validity of the statement they just wanted Buffy to have her legs back.</p>

<p>Willow nodded.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, it's only been a couple of hours,&#34; she said lying back down but keeping her eyes fixed on Buffy. &#34;Why don't you come lie down?&#34; Willow asked. She could definitely use some snuggles.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy responded, but she sounded distracted and made no move to actually get on the bed. &#34;Before though…I just wanted to…&#34; she trailed off shaking her head at her own inability to just say what she meant. &#34;Could we just talk for a minute?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Willow said sitting up. There was a seriousness in Buffy's voice that made her apprehensive. Suddenly she found herself wondering Buffy was having second thoughts about what had happened between them in the morning. After Giles had made the injection, they had all sat around for while talking-actually they had all sat around and listened to Xander regale Buffy with a tale of his heroics-which hadn't really given Willow and Buffy a chance to talk about what they had done or said earlier. Then once Xander had gone home, and Spike had gone out to wallow at Willy's, Willow and Buffy had come back to the bedroom to rest. But, much to Willow's chagrin Buffy didn't seem to want to talk about what had happened between them, or of anything of significance really. After exhausting all the channels of useless chit chat they had access to they had settled into silence watching the television.</p>

<p>But that was almost an hour ago, and Willow needed to talk. She needed to find out what was going on inside of Buffy's head, and more importantly inside of Buffy's heart.</p>

<p>&#34;About what…happened this morning,&#34; Buffy started looking down at her stocking feet. &#34;I just…if this doesn't work, this serum thing, and I don't get my legs back, I just want you know that…&#34; she faltered here, not wanting to say the words she was going to, but feeling that they should be said. &#34;…that I won't hold you to what you said this morning. We can just pretend like it never happened,&#34; Buffy finished never lifting her eyes from her feet.</p>

<p>Willow stared at her for a moment in state of complete shock.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you really think that little of me? Of yourself?&#34; Willow asked a moment later. She had thought that her tone would have been angrier, but it wasn't, it was more disillusioned. She now understood why Buffy had been so reluctant to talk since they got back. She was afraid that if she didn't get her legs back, she wouldn't want her anymore. It was the most ridiculous thing Willow had ever heard, but it broke her heart.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at her finally when Willow posed those questions.</p>

<p>&#34;I…it has nothing to do with how much or how little I think of you, or myself,&#34; Buffy responded softly. &#34;I think the world of you…I love you,&#34; she continued plaintively. &#34;And I know that this,&#34; she said gesturing to her current position, &#34;couldn't have been what you had in mind when…if you ever considered what a relationship with me might be like.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow dropped down off of the bed after Buffy had finished speaking and knelt in front of the Slayer.</p>

<p>&#34;Obviously, those nights that I lay awake wondering what it would be like to be with you it wasn't like this,&#34; Willow started gesturing to their current situation. &#34;There was no reason to think of it like this…but it doesn't matter,&#34; she continued. &#34;It wasn't the being on a beach in Fiji part, or lying by the fire part of the dreams that was important…it was the being with Buffy part that made it magical,&#34; Willow said taking Buffy's hand into hers. &#34;And it's the being with Buffy part that's important now, and I am and it's wonderful,&#34; Willow went on in an reverent tone. &#34;I hope with all of my heart that this serum works, because I've spent a considerable amount of time thinking about all of the bad that will come if it doesn't and…but never, ever, would this or anything else change the way that I feel about you,&#34; she finished.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment after Willow finished speaking. There was just one last thing nagging at her, one last worry that she couldn't shake and for the life of her she didn't know how to bring it up in delicate way. It was just too…</p>

<p>&#34;Just…what if…you know I may…&#34; Buffy started to say, then she just stopped trying to bring herself together. &#34;What if I can't…you know…consummate the relationship?&#34; she asked her voice dropping to a whisper.</p>

<p>Willow smiled, that sweet, irresistible, sexy, completely Willow smile that could melt the hardest of hearts, even in deepest depths of a Siberian mineshaft in the middle of night in December.</p>

<p>&#34;Is that what you're really worried about?&#34; she asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;Well,&#34; Buffy said a little defensively. &#34;There's also the not being able to save the world, and fight demons and stuff…I mean those are serious concerns as well,&#34; she went on avoiding Willow's gaze.</p>

<p>Willow stood up and lowered herself onto Buffy's lap. Something she seemed to be doing a lot of lately, and something they both seemed to be partial to. Buffy looked at her quizzically but didn't say anything as Willow settled herself. Once she was settled Willow leaned in and brought their lips together in a sweet, tender, passionate, hungry kiss that had both of them arching forward trying to increase the contact between them so that they could further devour each other. It was one of those all-consuming kisses where sparks erupted behind their eye lids and their hearts felt as if they would beat out their chests, and they weren't sure if they were in heaven or still on earth.</p>

<p>&#34;You feel that?&#34; Willow asked placing her hand over Buffy's heart once they broke apart.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded her answer trying to get her breathing under control.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't think that…consummation is going to be a problem,&#34; Willow said grinning. &#34;In fact I think we almost consummated a minute ago,&#34; she went on her grin taking on a lecherous leaning.</p>

<p>Buffy stared at Willow for a moment, then broke out into a huge smile and leaned forward resting her head against Willow's chest.</p>

<p>&#34;Tell me about it,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;I think I'm still consummating,&#34; she added chuckling. Her breathing still hadn't returned to it's regular routine and she doubted that as long as she was this close to Willow that it would.</p>

<p>&#34;Which brings me back to my original question,&#34; Willow commented planting a kiss on the top of Buffy's head.</p>

<p>&#34;You had a question?&#34; Buffy asked genuinely perplexed.</p>

<p>&#34;Why don't you come lie down,&#34; Willow clarified.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh that,&#34; Buffy responded tilting her head up so that she was looking up into Willow's eyes. &#34;I think that's a very good idea. Excellent actually.&#34;</p>
