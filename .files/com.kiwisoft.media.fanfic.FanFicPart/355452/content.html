<p>Sam has been acting so weird around me these last few weeks. It doesn?t seem like she?s mad at me, but still she keeps avoiding me for some reason. She hardly ever speaks to me anymore, and when she has no choice, she refuses to look me in the eyes.</p>
<p>I?m pretty sure this whole mess has something to do with those dreams of hers. Yes, I know about her late-night encounters, how could I not? She?s always moaning and groaning so loud, you?d think she was intent on waking up the whole neighborhood. So far, she?s only succeeded in waking up me, although she?s done that plenty of times. I?m actually considering wearing earmuffs to bed from now on. At least I?ll be able to get my beauty-rest then.</p>
<p>True, it annoys me that she wakes me up almost every night, but it bothers me even more that she won?t tell me what?s wrong. I tried getting her to talk to me numerous times, but I always get the same reply. "It?s nothing." Or "I?m ok Brooke, don?t worry about it." Stupid emotional walls!</p>
<p>Why won?t she talk to me? I can tell that something?s wrong, and I?m afraid that it has to do with me. I haven?t got a clue as to what it could be, but with all the avoiding it?s kind of obvious that I am, in some crazy way, the reason.</p>
<p>This is so frustrating! Sometimes I just want to grab her and shake her till she starts talking. Probably wouldn?t do much good anyway. I?d only succeed in making her mad at me, thus ruining any possibility of getting her to open up. I?m just so sick of butting my head against those walls of hers. I?ve done it so many times I?m surprised that my skull hasn?t cracked open yet.</p>
<p>Well, she?ll probably be heading to bed in an hour of so. Better go find those earmuffs.</p>

<p>Sam, you?re a sweet kid and I care very much about you, but right now you are PISSING ME OFF! Still won?t talk to me, continues to have those dreams, and she?s gotten louder. I didn?t think it was possible, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>The earmuffs didn?t do any good. I tried using earplugs instead last night, but I got the same result. I swear the walls in this house are made of paper! At least this time she stopped around 4 Am, so I finally got some sleep.</p>
<p>I know I seem a little cranky, but sleeping only 2 ? 3 hours a night for two months tends to do that to a person. Anyway, I gotta get to Glamazon practice.</p>
<p><b>May 28<sup>th</sup> 6:20 Pm</b></p>
<p>Ok, now I?m sure this has something to do with me. When I came back from practice, Sam was in the kitchen. Since I didn?t have time to stretch out properly at school, I just did it in the kitchen. I swear I could hear Sam?s jaw hit the floor when I did that. She looked at me like I just sprouted an extra head or something! Then she stood up, stuttered something about homework and raced out of the room like the devil himself was on her heels. What the Hell is going on?!</p>
<p>For crying out loud Sammy! Why won?t you talk to me? I wish she would just tell me what I?ve done wrong. Until she does that how am I supposed to know how to fix it?</p>
<p>I?m beginning to get a little broody these days. I find myself totally zoning in class, more than usually I mean. It?s always these same thoughts swimming around in my head: Sam and her dreams. I can?t help but wonder who it is that causes her to make such a racket every night? After wondering about that for a while, I start wishing it was me. What?s up with that? Don?t get me wrong; Sam?s a very attractive girl, beautiful even. Even Nic admitted to that at some point. But she?s my sister! She will be in time anyway.</p>
<p>I can?t fall for her, I know that. But I think it?s too late, I already have. God, Nic would have a purple cow if she knew this. Not to mention the Southern Hell, she?d start preaching right away. And Sam! Whoa boy, she would probably run away screaming.</p>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Alright, that?s it! She?s at it again. I need my sleep and I can?t get it because of her trashing about. Sam, I love you but I?m tired and I need my rest! I?m going in!</font></p>
