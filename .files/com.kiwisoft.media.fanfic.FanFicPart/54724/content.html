<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 18: Visiting and Learning-->

<p>Willow, Buffy, and Oz were in Giles' car on their way to UC Sunnydale. They were going for two reasons. The main reason was because the college had a large collection of occult material and in some respects, was more comprehensive than the library. The second reason was because they both wanted to check out the campus.</P>
<p>They were going to go there for the next four years, so they wanted to get to know the campus, and find a place to stay. They were both smiling, because they realized they had almost achieved their goal. A lot had happened, but they had gotten through it, and they would get through whatever happened from here on out too.</P>
<p>Giles and Wesley had both decided that this weekend would be a good time to do serious research on the Mayor and his plans. Giles had taken them, and Wesley had taken Xander and Cordelia to The city's Hall of Records building. They had actually drawn straws to see who would get stuck with Wesley, and it seemed fitting that they would be the ones to go with him.</P>
<p>"Are you sure you saw nothing of use in the Deputy Mayor's office, Willow?" Giles asked.</P>
<p>"All his file cabinets were empty, but…"</P>
<p>"What?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"There were torn scraps of paper in his trash."</P>
<p>"You rooted the guy's trash? You have my kudos." Oz smirked.</P>
<p>"Hey, I'm thorough."</P>
<p>"I can vouch for that." Buffy said, grinning.</P>
<p>Willow was getting better at suppressing the blushes that wanted to creep onto her face from time to time. So, she just grinned back giving Buffy a look that could've melted butter.</P>
<P>"Yes, can we get back to…" Giles started.</P>
<p>"Sorry, so anyway, it said something on it. Ascention…. Asceation…"</P>
<p>"Ascension?"</P>
<p>"That was it."</P>
<p>Giles was quiet.</P>
<p>"What is it?" Oz asked.</P>
<p>"I'm not sure."</P>
<p>"Usually when he says that, it means it's something really bad." Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"How'd I know you'd pick the shortest straw?" Cordelia half asked, half yelled.</P>
<p>"The same way I knew you'd pick the next to shortest straw so I'd get stuck with you." Xander retorted.</P>
<p>They were looking in several volumes of town history. It was surprising that in a town full of demons pretty detailed records were kept. Wesley was trying to talk the clerk of the building into letting him see the older records on file, because the ones out for public viewing seemed to start from fifty years before, and not go any further back.</P>
<p>They consisted of town censuses, and mysteriously left out all the odd occurrences that they knew had happened. The strangest thing so far was that there were no election records, or any record of the Mayor's election, for that matter.</P>
<p>"Anyone else see a conspiracy theme here?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>Wesley walked into the room, trying to hide his rage.</P>
<p>"Yes, that does seem to be the case, doesn't it?"</P>
<p>"What'd he say?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"He absolutely refused at the start, and then I brought up the Freedom Of Information Act of your country. That seemed to shock him into submission. I think he was surprised that a foreigner knew your laws."</P>
<p>"Hell, I don't even know this country's laws." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Freedom of what?" Cordelia was puzzled.</P>
<p>Wesley sighed. </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The college was beautiful. As they went past the gate up the long driveway, the main building seemed to just appear from nowhere beyond the trees, and a fountain was situated in the courtyard, crystal clear water flowing from its two pumps.</P>
<p>Besides the main building, containing various lounges, computer labs, and music rooms, and various classrooms used for foreign language classes, there were four other buildings situated together. The science building was to the left, the English one was to the right, and the Criminal Justice building behind it. </P>
<p>Further away from those buildings were two other complexes. One was dedicated to athletics, and the other, older building was of course, the library. The apartments and dorms were available through shuttled transportation back and forth. </P>
<p>"It's bigger than I thought." Buffy said. </P>
<p>"That's why I don't trust those view books they send out. Full of lies." Oz said.</P>
<p>"I'll be in the library. We'll meet up later?" Giles said.</P>
<p>"Sure. Come on, we know we're accepted, maybe they'll let us set up our schedules." Willow said, dragging Buffy by the hand toward the main building.</P>
<p>"Help." Buffy said to Oz. He just grinned and walked behind them at a casual pace.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"'I'm gonna take Chemistry as a minor and Computer Science as a major. I was gonna take Physics, but Chemistry can help me with the witch stuff." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Well good, because if I've learned anything in high school it's that the laws of physics can be broken, and therefore, it's a waste of time." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"I bet if every teacher in the world knew what you knew, nothing would apply. But that would destroy the whole educational system, wouldn't it?" Oz said.</P>
<p>"Well, I'm taking a major in Criminology. And sophomore year they offer a course in Demonology. I should clean up."</P>
<p>"Which branch of criminology?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"The police kind."</P>
<p>"That's a good place to start." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Okay Mr. Sarcastic, what are you going to major in?"</P>
<p>"I'm undeclared."</P>
<p>"How'd I know that was coming?" Willow grinned.</P>
<p>They walked out of the admissions office, and turned in the schedule requests. When the people manning the lines asked what year they were going into and they said they were still seniors in high school, there were looks of amazement on their faces.</P>
<p>"Can we go look at the apartments now?" Buffy whined.</P>
<p>"What's your rush?" Willow responded.</P>
<p>"There's a lot of estrogen flowing between you two right now." Oz stated.</P>
<p>"The wolf thing?" Buffy asked, a blush creeping onto her face.</P>
<p>"I don't have to be a wolf to know that."</P>
<P>Buffy and Willow had one of their silent exchanges they were getting so good at.</P>
<p><I>'He's right, Will.'</P>
<p>'Well, it's your fault.'</P>
<p>'Hey you don't have to let me go on.'</P>
<p>'Why not? You're cute when you're flustered.' </I> </P>
<p>They broke the connection, and noticed that Oz had walked toward the direction of the shuttle bus to the apartments. They were both grinning as they ran to catch up with him.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The clerk finally brought out the oldest records dating back some hundred years. Wesley became quickly absorbed in the events the records revealed. Cordelia was looking into a hardback book that had pictures of previous town officials inside, and information.</P>
<p>She thought something was amiss. </P>
<p>"I may be wrong, but this doesn't seem right." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"What is it?" Wesley asked.</P>
<p>Xander was about to make one of his patented remarks, but as soon as he saw what she was looking at, his mouth hung open. There was a picture of the Mayor in 1898. His clothes were more rugged and appropriate for the time period and he had facial hair, but it was the Mayor.</P>
<p>"That's a grandfather, right? A really great, great grandfather?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>"I doubt it. According to this, Mayor Wilkins is over one-hundred years old, and most certainly not human."</P>
<p>"So that would explain why there aren't any other records of elections." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Quite. But other than knowing that the Mayor has been around for a good length of time this really doesn't tell us much about his plans."</P>
<p>"Sure it does. To stay in office forever all you have to do is be around when a town is founded and be immortal. Can you believe nobody's ever tried this kind of thing before?" Xander said.</P>
<p>"You may be on to something."</P>
<p>"He is?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"I am?"</P>
<p>"Well, obviously, the Mayor has needed to stay in power to not only maintain status in the community, have access, and privacy, but also to control the demonic population. He probably has connections that he has built up over the years to provide him with everything he needed.  He must have had to do extensive preparation."</P>
<p>"Well what could be so big that it would take a hundred years to get to?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"What does anyone in power eventually want?"</P>
<p>"More power." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Control and domination over not only the humans of the world, but the demons as well. Most likely whatever he has planned will make him stronger." Wesley said. </P>
<p>"Didn't 'more power' pretty much sum it up?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"You sure we'll be able to get an apartment together?" Buffy asked Willow.</P>
<p>"As long as we put in the request early enough."</P>
<p>"Not to mention the extra money to pay for the rent." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Extra money? It's times like this that I really wish they paid me to slay."</P>
<p>"Think about it. If you got just minimum wage for every demon you slayed…" Willow started</P>
<p>"Not to mention bonuses for world saveage…" Oz continued.</P>
<p>"I could've easily paid my way through college, not to mention supported myself for at least five years afterwards. Damn the Council."</P>
<p>"And the funny thing is, with the right spell, you could probably do that."</P>
<p>"Okay enough of this downer stuff, let's pick us out an apartment." Willow said.</P>
<p>Buffy smiled. "Yeah let's go."</P>
<p>"You two go ahead. I'm gonna go try and save what's left of Giles before he gets lost in the stacks." </P>
<p>"Knowing him, he's probably melded into the shelves." Buffy smirked.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"We've got lots of openings for your freshman year." Said the woman walking them through the halls. "There've been a lot of mysterious dropouts lately."</P>
<p>Buffy and Willow looked at each other. "Great." They muttered. </P>
<p>"There are still some students occupying apartments, so I can't show you all of them. Are you looking for separate rooms?"</P>
<p>"No, we were gonna share." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Well, good. It helps when two people split the cost." The woman looked at her watch. "There's a meeting today and I forgot all about it. Can I leave you two to fend for yourselves?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. Don't worry." Buffy said.</P>
<p>The woman handed her a key. "The rooms with no occupants are labeled. When you're finished, just return the key to the security guard downstairs. Hope to see you both next year!"</P>
<p>"Thanks!" They said.</P>
<p>They started to walk down the hall again. They came to a door labeled 'VACANT', and Willow turned the knob.</P>
<p>"Let's see what's behind door number one." Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They looked at five rooms, and in the final one, they all but collapsed onto the bed.</P>
<p>"So…which one do you want?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"They all kinda looked the same didn't they?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. I just think the reason they call them apartments instead of dorms is because each room has a bathroom."</P>
<p>"Group showering is kinda icky."</P>
<p>"Now two people is a different story." Buffy started kissing Willow's neck. "But this room does seem to have a bit more space than the others." She backed off.</P>
<p>"You're evil, you know that?" Willow rolled on top of Buffy. "Well, aren't you gonna kick me off?"</P>
<p>"Who said I wanted you to move? Seriously though, all innuendoes aside," Willow grinned at her, "I just like being close to you."</P>
<P> 	They crushed each other in a hug.</P>
<P>"Me too, and I don't wanna move, but we have to. To figure out how to save the world and stuff."</P>
<p>"I know. It's always something." Buffy sighed.</P>
<p>Willow kissed her, and they walked out of the room and locked the door.</P>
<p>"Library?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Library. Oh, and I wanted to see the computer lab before we left."</P>
<p>"Can I wait in the car while you do that?"</P>
<p>Willow swatted her. "We want 203, right?"</P>
<p>"Sounds good to me."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles and Oz were sitting at a table littered with books on the third level of the library when Buffy and Willow came walking in.</P>
<p>"Wow this place is huge." Willow said.</P>
<p>"You must be in heaven, Giles."</P>
<p>"It is certainly well stocked, unfortunately I don't have time to look around. Did you accomplish everything you wanted?"</P>
<p>"Yep. What do we know?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"More than we did." Oz said.</P>
<p>"In a volume called the Marenstacht Text it makes reference to the journal of man by the name of Desmond Kane. He was a pastor in a town called Sharpsville. The last entry said, 'Ascension in 3 days, God help us all.'" </P>
<p>"So what happened?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"The town disappeared off the map." Oz said.</P>
<p>"How…not great." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"In the same volume it has references to the Books of Ascension. I'm assuming the Mayor has the books safely locked away in his possession. Anyhow, the basics of the Ascension are a human transforming into a demon, the living embodiment of an immortal. However, there are thousands of possible species."</P>
<p>"And the ritual he uses to change depends on what he wants to become." Oz said.</P>
<p>"That's it, right?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>Giles shook his head.</P>
<p>"There's more?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Every person who wants to undergo Ascension or have attained it, have one thing in common. Up until the date of the transformation, the person is invulnerable."</P>
<p>All their faces suddenly frowned.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the Mayor's office Faith was sitting at his desk, her eyes closed. In front her was a small box. The Mayor was standing over her.</P>
<p>"Alright, you can open them up now."</P>
<P>Faith saw the gift and smiled at him.</P>
<P>"Fab. What's the occasion?"</P>
<P>"Faith! As if I need a reason to show you my affection. Or appreciation for running a small errand at the airport."</P>
<P>"Airport? What's next? Gonna want me to help a buddy of yours move a sofa?"</P>
<P>"This isn't a free ride, young lady. You know, I'm beginning to think that somebody's getting a little spoiled. Maybe I should take this back."</P>
<P>"Sorry... Sir."</P>
<P>"That's my girl. Now, a package is arriving tomorrow night from Central America. Something, and I can't stress this enough, something crucially important to my Ascension. Without it ... Well! What would Toll House cookies be without the chocolate chips? A pretty darn big disappointment, I can tell you. Open your present."</P>
<P>Faith opened it, and it was a very intricately designed knife with patterns on the blade. "There. That look on your face is my reward."</P>
<P>"This is a thing of beauty, boss."</P>
<P>"Well, it cost a pretty penny. So, you just take good care of it. And you be careful not to put somebody's eye out with that thing, until I tell you  to."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, at the library, the gang was comparing notes.</P>
<p>"Okay, the Mayor is at least a hundred years old, invincible, and will become something demonic on graduation day." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Pretty much sums it up." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Then may I suggest -" Wesley started.</P>
<p>"We need to do major surveillance on the Mayor. Everybody needs to be in on this." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Way to take charge." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Would you like to take over slaying? I could use a break." Buffy said to Willow.</P>
<p>"Nope. You can do that."</P>
<p>"Well, let's plan, people." Xander said. </P>
