<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty: Double The Blonde, Double The Fun -->

<p>***The Palace***</p>

<p>Brooke led Buffy into the house, both noting Faith's Harley in the
front drive.  Going straight up the stairs Brooke stopped in front of
Sam's door and listened.  Nothing.  Reaching under the small piece of
upraised carpet she produced a key.  Pushing the key into the lock
and opening the door the two blondes looked in on the two brunettes.
They were both sound asleep, curled up together in a tight embrace,
barely covered by the sheet.  Smiling Brooke relocked and closed the
door, and then led Buffy to her own room just a little further down
the hall.  Opening her door and then locking it, along with the
bathroom door she said, "well have to quiet so we don't wake them,
think you can handle that Herman?"</p>

<p>Buffy not missing the teasing challenge smiled and walked up to
Brooke, pinning her to the door, "I can if you can.babbling Brooke."
With out further ado Brooke brought her lips down on Buffy's in a
brutally smoldering kiss.  Pushing Buffy back to the bed Brooke
straddle her when they got there.  Buffy was all too happy to let
Brooke take the lead, for now.  Brooke was busy devouring Buffy's
mouth when she felt the hands on her back, under her shirt.  Pulling
back for all of two seconds Brooke pulled her shirt from her body,
and then crushed her lips back to Buffy's.</p>

<p>Impatiently Brooke pulled on Buffy's shirt, tugging it over her
head.  Getting up she tugged her skirt off, showing that she had
neglected to put her under garments on after her shower in the locker
room.  Then she pushed Buffy down and took the rest of her cloths off
for her.  Both of them being completely naked now, Brooke practically
pounced on Buffy.  Brooke's hips started thrusting against Buffy's,
their sexes rubbing against each other with every thrust.  Seconds,
or moments, or even hours later, they came with a grunt and a moan.
Brooke collapsed down on top of Buffy, exhausted.</p>

<p>Buffy rolled them over and started kissing and nipping Brooke's
neck, "my turn."</p>
