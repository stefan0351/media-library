<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty-Three: Caught In The Act -->

<p>***Park***</p>
<p>Lily and Josh were taking a walk. With everything going on lately
they felt as though they didn't get enough time together. So they
took the afternoon off and headed to the park. They were currently
walking along one of their favorite paths when Lily saw something she
just knew she wasn't seeing. Sam.with a girl. Sam with Faith.
Kissing. Groping. Hey this is a public place! Walking up to her
friend Lily cleared her voice loudly. When she got no response she
cleared her voice even more loudly. Nothing. Finally giving up (her
throat hurt now) she just settled for kicking Sam.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Sam squawked as she pushed Faith to the side to see who the
offending foot belonged to. "LILY!"</p>
<p>"You do realize you have a group of guys just standing there watching
right?" Lily asked, pointing to the guys in question, and smacking
Josh (his tongue was currently hanging out, and there was slobber,
not a good sight).</p>
<p>Sam and Faith both looked to where there was a rapidly thinning group
of ogling guys. Sam blushed and Faith just gave them a `shit-eating'
grin. Then Sam got all indignant (she's good at that) "Shouldn't you
be in school?"</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you?" Lily shot back. Sam had the grace to look
caught. "So, anything new in your life?" Lily asked with a raised
brow.</p>
<p>Sam and Faith finally stood up and Sam took Faith's hand defiantly
(or for comfort, either way) and stared her friend down, "Faith and I
are dating now.sorta, we haven't actually gone on a date, but you
know what I mean." Sam gave a quick nod of her head to emphasize her
statement, and Faith just grinned at her (she was cute when she was
all proud).</p>
<p>"So I see.how long?"</p>
<p>"Um.couple hours," Sam answered sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Wow, fast workers." Lily said and then smiled (Sam was her friend
and Faith, at the moment, was her hero, so she was happy for them).
Faith chuckled, and wrapped her arm around Sam's shoulders. Josh did
the same (why? Who knows.) and put his arm around Lily's
shoulders. "So." Lily stated awkwardly.</p>
<p>"You're not gonna out us are you?!" Sam asked suddenly, she and
Faith had just gotten together (gay or not) she wasn't ready to share
that with everyone yet.</p>
<p>"Not till you give the ok." Lily answered and then started pulling
Josh away, "see you guys later, and remember the park is a bad place
for groping."</p>
<p>"Bad personal experience?" Faith asked, speaking for the first
time. Lily turned bright red and Josh just gave Faith his own `shit-
eating' grin, which was returned.</p>
<p>"Can this day get any more eventful?!" Sam asked as she buried her
head in Faith's shoulders. And then she remembered that you just
never ask questions like that, OR IT WOULD HAPPEN! Giving a little
groan she buried her head further into Faith's flesh wishing she
could just stay there forever.</p>
