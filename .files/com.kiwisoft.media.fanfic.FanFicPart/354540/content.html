<p>"They make a good couple," stated Angel.</p>

<p>"Yeah, all right, but which couple are you talking about," Inquired
Cordelia pointing towards the two slayers and their girlfriends
walked from the dance floor towards the table.</p>

<p>Xander leaned back in his seat and wrapped an arm around Anya, "She's
got a good point, do you mean Buffy and Willow or Tara and Faith?"</p>

<p>"I was talking about Buffy and Willow, but Faith and Tara are good
for one another too."</p>

<p>"Nice of ya to approve of us oh brooding one," replied Faith as she
and Tara sat down across from Angel.</p>

<p>Tara gave Faith a playful punch on the shoulder, "That's not nice."</p>

<p>"Well when he starts to cheer up and isn't Mr. Doom and Gloom all the
time I'll stop," replied Faith.</p>

<p>"Good point, Faith," replied Buffy as her and Willow took their seats.</p>

<p>The next few hours seemed to fly by for the group as they talked
about old times, joked with one another, filled Cordelia and Angel in
on what had happened in Sunnydale since the two of them had left for
LA, and listened to the brooding vampire and ex-cheerleader tell of
their LA adventures.</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and took Willows hand, "Care for one last dance before
we head out on patrol?"</p>

<p>"Definitely," replied Willow.</p>

<p>Faith leaned over to Tara, "What ya say we join em?"</p>

<p>Before Tara could respond a mysterious cold breeze blew through the
bronze, sending Buffy and Faiths slayer senses into over drive.</p>

<p>Tara wrapped her arms around the brunette slayer who had began
trembling, "Faith, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"He's here." </p>

<p>"Who's here?"</p>

<p>"The Warlock," replied Faith recalling the coldness she had felt
during the other two encounters with the warlock.</p>

<p>"If he's here he's not alone," shouted Buffy as several vampires made
their way into the bronze.</p>

<p>The two slayers and Angel took up fighting positions in front of the
others as the vampires slowly began to make their way towards them.
The stopped about twenty feet from the group and stood there glaring
at the two slayer and their friends, the space in front of the vamps
began to waiver then emit a deep red glow, followed by a bright flash
that produced The Warlock.</p>

<p>Ciarán looked Buffy dead in the eyes, "Now I end this," snapped The
Warlock, motioning the vampires to attack.</p>

<p>Tara began chanting a protection spell for the groups as Willow
launched a rather large fireball towards the vampires only to have it
dissipated by The Warlock.</p>

<p>"It's not going to be that easy to win this time Mage," shouted The
Warlock.  He raised his hand into the air and shot a bolt of lighting
towards Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow quickly raised a magical shield around her beloved causing the
bolt to reflect back at The Warlock, sending him flying into the wall.</p>

<p>The vampires charged them, focusing primarily on Faith and Angel.
Buffy rushed over towards her fellow slayer and grabbed one of the
attacking vampires by the back of the collar and flung him across the
room.  She proceeded to grab another vamp by the chin and decapitated
him with her bare hands.</p>

<p>The Warlock stood up and launched a fireball towards Tara as she
continued her protection chant, Willow focused on the fireball as it
careened towards the blonde immortal and caused it to dissipate
seconds before it would have struck her.  She then turned her
attention back to The Warlock only to see a second fireball strike
the in the heart of the vampires who where attacking Angel.  She
stood there in horror as the vampires along with Angel where reduced
to ashes.</p>

<p>The Warlock then shot another fireball towards Faith and Buffy who
had just finished off the last of the vampires. He watched as the
fireball sailed through the air and struck an invisible barrier that
Willow had put between him and her friends.  </p>

<p>"Well done young Mage, unfortunately for you I have more than one
trick up my sleeve," replied the smirking Warlock as he vanished
before her eyes.</p>

<p>Cordelia knelt down and ran her hand through the ashes where Angel
had been fighting, tears started to stream down her cheeks as she
though of her friend and mentor and all that he had done for her.
She looked up at her friends who had formed a circle around her and
sobbed, "He's gone."</p>

<p>"And good riddance, there's nothing worse than evil gone good,"
snapped
Ciarán, reappearing next to Tara.  </p>

<p>The warlock reached out with his right arm and shot several bolts of
energy into Xander and Cordelia dropping both of them to the ground. </p>

<p>Ciarán looked at a stunned Willow, "It seems you have much to learn,"
he then turned towards Faith and looked her dead in the eye, "Since I
couldn't get you to leave I guess I'll just have to take something
you care about,"  Replied The Warlock as he grabbed Tara and vanished.</p>
