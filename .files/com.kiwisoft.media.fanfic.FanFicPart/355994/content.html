<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Nine -->

<p>It was dark when the sudden unpredicted storm began. They had a large flashlight as their light, turned upwards to spread the light in all directions. Cassidy was singing along with another one of her favorites from the Indigo Girls. The song was called "Burn All the Letters."</p>
		<p>Cassidy was drunk and on her feet, lifting her feet high and stomping them on the ground with the rhythm of the song, singing beautifully at the top of her lungs: "??burn all the letters, the government's on the phone. Burn all the letters, send them to a safer home?'" Andrea watched with a grin on her face, drunk too, but she didn't ask Cassidy to dance again. She was satisfied to just listen to her, to listen to the sultry voice once again come to the world with Cassidy's love of singing. She was satisfied to stare at the beautiful skin glistening with the flashlight's reflection on her sweaty skin; the shadow of Cassidy's throat and face made her seem like a moving statue of perfection.</p>
		<p>Cassidy had her face tilted to the sky, her eyes closed in seeming rapture, and her arms flung out in a seeming plea. Only trust would allow her to be so free in front of another person, and that was the basis of their friendship. Trust in one another. "??We made our love out of dignity, we dug our nails in the dirt? we loved so hard it hurt?To ease my pain I took a pen and paper?'"</p>
		<p>Cassidy and Andrea heard the distant but loud roll of thunder and simultaneously glanced up at the star-less sky, covered now with extremely dark clouds. They were shocked. The moon had been out, but was now completely gone. They had felt a slightly cool breeze, but didn't pay much mind to it. And they didn't pay any mind to the sudden stillness of the air around them afterwards. "You didn't call the rain with your singing, did you?" Andrea asked, attempting to joke in the midst of their new predicament.</p>
		<p>Cassidy giggled and shook her head, continued to stare at the reddening sky. "I didn't mean to." She returned.</p>
		<p>The rain started almost instantly, as they clumsily scrambled to pick up their stuff and get them into the car. It seemed the sky broke open, there was a sudden wall of rain between them. They were halfway to the car already, but when they reached it, they were soaked through with the rainwater. Andrea's tied hair fell heavily from its hold and was now wet and wild as she jumped into the passenger seat. Cassidy jumped into the driver's side and remained paralyzed, staring out the windshield. They were lucky she had pulled up the top on the convertible, so the seats hadn't been soaked with the rain; but they were soaking, and wet the seats anyway.</p>
		<p>Cassidy started the car, and turned on the windshield wipers, squinting through the windshield to see where she would go. Not drunk anymore, she turned on the high beams and shifted to drive; pressing the accelerator and moving slowly, she headed towards the road, which was barely visible through the thick wall of rain. Andrea was quiet beside her, looking out for things and lights from houses or cabins around, where they might be able to wait the storm out. The roads were slippery with rain and deserted, and it wasn't long before Cassidy's car began slipping and sliding along the road. After a few minutes of trying to keep the car under control on the road, Cassidy pulled up on the shoulder.</p>
		<p>She was pensively quiet for a long time, trying to peer through the now fogged up windows into the dark. An occasional lightning would eerily illuminate the giant trees looming over them. The wind whipped around the car with a vengeance, sending its cool lash into the car despite the heater. Cassidy began to sneeze continuously, she began to shiver uncontrollably, feeling chill after chill running through her body. Andrea was okay, she felt a little chill and shivered slightly. She noticed Cassidy's shivering and reached over to touch her shoulder.</p>
		<p>Cassidy pulled away from her, pressing against her door. She stared out the window at the dark, and said in quavering voice, attempting small talk: "They didn't say it was going to rain."</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed softly, and shook her head at Cassidy's reticence. "I know." She said calmly. She looked around at the darkness. Then she peered worriedly at Cassidy through the dimness and small dashboard light of the car. "Now we're in deep shit. You're going to catch cold here."</p>
		<p>"I'm okay." Cassidy said, and sneezed again. "I'm more worried about you. You're only wearing that little tank-top." She didn't want to look at Andrea, knowing what the sight of her engorged nipples through the soaked material would do to her. "We can't drive in this weather, there can be an accident."</p>
		<p>Andrea caught glimpse of something through the thick trees to the right side of them just as the lighting flashed. She squinted in that direction and waited until lightning flashed again. A cabin. Most likely deserted, but no doubt a better shelter than the car. "Look, Cassidy." She whispered, pointing in that direction. "There's a little cabin off that way. Do you think you could make it closer with the car?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy saw the cabin too, and waited for another flash of lightning to search for the road that led towards it. She shifted from parking to drive again and moved the car slowly towards the small road off the highway that led through the trees and to the cabin.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Andrea was right in her assumption.</p>
		<p>The cabin was completely deserted, but clean despite its isolation. It seemed that an occasional person stayed there and hung around. There was a lake not far from there, where they could fish and swim. No doubt a recreational resting-place, Andrea mused, most likely belonging to a businessperson that from time to time needed a place to stay and relax. Cassidy was able to pull the car up all the way to the porch, and Andrea jumped out with the comforter and flashlight in her arms. She ran up the three wooden steps and turned to wait for Cassidy.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was shivering uncontrollably, and she almost cried out when she felt the icy rain touch her skin and head again. She approached the door slowly and peered through the glass panes on the door. "Give me the flashlight, please." She said quietly, reaching back for it. She directed the beam inside and moved it over the objects. No one in there, if there had been, they surely would have noticed the beam of light from the flashlight. There was no furniture either, which was strange for such a well kept cabin.</p>
		<p>Cassidy stepped back from the door, and trained the beam of light on its frame, searching for maybe a secret holding place for a key or something. Andrea watched her, seeing the deep concentration on her features; she was stunningly beautiful. Cassidy reached up with her a shaky left hand and felt along the rim of the frame, where a small space was between the frame and the log walls. On the right side of the rim, Cassidy found what she was looking for; a key for the door. She smiled softly and glanced at Andrea with triumph in her eyes. She held up the key and grinned. "Got it." She said softly.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled back at her and watched as she slipped the key into the lock and the door gave way. They stepped into the nice cabin, which was unfurnished and dusty. There was no electricity, and no sign of there ever having been electricity. It was also cold, very cold. A deep, too loud rumbling sound came from everywhere and both Andrea and Cassidy jumped. The lightning that followed said it all. Just thunder. Huddling close together, both women walked the length of the living room and went into the kitchen, searching for any kind of light.</p>
		<p>They found a gas lamp on a wooden counter, and rejoiced.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Andy was naked under the down comforter, having been ordered by Cassidy to take them off so she could hang them to dry. Her wet hair was still loose, and far from drying. She wrapped herself tightly in the comforter, sat down on the floor next to the gas lamp. She sat in silence listening to the heavy downpour of rain pounding on the roof. Cassidy returned from the kitchen, she'd been hanging up the clothes from the counter. She now sat in front of her, shivering nearly uncontrollably. Her hair was very wet and dripping, loose around her shoulders and unkempt. She wrapped her arms around herself and rocked back and forth, her eyes closed. She sneezed again, and then coughed frighteningly hard. It was obvious to Andy that her teeth were clattering sharply.</p>
		<p>She knew Cassidy had to take off her clothes or she would be very sick. "Cassidy," She said softly, moving up closer to Cassidy and moving the lamp aside. Cassidy opened her eyes and gazed at her with glazed eyes. There was a faint line of perspiration on her forehead. Fever, Andy instantly knew. Without room for argument, Andy opened the comforter from around her body and pulled Cassidy into her embrace. At first, Cassidy was rock hard against her, but soon, she relented.</p>
		<p>Cassidy pressed her face against Andy's tenderly, only vaguely aware that Andy was naked against her. Her clothes, soaked and heavy, clung to her body like skin. She was trembling from the chill that invaded her body down to her bones. Andy's arms were around her, her face pressed against her feverish cheek; she could smell her cologne mixed with the scent of the rain, and it was driving her wild. Cassidy trembled once again, and felt her body heat up once again with the threatening fever. Andy pulled back to gaze at Cassidy, noticing the flush in her cheeks and another faint line of perspiration across her upper lip. She began unbuttoning Cassidy's shirt, she knew she needed to do this to keep her warm.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's lips were slightly parted, her breath was coming in short gasps of impending sickness. She took hold of Andy's hands, stopping their action to undress her. Andy gasped at the strength of Cassidy's shivering hands around hers. She stared at Cassidy, seeing the half-lidded gaze coming from her eyes. "I have to, Cassidy," Andy whispered. "I have to undress you, you're getting sick."</p>
		<p>Cassidy's hands softened and released Andy's. Slowly and cautiously, to not get that reaction again, Andy continued unbuttoning the shirt. As more tautly smooth skin was exposed, Andy became aware of a tingling in her body, a small electric-like charge running between her legs and an unnatural wetness growing between her lips. She took her eyes away from the flat muscled plane of Cassidy's stomach and the perfect round swell of her breasts to stare into her eyes. The golden hue of her eyes, accentuated by the lamplight, had intensified as Cassidy now gazed intently at her, her rosy tongue gently licking at her dried lips.</p>
		<p>Her eyes gazing into Cassidy's with growing awareness, Andy began unbuttoning the wet shorts. She was aware of Cassidy's smooth skin pressing against the back of her fingers. She lowered the zipper slowly, realizing that her breath was short and that her body was tingling like never before.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's hands came to life again, to remove her shirt and reveal the beautiful bronze skin of her upper torso. Her nipples were erect, Goosebumps pervaded the flawless flesh. Her gracefully long hands went to her shorts, she pulled them down and off. Andy's breath caught in her throat at the sight of the beautiful lines of Cassidy's hips, the sight of the thin fine hair between her tautly muscled thighs. She forced her eyes up, feeling a flame burn her from inside, following the rich planes of the smooth skin, the beautiful curves of her breasts, the glorious shape of her lips, and finally the heavenly gold-brown of her eyes.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's eyes were studious of Andy, gauging her reaction to her body. Despite her rising fever, she felt the passion race through her body and take possession of her mind as she sought to control it. "Andy," She whispered hoarsely. She lifted both her hands to touch the sweet softness of Andy's face. She pulled her close, and shuddered at the feeling of Andy's fingertips gliding across the taut flesh of her arms. With a deep in-drawn breath, she pulled Andy's face to hers to touch their lips together for the very first time in their lives. Andy's body jerked in response, a hot sliver of heat flashed through her body. Cassidy's lips were so silky against hers, so warm and tasting of the wine they'd consumed and the rain. Andy moaned, opening her mouth to feel the silky tongue touch hers in a moment's flash.</p>
		<p>And then it was gone, and Andy pushed her own tongue into Cassidy's silky mouth, trying to find the heavenly softness again. But Cassidy held back, though she never took her lips from Andy's. Andy lifted her hands from Cassidy's arms and moved to wrap her arms around Cassidy, but Cassidy took a hold of her hands and held them down. Andy groaned, fought against her hands as she tried to loosen her own to touch the flesh she knew would be so delicious to her fingers. Again, a flicker of her tongue against Andy's, and Andy felt her body would explode with heat; the wetness between her thighs, the flower of her pleasure engorged to the point of aching. She moaned softly.</p>
		<p>She never knew she wanted something so much in her life, and the realization that she wanted Cassidy so much sent a sliver of fear through her. But that didn't stop her desire, it only intensified, it only made it stronger and able to destroy the fear and thought and all else that came along with it.</p>
		<p>They were on their knees, by Cassidy's doing, bodies inches apart. Andy was powerless and weak with desire. Through her lustful haze, Andy knew that Cassidy was so much stronger than she was, and that anything she did to bring their bodies closer would only result in Cassidy overpowering her even more. But she <i>wanted</i> to be overpowered. She wasn't prepared when Cassidy pushed her hands backwards, pushed Andy down on the blanket, managing so that their bodies still didn't touch. She kneeled above her, this time pushing her tongue deep into her mouth, demanding from her what Andy knew she'd be willing to give.</p>
		<p>She didn't belong to herself any more, Andy realized as she felt Cassidy's thighs graze against her inner thighs, she belonged to Cassidy. Nothing else mattered but the feel of Cassidy's lips against hers and her tongue inside her mouth. She tried to free her arms, she wanted to grab Cassidy's body and yank her downwards to hers, but Cassidy tightened her grip and held her arms imprisoned, stretched out on either side of her.</p>
		<p>Cassidy possessed her, and Andy knew she was helpless and that she would ride the ecstasy only her kisses brought her. Cassidy pulled her lips away from her mouth to bring them to her body, and Andy's body was on fire, her blood was on fire. She moaned, feeling Cassidy's lips against her neck, kissing softly, and opening to allow the warm tongue access to the smooth skin. To Andy's joy, Cassidy finally lowered her body to press it against hers, and Andy was overwhelmed by silky sensation; she felt the sweat break out of her skin, felt the heat of Cassidy's body enter her, take a hold of her.</p>
		<p>She cried out in desperate desire, not able to extricate her hands from Cassidy's grasp. "Cassidy, oh!" She groaned heatedly, feeling Cassidy's lips moving in feathery caresses over her chest skin then towards her breasts. She was aware of nothing but Cassidy's round breasts pressing against her stomach, of her hips pressing between her thighs, the quick hot sensation of breath close to her nipple. She arched, pressing the heels of her feet against the back of Cassidy's muscular thighs.</p>
		<p>Cassidy entwined their fingers, held her hands secured against the floor. Her lips wound around a hard nipple, her teeth gently sinking and teasing. She sucked on the nipples until Andy was sore, until Andy's cries became louder and more passionate. Cassidy groaned audibly, feeling the swollen nipple press against her lapping tongue, the wetness press against her stomach; she tightened her grasp compulsively on Andy's hands, feeling her body tremble. She was quivering between her legs, wet beyond salvation, her passion for Andy unleashed. Nothing would stop her now. She felt the grip of Andy's hands beneath hers tighten, felt the short nails press against the back of her hands; she felt Andy's hips lift under her, the trembling heave of her stomach against her breasts as she gasped her arousal to the world.</p>
		<p>Cassidy wasn't thinking any more, she'd become the love she felt; her body was love, love that was giving itself to the woman who'd so innocently consumed her heart, whose pleasure was sending electric currents through her own body, which was love full of also. She pressed her hips into her, groaning fervently, feeling her wetness soak her skin. Her heart beat at a pace never matched before, her desire mingled with her love was driving her insane; her mouth was no longer gentle. She felt Andy arch beneath her as she moved lower down the center of her chest, kissing the sweaty flesh of her supple stomach lingeringly and wetly.</p>
		<p>She never thought this would happen, never imagined it would this wonderful. To make love to Andy was a dream come true.</p>
		<p>Andy was incandescent, flashes of fire danced before her eyes. And when she felt her hands mercifully released only to be replaced by the feeling of a strong arm moving beneath her buttocks to wrap around her waist, cradling her hips upwards. She moaned in anticipation of what she knew was to come; what she knew she needed.</p>
		<p>Cassidy lay sideways, her face pressed against the side of Andy's quivering abdomen, her right hand beginning a slow caress along the quivering inner thighs. She could smell the sweet scent of her desire, and wanted to taste it; but that had to wait, her sense of touch would be satisfied first. Her hand caressed lightly, moving closer towards the heat that was awaiting her. To wetness that was dripping, to throbbing that so desperately needed satisfaction.</p>
		<p>Andy cried out loudly, anticipating the satisfying touch that only Cassidy's smooth fingers could provide. Cassidy's breathing quickened, became low breathy moans as she felt the heat approach her fingers. With one swift move, she sank her fingers into the deliciously scented sea of Andy's desire. "Oh, God! So?" Cassidy gasped, feeling her own heat increase in temperature and wetness. "Wet! Oh, my God? So wonderful!"</p>
		<p>She closed her eyes against the rush of passion that ran through her head and body. And touched the soft engorged clitoris, stroked gently at the sensitive bud, gathered the wetness from beneath and spread it there to open it to caress between the silken sheets that covered the bud. She felt Andy's stomach heaving, quivering against her cheek. Andy sent a breathless cry to the ceiling, paralyzed now by the pleasure coursing through her body. She couldn't breathe, move, her throat constricted as passion took a fisted hold of her lungs.</p>
		<p>A breathless whisper: "Cassidy?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy felt her own wetness grow more, felt the fast beating of her heart between her legs. Andy thrust her hips quickly, overcome with love and passion for Cassidy; she couldn't think, all she could do was feel the electric currents of pleasure from Cassidy's caress. She wanted her inside, wanted the long graceful fingers to enter her and bring forth what she knew would be the most fantastic ecstatic orgasm. "Please!" She begged Cassidy with a throaty cry, grasping her shoulder with one hand and with the other, pulling the beautiful face tightly against her quivering stomach.</p>
		<p>Cassidy understood her plea very well, and wanted nothing more than to please her. Her other hand grasping the plush hip in her own frantic pleasure, she inserted one long finger into the flowing fountain, crying out as a lightning fast quiver shot through her own body from between her legs. Andy was pure sensation, the violent quivering the only response she could muster. She was enraptured with the finger that was curving upwards inside her, touching that quarter inch of sensitivity over and over again. She convulsed again and again, drawing deep audible breaths but being unable to release them in her orgasmic pleasure. She finally let out a breathless cry as Cassidy pulled out her finger, only to plunge it in again accompanied with another.</p>
		<p>Andy could feel the tears leaving her eyes and streaming down her temples, could feel the quivers inside herself as Cassidy was moving in and out of her, stroking that quarter inch of pleasure with each outward stroke. It was becoming unbearable, this pleasure, this orgasm that was building inside her to release in an incredible gush of ecstasy. She pulled at Cassidy's hair, trembling all over, crying out throatily over and over again. "Oh? oh? oh? Cassidy!" She arched.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's fingers increased their relentless demand, until Andy began quivering inside in ecstasy. She stopped their movement and held them very still inside her, concentrating on the strong clenching and unclenching of the flesh around her fingers. Andy gave a prolonged husky cry in her ecstatic oblivion, her hips thrusting high upwards against Cassidy's strong fingers inside her as she came over and over again. She was in a state of release for long minutes, coming again at the slightest movement of Cassidy's fingers inside her. A long while later, she lay in quiet lassitude, struggling to catch her breath.</p>
		<p>Cassidy lay with her head resting on her stomach, her fingers still cradled gently inside Andy. She was exhausted, and so was Andy, who lay with her legs open to her fingers, moving her hips languorously against them. She pulled at Cassidy's shoulders, wanting her to cover her body with her own, needing her comfort. Cassidy complied, lying above her and whispering tender kisses on the skin of her face and neck; she felt Andy's fingers trailing slowly along her long back, felt her legs wrap tightly around her waist. She trailed kisses all over her cheeks, over her closed eyelashes, over the smooth nose and then her velvety lips. Andy opened her mouth to her and Cassidy slipped her tongue inside, holding her head prisoner between her hands.</p>
		<p>Not long passed before both women were once again in full state of arousal, and were making love with more intensity. Neither spoke one word to the other, their bodies speaking all the language there was to speak. They made love again and again that night, accompanied by the soft love song of the rain.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They lay asleep in the comfort of each other's arms, their arms wrapped around each other's warmed bodies. The comforter was wrapped around their naked bodies, Andy lay on her side facing away from Cassidy, with her head resting against Cassidy's muscled arm. Her left arm cradling the arm, her hand stroking Cassidy's, she could feel Cassidy's nude body pressing up against hers from behind and molding to her.</p>
		<p>In her ecstatic stupor, she felt Cassidy bring her right arm over her waist to pull her even closer. Cassidy nuzzled the back of her neck with her soft face, smelling the delicious scent of her perfume, and sighing audibly as she lost consciousness.</p>
