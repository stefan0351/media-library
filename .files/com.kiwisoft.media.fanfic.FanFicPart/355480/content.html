<!-- The Better Life \ Chapter 5: I'll Keep Chasing The Soles Of Your Shoes -->

<p>When they walked back in Faith scaned the room for Gavin.  She found him
sitting on a couch still talking to the purple girl.  'Some sort of record
for him,' she thought as she walked over to him.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said standing in front of him.</p>
<p>"Hey," Gavin smiled looking up at her, "What's up?"</p>
<p>"You ok to drive babe?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I can drive, why?"  Gavin asked looking at the girl he was with.
"You two wanna motor?  Go down to the pier or something?"  Faith asked.
Gavin looked at Taz questioningly.</p>
<p>"Sound good to me." She stood up reaching for his hand; with a wide grin he
excepted her hand and let her pull him up.</p>
<p>"Cool, lemme grab my girl," Faith led the way over to where she had left
Buffy to wait.  "Ok, B, lets go."  She took Buffys hand and the four of them
left for the car.  Faith and Gavin each held open their doors letting Taz,
and Buffy climb in the back, getting in Faith turned to Buffy.</p>
<p>"We are gonna drive a little then probably end up at the pier, cool?"</p>
<p>"Yeah sure whatever," Buffy sat back, an excited smile on her lips.  Gavin
pulled out and roared up the dirt road and out onto a more main street,
finally back on the highway he speeded towards downtown Orlando.  Buffy had
never felt so happy in her entire life.  The radio was blaring, and both her
and Taz were laughing at Faith and Gavin dancing, and singing along with the
songs.</p>

<p align="center">~Hey, don't write yourself off yet<br>
It's only in your head you feel left out<br>
Or looked down on<br>
Just try your best, try everything you can<br>
And don't you worry what they tell themselves<br>
When you're away<br>
It just takes some time<br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride<br>
Everything everything will be just fine<br>
Everything everything will be alright, alright~</p>

<p>Faith reached back as she sang, squeezing Buffys knee, and then taking her
hand she pulled her forward a little, Buffy moved up so she was leaning over
the seat.  She smiled; thinking how beautiful Faith was singing and smiling
like this.  Faith surprised her by moving up and capturing her lips with her
own for s short soft kiss, Buffy smiled down and her and sat back in her
seat.</p>
<p>After cruising up and down International drive a few times, they made their
way out downtown towards a park (they bypassed the pier, because the author
just remembered that Orlando is not on the ocean, lol).  Parking they walked
to a gazebo.</p>
<p>"So Buffy, you're a senior?" Gavin asked.</p>
<p>"Yep," Buffy answered taking Faiths hand.</p>
<p>"And you don't go to our school?"  Faith asked Taz.</p>
<p>"Nah, I graduated last year, I am taking a couple classes at the community
college, but mainly I am just trying to earn some money, I met Xander a
couple years ago through some friends and we have been close ever since, so I
try to swing by his parties."</p>
<p>"Lucky me," Gavin said putting an arm around Taz's waist and pulling her
close to him.</p>
<p>"You better feel lucky," Taz purred in his ear, Gavin shivered a little, and
Taz stuck out her tongue barely licking his ear.</p>
<p>"All right, so, we're gonna go swing, or something," Gavin said, Faith
laughed as he pulled Taz away toward the swing set.</p>
<p>"He always picks that kinda girl, it's too bad they always hurt him," she
shook her head.</p>
<p>"She seems nice," Buffy commented, sitting down on a bench, Faith followed
suit.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well I hope.  So, wow this is kinda weird."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Honestly?  Meeting a girl at a party, and liking her, not like just for sex,
can't think the last time that happened."  Faith turned smiling at Buffy.</p>
<p>"Well, most of those girls, I wouldn't want you to like them."</p>
<p>"Why not?"  Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Cause I like you to like me," Buffy moved up against Faith turning her head
to kiss her, she ran a hand through her hair, resting it on her neck,
breaking off the kiss, she pulled back a little licking her lips.  "I like
you to kiss me."</p>
<p>"Glad we have something in common then," Faith said leaning in to kiss her
again, she pulled Buffy over so she was strattling her lap, Buffy leaned down
hungrily kissing her, Faith was caught totally off guard when she pulled back
suddenly and jumped off her lap.</p>
<p>"Oh my God, what time is it?"  Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"What?"  Faith looked at her confused.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" Buffy asked again slower.  Faith looked at her watch.
"I dunno, almost midnight," Buffy grabbed Faiths wrist looking at her watch,
the exact time was eleven fifty-eight.</p>
<p>"I gotta go," Buffy started backing away towards the road.</p>
<p>"What? Oh you got curfew? No problem, I'll just got get Gavin," Faith turned
to walk towards the swings.</p>
<p>"No, I have to leave now," Buffy turned jogging away.</p>
<p>"Buffy, wait," Faith grabbed her. "Gavin give you a ride, just wait one sec."
 Buffy nodded, but took off running as soon as Faith had gotten far enough
away; she was across the Park by the time Faith noticed.</p>
<p>"Shit," Faith took off after her.  Buffy ran quickly, and was soon leaving
Faith behind, she felt in her pocket, glad to find the change from the
carbide still there.  Almost to the main road she stumbled falling, losing
one of her sneakers, she was about to grab for it when she noticed she had
tripped over her pants, which were once again way too long for her.  She
could hear Faith coming, so she quickly scrambled into the bushes hiding.</p>
<p>"Buffy, fuck dude," Faith stopped at the road looking both ways, but seeing
no sign of her.  "Damn it."  Faith started back towards the car when she
noticed the shoe, she picked it up and carried it with her, recognizing it as
Buffys.</p>
<p>After Faith disappeared Buffy came out of the bushes and jogged down the road
quickly till she came to a gas station, there she stopped and called a cab.
She road home quietly praying that she would get home before the rest of her
family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith ran back to the car and threw the shoe inside, then jogged over to the
swing set.  Gavin and Taz were sitting talking quietly.</p>
<p>"Hey, um, hate to interrupt, but I just lost my date," Faith said sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Try to move a little to fast for her tiger?"  Gavin teased.  Faith gave him
the finger.</p>
<p>"No, she just got all freaked out about the time and then ran off, she lost a
shoe, I got it."  Gavin laughed.</p>
<p>"Not funny, what the fuck I find a girl I like, and I immediately loose her?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, come on lets go, we'll drive around and see if we can find her."  The
three walked back to the car.  The drove through downtown a few times, then
decided to give up.  They dropped Taz off at one of her friends' house, then
headed back towards Faiths.</p>
<p>"I gotta find her Gavin."</p>
<p>"You really like her don't you?"  Gavin asked astounded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I really do."</p>
<p>"Then we'll find her."</p>
<p>"How?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know, she goes to our school, we have her shoe, can't be that hard,
we'll make all the hot blonde girls who are seniors try on the shoe."</p>
<p>"That shoe could fit anyone."</p>
<p>"No, that is a Nike Glass, those shoes are custom fitted to one person."</p>
<p>Faith and Gavin rode the rest of the way in silence, Faith contemplating if
she would ever see Buffy again, and eager for school and Monday and the
chance to find out.</p>
