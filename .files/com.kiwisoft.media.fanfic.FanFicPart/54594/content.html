<P>Alex tried to sit on the sofa and relax, but
  the scent of Kathryn was already imbedded inside her nostrils which led her
  to close her eyes and try to recapture the moment of kissing the young teacher.
  She decided she wanted to be near her. She couldn't stand it any more so she
  got up and went to the kitchen.</P>
<P>Kathryn was leaning over the sink wiping the
  coffee mugs that had been previously hanging from an overhead rack. She hadn't
  used them in quite a while and decided they might be a little dusty. </P>
<P>A pair of hands slowly wrapped around the smaller
  woman's waist. Kathryn could feel her heart start to pound as she slowly breathed
  in. She felt a shudder of electricity run through her entire body. She moaned
  as she turned her head to face the taller woman. Her lips were captured as her
  heart was conquered.</P>
<P>Alex could feel the flat muscularity of Kathryn's
  stomach, she slowly moved her hands just below Kathryn's breast which got her
  a deep moaning sound of desire. Her heart was ablaze as she needed to feel the
  fiery lips of the woman before her.</P>
<P>The kiss between the two deepened and it took
  all of Kathryn's composure to pull away first. "I...um" she swallowed "I want
  you..." Kathryn spoke in between breaths.</P>
<P>"What?" Alex breathed "Anything just tell me"
  I can't take this anymore... I want her, God I need her.</P>
<P>"Make love to me Alex." Kathryn clearly stated.
  </P>
<P>Alex swallowed the biggest lump in her throat.
  She suddenly felt scared, she wanted this woman so badly, she wasn't sure if
  she could take it without her heart exploding into a million pieces.</P>
<P>In one swoop Alex lifted the lighter woman.
  "Where's your bed?" </P>
<P>Kathryn leaned her head into Alex's neck and
  began to feast. She moaned and pointed with her chin and eyes guiding Alex to
  the bedroom. </P>
<P>Alex Lay her down on the bed and took off her
  shirt, she didn't do it slowly just about ripped the buttons open. Kathryn was
  gazing up at the dark-haired woman. Oh she's beautiful.</P>
<P>She started to unbutton her own shirt but Alex
  stopped her. "No, let me...please"</P>
<P>it wasn't a question but a statement of what
  Alex was going to do. She grabbed hold of both of Kathryn's hands and interlocked
  each with her own as she climbed up on top of the smaller woman. Her knee went
  just in between Kathryn's legs rubbing against her womanly essence. </P>
<P>Kathryn let out a cry. "Ohh!" Her hands were
  held down by Alex so she raised her head offering her lips to the heavenly body
  that hovered above her. </P>
<P>Alex leaned down and received the offering,
  she let go of Kathryn's hands and using one hand to hold her up let the other
  one cup the back of Kathryn's head as she pulled her in.</P>
<P>Every so slowly... Alex moved her hand down
  to Kathryn's blouse. One by one she released the buttons, until the blouse lay
  open. Lucky for her Kathryn had a front opening bra. In awe of what was about
  to happen she paused and admired the woman she craved. With a wry grin noticed
  what her next move would be... Alex smiled as she released the clasp. "Hmm"
  she moaned as she was given passage to view the soft mounds of rounded pink
  flesh. "Ohhh" she sighed as her lips moved toward the left nipple first. Her
  tongue licked at it.</P>
<P>Kathryn felt her body give ... she jerked up
  as her nipple felt the wet heated tongue. "Oh God" she cried.</P>
<P>This brought a smile to Alex's face. She leaned
  in this time she pulled the nipple into her mouth and began to suckle..."Ayy."
  Kathryn let out. </P>
<P>Alex pulled away briefly to unbutton Kathryn's
  pants. She pulled them off in a swooping motion. Leaving the teacher in a pair
  of black laced underwear that matched her bra. Alex looked down and raised an
  eyebrow in approval. Her fingers ran along the top of Kathryn's panties causing
  a chill of excitement to run through her whole body. Slowly she pulled at the
  garment until it was off and flying to the floor. </P>
<P>"Take off your pants." Kathryn ordered as she
  sat up and pulled the unbuttoned shirt off Alex's back.</P>
<P>Alex stood up and removed her bra, she heard
  Kathryn slur in a breath. Then she leaned down and pulled off the rest of her
  clothing leaving her completely naked.</P>
<P>Kathryn looked on in pure admiration of the
  exquisite woman that stood before her. "You are sooo beautiful."</P>
<P>"So are you." Alex spoke as her eyes devoured
  the woman laying on the bed, "So Are you." She whispered then in a leonine movement
  crawled up the smaller woman to meet awaiting lips.</P>
<P>Finally skin on skin. Kathryn felt Alex's breast
  as they rubbed against her own. Her hands embraced the taller woman holding
  her head to guide their kiss, then moving down her back and kneading the soft
  skin before grabbing a handful of Alex's rear.</P>
<P>Alex surged forward "uhh!" she let out as she
  felt Kathryn's hand on her ass. </P>
<P>She pressed her thigh between Kathryn's legs
  to spread them apart. </P>
<P>"Oh Alex!" Kathryn let out. She pulled Alex's
  rear toward her. They both began to grind their bodies in unison until Kathryn
  felt Alex's hand move down toward her triangle of golden curls. "Alex....please..."
  she cried. </P>
<P>Alex stroked gently with her palm and fingers,
  allowing her middle finger to glide along the slit of the labia majora. </P>
<P>Kathryn was panting in desperation "A-L-E-X...I...I...need...you...inside"
  </P>
<P>Alex rubbed the tip of her middle finger allowing
  Kathryn's wetness to lubricate it before she glided it into Kathryn's needed
  center. </P>
<P>"Oh yes..." Kathryn sucked in.</P>
<P>Alex moved another finger in and began manipulating
  her wrist with a quickened pace. At the same time her mouth feasted on one nipple
  then the other.</P>
<P>Kathryn raised her leg slightly allowing her
  knee to make contact with Alex's own desire. "Oh God...Kath...hmm" Alex lifted
  her head briefly to let out plea, but her mouth was captured as Kathryn grabbed
  Alex's face and brought her lips down for a searing kiss. "Hmm" was all that
  was heard. </P>
<P>The desire that had built up inside Kathryn
  was finding release as she wrapped her legs around Alex's pelvis. Alex's fingers
  deepened with each movement until she could feel the pulsating center. "oooohhhh
  my god Alllllleeeeexxx. Kathryn let out a long panting plea. Suddenly she felt
  Kathryn's body go completely limp. "aaahh." </P>
<P>Alex turned to lay on her back and Kathryn scooted
  on top. Her finger circled around Alex's nipple which caused a shiver to run
  throughout her body. "Hey, that tickles." Alex laughed grabbing Kathryn's hand
  and pulling it toward her lips for a long kiss.</P>
<P>"Hmm." Kathryn smiled. "You are so beautiful
  Alex." </P>
<P>"You know, the first time I saw you, I felt
  someth... I wished I was the one going to school." Alex spoke softly.</P>
<P>Kathryn leaned over and pressed her lips against
  Alex's, again feeling a warmth grow between her legs. She could feel Alex's
  growing response. This time it was Kathryn's hand that danced it's way down
  to a darkened triangle of silky locks.</P>
<P>"Ohhh, Kath..." Alex moaned as her hips pushed
  up to me Kathryn's hand. She stroked gently moving her hand all around the excited
  area. </P>
<P>"Your like fire." Kathryn spoke between kisses.
  Her tongue flicked at Alex's nipples, then she kissed down toward her stomach.
  Slowly moving her body lower to kiss ever part of Alex.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, please... I need to feel you..." </P>
<P>"Hmmm,you will... I promise..." Kathryn moaned
  the words as she kissed the inside of Alex's thigh.</P>
<P>Alex put her hands on top of Kathryn's head
  and guided her the rest of the way to where she was needed most. "Ohhh...Yessssss"
  she hissed. </P>
<P>Kathryn was delighted at the scent and taste
  of Alex. Her head was spinning. </P>
<P>She could feel the desperation in the movements
  Alex made. She could almost feel the orgasm Alex was about to release. Her tongue
  thrust in harder and faster until she moved her fingers in place. </P>
<P>Alex's head was thrown back as her legs started
  to shake. She suddenly froze as the wave of excitement pasted through her body
  leaving her to quiver. She grabbed hold of Kathryn. She knew this woman was
  the one....God I'm in love with her.</P>
<P>Kathryn looked into Alex's eyes and saw her
  own reflection, her own desires, wants, and needs. "Where have you been all
  my life?" She whispered. </P>
<P>"Just looking for you." Alex replied as she
  pull Kathryn in for a kiss that ignited another round of passion.</P>
<P>Their love making continued until the wee hours
  of the morning before both fell into an exhausted slumber.</P>

<hr>

<P>Sunlight cracked through the partially opened
  blinds hitting Alex's eyelids. Slowly she opened her eyes and for a brief moment
  didn't recognize her surroundings. Her body felt heavy, she had something on
  top of her or rather someone. The memories of the previous night came back to
  her instantaneously as she heard the young teacher slightly stir. </P>
<P>Kathryn was wrapped around and on top of Alex,
  she held to her like a giant teddy bear.</P>
<P>The responsibilities of motherhood suddenly
  took over and Alex had to get up to call her mom and check on Sam. She leaned
  over and kissed Kathryn's head. "I'll be right back baby." She whispered into
  the sleeping woman's ear. </P>
<P>"Hmm, no, don't go." Kathryn moaned with her
  eyes still closed. </P>
<P>"I'm not going anywhere, I'm gonna call Sam."
  </P>
<P>"K, but hurry back."</P>
<P>Alex suddenly had a feeling of worry. She picked
  up the phone and dialed her mother's. She had never spent the night out without
  her mom knowing where she was. Thoughts of terrible things happening came to
  her head. I hope Sam's all right, I hope nothing happened. Shit, I shouldn't
  spent the night, what if mom had to get in contact with me.</P>
<P>"Hello?" Cyrene answered the phone with the
  sound of sleep in her voice. </P>
<P>"Hi mom it's me."</P>
<P>"Alex, is everything all right? What happened!"
  Cyrene suddenly filled with worry.</P>
<P>"Nothing, I just called to check on Sam, is
  she OK?" </P>
<P>"Jesus, Alex it's six in the morning."</P>
<P>'I'm," Shit, "I'm sorry mom, I didn't know it
  was this early." Alex suddenly feeling a bit foolish.</P>
<P>"Alex, where are you?" Her mother suddenly realized
  Alex wasn't home. </P>
<P>"Why do you ask that?" Alex's voice was a bit
  higher. </P>
<P>Cyrene knew that tone so well, it was a tone
  Alex used whenever she was hiding something.</P>
<P>"I lost track of time and fell asleep at a friend's
  house, then I realized I didn't let you know where I was. I just got worried
  about Sam that's all." Alex suddenly felt like she was defending her actions.
  </P>
<P>"Oh, you lost track of time huh? Cyrene spoke
  sarcastically. "I remember that one very well. Sooo, it sounds like the shoe
  is on the other foot." Cyrene smiled into the phone remembering a time when
  Alex would be out all hours of the night and come in the next morning to a hysterical
  mother and casually say she lost track of time.</P>
<P>"tch, Alex everything is fine, Sam's sound asleep
  and I wouldn't have even know you weren't home."</P>
<P>"OK, sorry for waking you so early."</P>
<P>"Don't worry honey, when Sam's eighteen, well
  ... if she's anything like you..." Cyrene laughed into the phone, which made
  Alex laugh. </P>
<P>"All right mom."</P>
<P>"Go back to bed Alex, I'm sure your friend is
  waiting for you." </P>
<P>"MOTHER!" Alex's eyes widened with shock. </P>
<P>"Oh come on Alex your a grown woman now, you
  don't have to hide anything from me."</P>
<P>"I know, but well, we never talked about this
  stuff." Alex whined into the phone. She didn't want to talk to her mother about
  her sex life. It was bad enough when Alex was in college her mother had to console
  quite a few heartbroken lovers Alex left hanging. Her mother always thought
  it would be her son's girlfriends she'd empathize with not her daughter's, but
  just the same she stood by Alex.</P>
<P>"Is she the one you visited last Wednesday?"
  Curiosity getting the better of Cyrene.</P>
<P>"How did you know that?" Alex sounded puzzled.
  </P>
<P>"Well, gee I couldn't help but see that goofy
  grin you had on your face when you came in." Cyrene laughed wholeheartedly.
  </P>
<P>"Yea, she's the same one."</P>
<P>"really, how'd you two meet?"</P>
<P>"OK, Mom, I'm not gonna give you all the details
  right now, you need to go back to bed, I'll talk to you tonight when you bring
  Sam home." Alex sounded frustrated, the last thing she wanted right now was
  to talk to her mother about Kathryn.</P>
<P>"OK, OK, I'll see you later."</P>
<P>"Bye mom." Alex hung up the phone and headed
  toward the bathroom. </P>
<P>Kathryn heard Alex run the bathroom sink water,
  she stirred a little in bed but didn't want to get up, it was Saturday morning
  and she wanted to sleep in. She was hoping to sway Alex into staying a while
  longer. </P>
<P>Alex walked into the bedroom and saw Kathryn
  hiding her head under the covers. "Hey sleepy head don't you want to get up?"
  </P>
<P>"No." a muffled sound came through the blanket.
  </P>
<P>"So, um whatcha want to do then?" Alex said
  grinning. </P>
<P>"Why don't you come in here and find out." The
  muffled voice replied. </P>
<P>Alex took off the shirt she put on when she
  got up to make the phone call. She could feel her body already reacting to Kathryn's
  seductive muffles. She lifted the cover and slide into the bed immediately wrapping
  her body around the smaller woman.</P>
<P>"Hmm." Kathryn groaned as she felt the heated
  body suddenly embrace her. "I was hoping to stay in bed till noon." </P>
<P>"Noon." I haven't slept till noon since I was
  a teenager. Alex laughed out. </P>
<P>"Who said anything about sleeping." Kathryn
  stated as she threw the blanket off their heads and went in for a searing kiss.
  </P>
<P>Both women embraced and once again started the
  love making ritual with more passion and fire than the previous night. </P>

<hr>

<P>The weekend flew by so quickly. Kathryn spent
  Sunday with her dad Jake since he canceled his dinner with her on Friday night.
  But for all that mattered, she was off somewhere in another place. He knew something
  was up, she had a grin that attached itself like a magnet to metal. Every time
  he looked at her it was there.</P>
<P>"Honey, so um what'ja end up doing on Friday
  night?" </P>
<P>Kathryn began to blush, "Well, I went to dinner
  with a um par...I mean a friend of mine." I won't call her that again. Kathryn
  thought as she remembered how much it bothered Alex. Alex, gosh I wonder what
  she's doing right now, God I miss her.</P>
<P>"You musta had a reeaal good time with this
  friend of yours..." </P>
<P>Kathryn was smiling. "Yea."</P>
<P>"So what's he look like?"</P>
<P>Kathryn pictured herself floating high above
  the clouds ... suddenly she started to plunge down to earth... falling...falling...boom!"
  </P>
<P>"Ah, what...?" Kathryn snapped back to reality.
  Oh shit how am I going to tell him.</P>
<P>"Honey, are you all right, you look a little
  pale?" Her dad got up from his chair and kneeled down next to Kathryn's seat.
  </P>
<P>"What is it? You can tell me anything, I'm your
  father, Kathryn, tell me..." </P>
<P>Kathryn swallowed intensely, she had never told
  him or her mother. Maybe because she never had anyone she wanted to talk about...until
  now. </P>
<P>"Well, dad, sheee's very beautiful, I met heeer
  at school." Kathryn couldn't look her father in the eyes. She looked at her
  sweater and played with an imaginary piece of lint.</P>
<P>It took a few minutes for it to register, "She?"
  her father repeated. </P>
<P>Kathryn slowly looked up at her dad, her eyes
  had a hint of tears. Her heart was racing and her stomach felt like it wanted
  to discard the food that had recently been sent to it.</P>
<P>My daughter's gay? look at her, she's a beautiful
  woman, how can she be gay? It hit him like a bullet to the heart she was twelve
  years old and she was crying because her teacher was getting married. He knew
  she loved her and he felt sad that he couldn't help his daughter. He leaned
  over and gave her a hug that only fathers can give their daughters. Kathryn
  broke down in tears only daddy could comfort.</P>
<P>"I love you honey."</P>
<P>"I love you too dad." Kathryn whispered into
  her father's chest. </P>
<P>The pair broke from the embrace and her father
  wiped at Kathryn's tear streaked face. "Well, what does she look like." </P>
<P>A sudden glow came to Kathryn's face as she
  began her tale of how she met Alex.</P>

<hr>

<p>Alex had been thinking about Kathryn all day, she wanted desperately to call
  her but knew she was at her dad's house. She kept busy with Sam until it was
  her little girl's bedtime.</P>
<P>"Ring, ring...ring, ring."</P>
<P>Just as Alex finished telling Sam a story and
  tucking her in, she heard the phone.</P>
<P>She was slapped in the face with a big smile.
  "Hello." </P>
<P>"Hi, are you busy?" Kathryn asked. She had just
  walked in the door and couldn't wait to call Alex.</P>
<P>"Hi, no...I was hoping you'd call." Alex lifted
  her head and mouthed the words thank you. "So what did you do today?" </P>
<P>"I told my dad about you." Kathryn spoke seductively.
  </P>
<P>"Hmm, really what did you tell him?" Alex picked
  up the tone and copied it. </P>
<P>"Well, I told him I had a thing for tall...Kathryn
  swallowed...beautiful...blue eyed women with long silky black hair." </P>
<P>"What are you...doing right...now..." Alex asked
  as her breath increased. </P>
<P>"I was hoping you'd invite me over for some
  coffee?" Kathryn spoke hesitantly.</P>
<P>"Um ... that sounds like a good idea."</P>
<P>About ten minutes after Alex gave Kathryn the
  address to the house she heard a car drive up. Alex opened the door and watched
  as Kathryn got out of a black jeep.</P>
<P>"Hey." Kathryn said as she walked up the sidewalk
  to the front door. </P>
<P>Alex held the door for Kathryn. Once they both
  were inside Alex shut the door and nudged Kathryn up against the wall. She put
  her hands on Kathryn's shoulders and leaned in to kiss the smaller woman. It
  was like she had been under water all day. She desperately needed oxygen and
  Kathryn's lips, her mouth were the only things that could supply her with air.
  "I uh...thought about you..." Alex panted "all day..."</P>
<P>Kathryn knew what Alex was feeling because she
  couldn't get Alex out of her head either. "Where's Sam?"</P>
<P>"She's asleep in her room." Alex answered before
  going in for another kiss. </P>
<P>'Hmm, so why don't you show me your room." </P>
<P>Alex smiled and grabbed Kathryn's hand. "It's
  this way." She said as she lead her younger companion to her bedroom. "Shhhh
  we have to be very quiet though."</P>
<P>"OK, I'll try." Kathryn whispered.</P>
<P>Alex could feel Kathryn's hand massaging her
  own. She turned into her bedroom and sat on the bed. Then she pulled Kathryn
  up to her allowing for her hands to wrap around Kathryn's waist. </P>
<P>Kathryn leaned down and rubbed her cheek across
  Alex's forehead. "Hmm, Alex."</P>
<P>She moaned. "I can't seem to get you off my
  mind. What am I gonna do?" </P>
<P>Alex smiled, her hands moved down to rub Kathryn's
  rear. Her fingers moved in between the back of her thighs until Alex was able
  to lift Kathryn on top of her.</P>
<P>Kathryn's legs wrapped around Alex's. "I want
  you to make love to me." She said before capturing the taller woman's lips.
  </P>
<P>"mommy"</P>
<P>Alex had her eyes closed as she kissed the woman
  who sat on top of her. </P>
<P>"mommy"</P>
<P>Alex slowly came back from the dreamlike state
  she was in as she heard Sam's voice.</P>
<P>Kathryn turned her head to the sound of Sam's
  voice, she quickly got off of Alex's lap.</P>
<P>Alex got up and went to Sam's bedroom. Kathryn
  could hear the muffled sounds of mother and child. A few minutes later Alex
  returned to her room. </P>
<P>"Is she all right?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yea, she just wanted a drink of water."
  </P>
<P>Kathryn's heart beat began to slow down. "What
  are we gonna do?" She asked. </P>
<P>"I don't know, you think we should slow down
  a bit?" Alex spoke with a hint of worry on her face.</P>
<P>"Alex, I've never felt this strongly about anyone
  before. I don't want to mess things up. But I'm..." Kathryn paused. </P>
<P>"Are you afraid Sam might say something at school."
  Alex spoke after seeing the concerned look on Kathryn's face.</P>
<P>"What...no, it's not Sam...I don't know if...it's
  you...I don't know if I can keep my hands off you for a minute."</P>
<P>Alex let out a long breath. "You had me scared
  for a minute there." Alex began to laugh. "Well, we're gonna have to try." </P>
<P>Kathryn grabbed for Alex's hand. "Yea I know,
  come on walk me out." </P>
<P>Alex pulled Kathryn in for a kiss and both found
  themselves panting at the release.</P>
<P>"Alex please...don't get me started."</P>
<P>"OK...OK..." Alex swallowed as she lead Kathryn
  to the front door. "How am I supposed to go to sleep?"</P>
<P>"Ugh, sleep, you really think I'm gonna get
  some?" Kathryn replied. She stretched her neck up and planted a kiss on Alex's
  cheek. "Goodnight my sweet." Then she turned and opened the door leaving Alex
  standing behind watching as she got in her jeep and drove off. </P>
