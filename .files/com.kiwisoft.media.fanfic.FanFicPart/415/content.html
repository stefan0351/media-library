<!-- Another Turbolift Another Drama \ null -->

<p>Torres groaned as she regained consciousness. What the hell had gone wrong this time?</p>
	<p>"Lt are you damaged?" she heard a familiar voice and remembered that she was in a turbo lift with Seven.</p>
	<p>She had to cough several times before she found her voice. "I don´t think so. Any idea what happened?" She tried to sit up gingerly but pain lanced through her head so she thought better of it.</p>
	<p>Seven covered the short distance that separated them in an instant. "You are damaged", she stated and ran her fingers through the back of Torres´ head until she found a sizeable lump. Torres hissed as she examined it.</p>
	<p>"It´s just a bump Seven, I´ll be OK", but she used the opportunity of Seven´s closeness to clamber up into a sitting position.</p>
	<p>Seven was reluctant to increase the distance between them though she felt uncomfortable at the intimacy of their positions. She looked at Torres who was leaning into her for support apparently unaware of the affect she was having on the young ex-drone. Seven could feel her own pulse quicken and her temperature rise as she relished the sensation of the Chief Engineer´s toned, compact body nestling into her for support.</p>
	<p>Seven had to swallow repeatedly before she could continue communicating. "The turbo lift has malfunctioned Lt. We have fallen approximately ten decks before the safeties activated but the sudden deceleration caused you to fall and strike your head. The turbo lift seems to be jammed between decks and there is no power to move it. I have informed the Captain of our predicament and was informed that an engineering team is working to solve the problem but they estimate us to be static for at least two hours."</p>
	<p>"You gonna draw breath at some point?" Torres asked.</p>
	<p>"I take it you are being facetious Lt. I was merely informing you of our current status". Seven bristled exactly as Torres knew she would.</p>
	<p>"Calm down Seven, I was just trying to lighten the mood ? I just hate the feeling of helplessness". Seven noticed that the half-Klingon was still quite drowsy.</p>
	<p>"Are you sure you are functioning correctly Lt?"</p>
	<p>"I just have a headache, that´s all", Torres mumbled as she slumped into unconsciousness in Seven´s arms.</p>
	<p>Seven felt alarm course through her body. "You are not the only one feeling helpless, B´Elanna", she muttered angrily as she gently laid Torres onto the floor. Torres was definitely injured far more seriously than they had both first suspected but Seven had no means of finding out the extent of her injuries and even if she did, she had no way to help her.</p>
	<p>She clenched her hands in frustration and paced what was left of the free space in the turbo lift. She slapped her comm. Badge. "Seven of Nine to the Bridge. Lt Torres has lost consciousness again. She requires immediate medical treatment. Emergency site to site transport to sickbay is needed."</p>
	<p>She heard the frustration and concern in Janeway´s voice as she responded. "I wish I could Seven but we are working on emergency power here only. All transporters are off line. We know the situation, Seven. You just have to be patient. We´ll get to you as quickly as we can".</p>
	<p>"I understand Captain. Please hurry". Janeway´s eyebrows shot up in surprise as she heard Seven.</p>
	<p>"We´re working on it Seven. Janeway out".</p>
	<p>Realising that she was still pacing and that it wasn´t helping, Seven of Nine found a corner of the turbo lift and sat down in it, hugging her knees in tight. From her position, she stared at her recumbent companion and examined her features closely, something she had done furtively for many months now. She sighed loudly. She could never tell Lt Torres of her feelings ? the Chief Engineer had already made her feelings abundantly clear. Her throat tightened but she did nothing to stop the flow of tears fall.</p>
	<p>Torres woke for a second time on the turbo lift floor. The sharp pain in her head had been replaced with an annoying buzzing. She shook her head to try and clear it. "Big mistake, Torres" she muttered to herself as the room span again. A stifled sniff caught her attention and she looked up into the tear-ravaged face of Seven of Nine.</p>
	<p>"Kahless, Seven what´s up?" She pulled herself across the floor to reach her, knowing that standing would be another big mistake.</p>
	<p>As soon as she spoke she saw the ex-drone place a mask of neutrality on her face. "I, er? there is nothing wrong B´Elanna, I seem to have developed a malfunction and am leaking".</p>
	<p>"Cut the bullshit Seven, what´s going on?" The words were harsh and B´Elanna laid her hand on top of Seven´s Borg enhanced one to soften the impact. Seven withdrew as if a leaking EPS conduit had burnt her. Torres frowned but remained where she was, looking enquiringly at Seven.</p>
	<p>It seemed like eons but after a few agonising moments Seven drew breath and calmed herself. The Lt already hated her. By declaring her love it would make no difference to her attitude. If anything, she would avoid her, which would be less painful than spending time with her, knowing her love was unrequited.</p>
	<p>Seven looked at Lt Torres directly and let her emotions and feelings pour out in just four words.</p>
	<p>"I love you, B´Elanna".</p>
	<p>Torres stared at Seven whilst trying to comprehend the mass of emotions sweeping through her. She slumped into the turbo lift wall and shut her eyes.</p>
	<p>This was not the reaction Seven had been expecting. Anger or rejection maybe. She had even retained a glimmer of hope that B´Elanna would return the words but to do nothing?</p>
	<p>"I have embarrassed you, Lt. I will not bring up the subject again. Rest assured that this will not affect our working relation.."</p>
	<p>"Shut up Seven" Torres said softly. The tall blonde looked at Torres, confused at the conflict of words and tone.</p>
	<p>"I´ve been such an idiot", Torres said almost to herself. She looked deeply into Seven´s eyes appreciating for the first time how beautiful they truly were. She gently raised her hand and traced the outline of Seven´s face, brushing her fingertips gently over the ocular implant.</p>
	<p>Her touch felt like electricity to Seven as desire ran through her body. Deep inside she was throbbing with excitement as she allowed B´Elanna to continue her examination, leaning into the touch until their faces were barely apart.</p>
	<p>B´Elanna revelled in the scent of her soon to be lover. She paused tantalisingly before closing the final distance between their lips and kissed Seven gently, undemandingly. Seven could feel her temperature rising and felt like she was losing all sense of reason. The only thing she wanted to do was get as close to B´Elanna as possible. Instinctively her hands snaked round B´Elanna´s head, fingers stroking the smooth soft hair whilst pressing her lips further into the half Klingon. She licked B´Elanna´s lips with her tongue, felt her open her mouth and deepened the kiss passionately. B´Elanna´s hands were running up and down the back of Seven in exploration but were drawn to the firm breasts. She brushed her fingertips over the nipples feeling them react through the skin tight material and hearing Seven moan with desire. B´Elanna smiled and drew back, breaking away from the kiss much to Seven´s disbelief.</p>
	<p>"Lt have I done something wrong?"</p>
	<p>"It´s Lanna, and no, you´ve done everything right so far", she smiled wolfishly. "However, this is your first time right?" Seven frowned.</p>
	<p>"You mean the first time I have copulated? Yes."</p>
	<p>"We´re gonna have to work on that vocabulary Seven. This is the first time you´re making love, my darling. I want our first time to be unhurried in the privacy of our bedroom where I can love you all night without fear of interruption" B´Elanna smiled wickedly. "Besides, I have a headache".</p>
	<p>Seven sat up concerned. "Lt I mean Lanna, are your injuries worsening?"</p>
	<p>"I don´t think so darling, I just want the Doctor to sort me out so that there are no distractions tonight."</p>
	<p>"Tonight?"</p>
	<p>"Yes, dinner at mine for 20:00 Hours. And bring your toothbrush". The comment brought a beatific smile from Seven but any comment she was about to make was interrupted by the comm. Link.</p>
	<p>"Captain to Seven of Nine, the transporters are back on line. Prepare for transport."</p>
	<p>The two women were smiling at each other as the transporter beam plucked them from the turbo lift.</p>
