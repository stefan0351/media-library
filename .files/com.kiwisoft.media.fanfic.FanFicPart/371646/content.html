<P>"I can't actually believe he's leaving," Miley said as she slumped into her chair. Me and Oliver walked past and sat on my desk, me with my feet on my chair as we faced her.</p>
<P>"I know, right? I mean he's only a teacher but...it'll be weird."</p>
<P>Oliver nodded, "Yeah." He always had some wonderful input into our conversations.</p>
<P>Miley sighed and leant back, "You do Oliver's little video thing?"</p>
<P>I nodded. I remembered that day very well. I had written down what I wanted to say and learnt it...then forgot every word. I don't think Oliver's ever yelled at me more.</p>
<P>"Oh, <I>boy</I> did she," Oliver added, rolling his eyes, causing Miley to laugh a little. She always laughed with her eyes, that's when you could tell if she was really feeling what she seemed to be. Her eyes. They gave everything away. And lately, they never mirrored what she tried to portray. They were always trying to scream something else out to me, something that I couldn't figure out.</p>
<P>"Morning class," Mr Corelli said in his usual, dorky way as he strode past us. "Oliver, Lilly get of the desk," he added, not turning around.</p>
<P>I think he was used to telling us that, kinda like a routine. I'd always be sat on my desk talking to Miley, and nine out of ten times, Oliver would be right there with me.</p>
<P>Oliver and I laughed, when we usually would've sighed, and proceeded to take our seats. Oliver, however, headed for the front of the class and the TV that was in the corner.</p>
<P>He began wheeling it over, "Actually, sir. There's something that we want to show you."</p>
<P>Mr Corelli stood up a little straighter now, and some guys from the front row took him to a chair in the class. All of us in the room had been interviewed to wish him luck and stuff, and Oliver had put it together into a final goodbye.</p>
<P>I guess he got a better offer from another school. I mean, who wouldn't take the better money, right?</p>
<P>"If this is a last minute prank I <I>will</I> still give you detention," he sounded a little worried, which made many people in the classroom laugh a little. I even think Amber and Ashley will be sad to see him go.</p>
<P>He was just different from the other teachers, he stood out. Sometimes, granted, it was for the wrong reasons, but we all have our flaws.</p>
<P>Oliver placed the disk in the DVD player and pushed it in.</p>
<P>He smiled as he headed back to his seat, having pressed the play button.</p>
<P><I>'I can't!'</I> I looked on at the screen, it was Miley sat next to Oliver.</p>
<P>I saw Oliver turn around, wide eyed and look to Miley, who at that moment seemed to realise too.</p>
<P>I looked between them both wondering what was going on and why I wasn't in on it. If they <I>were</I> going to prank him before he left I wanted in!</p>
<P><I>'You can, she'll be fine with it, Miles.'</I></p>
<P>I looked back to the screen, a little confused. I assumed it was me. Yes, a little self absorbed maybe, but when your two best friends are talking and refer to a she, yet you know nothing about it, I think it's fair to guess.</p>
<P><I>'She won't be fine with it.'</I></p>
<P><I>'How do you know.'</I></p>
<P><I>'Because she just won't.'</I></p>
<P>I saw Oliver fiddling with the remote frantically, but in light of the now darkened room it wasn't even bright enough to find the desired button. I became even more intrigued now.</p>
<P>Everyone's eyes were on the TV, some of them probably as confused as me.</p>
<P><I>'Just talk to her, Miles.'</I></p>
<P><I>'Oh yeah. Hey Lilly I'm like, so in love with you that it's pretty pathetic, and I'm telling you this because I like to look like a goof!'</I></p>
<P><I>'You'd word it differently, obviously.'</I></p>
<P>With my eyes slightly widened, I looked over to Oliver. I felt stiff.</p>
<P>From the words 'Lilly, I'm like, so in love with you' I had zoned out. I heard everything else that was said, but I took none of it in.</p>
<P>He released the remote, having finally managed to press the correct button, and dropped his head.</p>
<P>I very slowly, in the now silent classroom, turned to look back at Miley. Her eyes were wide and threatened with tears, her mouth was trembling a little, but remained agape.</p>
<P>I opened my mouth to speak, but I honestly was lost for words. What do you say after seeing something like that?</p>
<P>Everyone's eyes burned in on us.</p>
<P>Miley moved her vision away from me and noticed the lingering eyes. She quickly rose from her chair, pushing it back violently, and stormed out of the classroom.</p>
<P>"Miley!" I shouted, turning back to Mr Corelli as if to ask him for permission to leave.</p>
<P>He nodded, signalling his approval.</p>
<P>I smiled quickly to thank him, then headed for the door.</p>
<P>She must've moved fast, because looking up and down the hallway there was no sign of her.</p>
<P>"Miley?" I shouted as I headed up the long hallway, not caring who heard or who was bothered by my yelling. I just wanted to get to my friend and comfort her, tell her it was alright.</p>
<P>"Miley?" I asked for the final time, sighing. I had been calling her name for a while now, scaling the hallways of our huge school.</p>
<P>I finally came to a door. It was the door to the girls bathroom. And either that door had a bad day or there was someone crying from the other side of it.</p>
<P>Miley was my first thought.</p>
<P>I quickly opened the door, and just as I expected, she was sat, hugging her legs and leaning against the wall.</p>
<P>She heard the door open, I could tell by the way she buried her face further, but she didn't dare to look up.</p>
<P>"Miles..." I moved slowly over to her, burying my hands into my pockets, "You alright."</p>
<P>"Yeah...every thing's great," she mumbled.</p>
<P>"As sarcastic as ever," I laughed a little, a sympathetic smile on my face.</p>
<P>"You don't have to pretend to care," she said, raising her head from her arms now. She had been crying...a lot. I was never good with these kind of situations. Dealing with someone crying was not my strong point.</p>
<P>"I do care, Miles," I offered as I knelt beside her, "I'm your best friend."</p>
<P>She let out a breath, placing her head back against the wall, "Best friends..."</p>
<P>I sighed and nodded, seeing her glance down to see my reaction, "Yes Miles. No matter what. Even this, OK, I still love you, just like I did before."</p>
<P>"Even knowing that I want more than that?"</p>
<P>I closed my eyes for a moment. It was still strange to hear her say that. To say that she loves me more than I thought she ever would, this kind of love from her was something that I never contemplated.</p>
<P>"Yes, Miles," I moved my hand to wipe away her tears, "Nothings gonna' change, OK?"</p>
<P>She seemed to think for a moment, which was making me increasingly nervous. She finally nodded, a hint of a smile making it's way onto her face. I could see the hint of disappointment, though.</p>
<P>With a large, relieved smile I pulled her into a hug, "You don't have to worry about telling me things like this," I said, still tight in the hug. I felt her nod into my shoulder, still crying slightly.</p>
<P>She slowly moved back, "What about everyone?"</p>
<P>"What about 'em?" I said, confidently. I was trying to get some of it to rub off on her. A fragile Miley was a very rare sight. "I'll be right there if you need me."</p>
<P>I smiled warmly, causing it to mirror on her face.</p>
<P>I pushed myself up by my knees, and offered my hand. She stared at it, before reaching out and taking hold. I pulled her up and smiled as I met her gaze.</p>
<P>I moved her hair around a little, straightening it out, and removed the dry tears from her face. Once I was satisfied we agreed to head out together, back to class.</p>
<P>It wouldn't be that tough, right?</p>
<P><B>A/N: I plan this to be short, about 5 chapters.<BR>And hopefully quickly updated.<BR>So yeah, random story, and please review.<p>Thanks for reading :)</B></p>
