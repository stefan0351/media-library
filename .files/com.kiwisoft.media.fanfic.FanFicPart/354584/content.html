<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 12 -->

<p>That night after the gang left the Bronze there seemed to be a black cloud
looming over each of the scoobies, all but Faith and Buffy. Tara had gone
back to her dorm room, already wishing she didn't have to leave her new
friend. Oz had sensed Willow's uneasiness around Veruca, and he spent the
night trying to convince her that she had nothing to worry about, though he
wasn't so sure that it was entirely true. He knew he loved Willow, but there
was still some force larger than himself pulling him to Veruca. Anya even
spent the night trying to bring Xander out of his bad mood by trying to
convince him that not all of the gang was turning gay since she liked
interlocking with him too much for that.</p>

<p>Missy and Cordelia were the only two who made the most of the night by
trying not to feel any sort of sadness. Sure, neither were happy about
having to part right after finding each other, but to look at them no one
would ever know. Buffy and Faith offered to stay at Joyce's again, so the
two of them could have the dorm room to themselves. The night was spent
mostly with Missy watching reruns on the small tv in their room, while
Cordelia lie on her bed next to her, completely engrossed in the magazine
she was reading.  It would've seemed stupid to any other person, for the two
to spend their night hardly paying attention to each other, but it felt
right to both of them.</p>

<p>They weren't in love, and didn't know if they ever would be so there was no
need for over emotional goodbyes and promises that they weren't sure they
could keep. This is what seemed natural to them, almost as if they had sat
around just like this every previous night of their lives. They felt
comfortable around one another, and that was a rare thing for Cordelia.</p>

<p>"You know your face is going to get stuck like that don't you?" Cordelia
asked with a smirk as she looked up at Missy who was staring at the tv
wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Funny, my mom always told me that too. But it only seemed to affect Cliff
since I've still got the perfect face."</p>

<p>"Perfect?" Cordy questioned with a look of disbelief, but then smiled at
Missy to let her know she agreed with the statement.</p>

<p>"So what happens when you leave tomorrow?" Missy questioned as Cordelia put
her magazine on the nightstand next to the bed. Cordelia shrugged as she
moved into Missy's arms.</p>

<p>"I really like you and all, but maybe we should just be friends until we
know each other better. If we meet someone else, we can date them. If we
decide we really wanna be more than friends then we'll figure something
out."</p>

<p>Missy tensed a little bit at that, already jealous of whoever would get to
be with Cordelia besides her, but it was the most reasonable thing she could
think of. They didn't know each other well enough to try a long distance
relationship yet, but maybe one day. Cordelia could feel Missy tense at that
and she kissed her in reassurance. "You'll probably find someone else before
I do," she whispered, and Missy could hear a trace of sadness in her voice.</p>

<p>Missy didn't respond to that, already not liking the direction that the
conversation was going to. She turned off the tv and turned off the lamp
that was by her bed. They laid in each other's arms in the dark for the rest
of the night, both too afraid that if they slept the morning would come too
soon. Sometimes they'd talk and tell stories of their past, some funny, some
sad. They'd make sarcastic, sometimes snide remarks to each other and found
a common bond upon realizing that they could each take it as well as they
could dish it out. In a way it was their own way of showing affection for
each other. It wasn't the most conventional way to go about showing someone
you care for them but it worked for those two.</p>

<p>Sometimes they'd kiss and touch each other for a while before breaking back
off into their comfortable silence. They both wanted to claim the other's
body as their own that night, but both refrained knowing the timing wasn't
right and that it would only make things more complicated when Cordy had to
leave in the morning.</p>

<p>So instead they stayed as they were, ignoring the future, spending every
second enjoying the present. Only time would tell what would happen with
them, but they just met and there was still no need to rush anything. If it
were meant to be, they would end up together in the end after all.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning Oz woke up to find his girlfriend muttering in her sleep
and he smiled as he looked down at her. "Mmm, it's in the sandblaster. Uh,"
Willow said in her sleep.</p>

<p>"What's in the sandblaster Will? It's a dream. Come back to me," Oz said as
he tried to wake her up.</p>

<p>"Willow's smile grew a little.  "Mmm hmmm… All Gemini's to the raspberry
hats," she said, still acting like she was asleep.</p>

<p>"Now you're faking," Oz smiled down at her.</p>

<p>"Am not. Just a little," Willow told him in a cute voice as she turned to
face him.</p>

<p>"Morning."</p>

<p>"Morning," the red head replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Bad dream?" Oz questioned, concerned for her.</p>

<p>"I guess, but the waking up part makes up for it." Willow gave him a kiss
and smiled at him.</p>

<p>"It's always so busy in there," he commented as he held his girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Not always. Some things shut it up completely," Willow told him as she
cuddled even closer to him.</p>

<p>"Anything I can help you with?"</p>

<p>"We gotta go say goodbye to Cordy and Tara now." Willow sighed as she
climbed out of her boyfriend's bed reluctantly. "Are you gonna come?" Oz
nodded silently, suddenly feeling untalkative.</p>

<hr>

<p>The whole gang was now gathered around Cordy's car waiting to see her off.
Everyone was giving their hugs and well wishes, and even Xander hugged her,
however awkwardly. Tara was standing around the group watching them all,
hoping that she wouldn't be gone in LA very long so she could get to know
them together. After a while Xander, Anya and Oz excused themselves. Oz was
the only one with a feasible excuse to leave. He had practice with the
Dingoes early, since when night come he'd be getting a little too hairy.</p>

<p>"Don't let Queen C intimidate you too much," Faith advised Tara while Buffy
said bye to Cordelia. "She likes to pretend she's a bitch but she's nice.
And she's all bark and no bite anyways, unless you ask," Faith said with a
wink.</p>

<p>Tara turned about ten shades redder and opened her mouth, trying to form
words but found it impossible. Willow noticed and walked over to the two,
shooing Faith away with a gentle push. Willow could have sworn she heard
Faith growl playfully at her but she turned her attention to Tara.</p>

<p>"So you're leaving huh?" Willow asked sadly. Tara nodded, feeling the
saddest to leave Willow behind. Not only did she want to stay around and
practice spells with the red head more, but after seeing the way her
boyfriend was eying the singer of Shy, she didn't want to leave her. "You're
coming back aren't you?" Willow questioned sadly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll be back as soon as this whole thing is done. Keep practicing
those spells I told you about too," Tara said with a smile.</p>

<p>Willow nodded, and gave the blonde a hug. "As weird as it is for me to say
this, take Faith's advice and don't let Cordy get to you. She can be mean,
and trust me I know, but under all the layers she's a sweet person."</p>

<p>Just then the two of them noticed Cordelia and Missy walking away from the
group to say their goodbyes. Buffy and Faith took their leave saying they
had to go get the house cleaned up before Joyce got home, and Willow and
Tara kept talking so as to allow the other two their privacy.</p>

<p>"I'm really not the type for emotional goodbye's," Cordelia started as she
took on of Missy's hands in her own. "But I'll miss you."</p>

<p>"I'll miss you too." Missy smiled at her. "So do I get a goodbye kiss or
what?"</p>

<p>Cordelia's eyes went wide and she looked around her. "In public?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>"It's not like you live here anymore," Missy laughed.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you do," Cordelia replied, but Missy knew Cordy didn't really
care about that. She just liked to be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>"I do, and I don't care. I want a kiss," Missy said stubbornly causing
Cordelia to laugh. Before Cordelia could say anything else though she felt
Missy's lips pressed softly against hers and she wrapped her arms around
Missy's waist pulling her closer. When the kiss broke they continued the
embrace for a few minutes before Cordy pulled away.</p>

<p>"I've gotta get going now," she informed Missy.</p>

<p>Missy nodded, and gave Cordelia a quick peck on the lips. "Call me when you
get there so I know you got back okay. And be nice to Tara, she's the
sensitive type you know."</p>

<p>"I promise to call, and I'll be as nice as I can be to her. She could use a
little toughening up anyways."</p>

<p>The two walked back towards Cordelia's car and hugged one last time before
Cordy got in. Willow and Tara also exchanged one last hug, and as soon as
Tara was in the car Cordelia drove off, leaving two sad girls behind. "Well
this sucks," Missy said to Willow. The red head only nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Just as they turned around to walk back to campus, Missy spotted an all too
familiar face. "What the hell was that?" the blonde girl yelled at Missy
with wide eyes.</p>

<p>Missy's smile came back, and she grinned from ear to ear. She took hold of
Willow's hand and led her over to the girl. "Long time no see Torr."</p>
