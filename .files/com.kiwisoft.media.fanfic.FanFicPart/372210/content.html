<p><i>- </i>Ty Herndon, "Living In A Moment"</p>
<p>The morning dawned clear and bright, almost as though the world itself was reflecting the happiness found by the two young women still sound asleep in each other's arms. Whether it was because they were both still tired, or because they simply weren't ready to let each other go just yet, neither of them so much as moved, a pair of angelic smiles still lighting up their sleeping faces. Finally though, after lying silently together through what remained of the night and most of the morning, their peaceful rest was interrupted by the unlikeliest of sounds: a loudly growling stomach.</p>
<p>"Sounds like someone's hungry," Miley whispered sleepily, her smile widening.</p>
<p>"Just ignore it," Lilly replied, her own voice thick with sleep. "Maybe it'll go away."</p>
<p>"Lilly," Miley whispered again, giggling. "I know you're awake." When her best friend didn't respond, she carefully raised her head and gently kissed the side of Lilly's neck. Again there was no response, so Miley proceeded to kiss her way slowly and teasingly up Lilly's exposed neck, finally nipping at her ear lobe. Lilly hissed in pleasure.</p>
<p>"You don't play fair," she managed.</p>
<p>"What can I say, you bring out the worst in me," Miley said playfully. "Now open your eyes."</p>
<p>"Do I have to?" Lilly grumbled.</p>
<p>"You never know, you might like what you see," Miley quipped. Her own grin widening, Lilly finally did as she was asked, breathing in at the sight of the beautiful auburn-haired angel still lying in her arms.</p>
<p>"You're right, I <i>definitely</i> like what I see," Lilly said warmly. "Can I wake up like this every morning?"</p>
<p>"I'd say yes, but I wouldn't want to give daddy or Jackson a heart attack," Miley chuckled. "Have I told you lately how much I love you, Lilly Bear?"</p>
<p>"I think you did last night," Lilly said with a wink. "Several times." Miley blushed but managed to laugh again.</p>
<p>"I didn't hear you complaining, Miss Truscott," she retorted, smiling as she ran her hand along Lilly's bare body beneath the sheets. Lilly gasped lightly, squirming at the intimate touch.</p>
<p>"My mother didn't raise any stupid children," she quipped. "You were wonderful last night, Miley; <i>beyond </i>wonderful."</p>
<p>"So were you, Lilly," Miley replied softly. "I've never felt like that with anyone, ever... and I don't ever want to with anyone else."</p>
<p>"Like you've got a choice," Lilly whispered, her eyes twinkling mischievously. "First thing tomorrow, you're getting a 'Property of Lilly' tattoo right <i>here</i>." She slid her own hand under the covers and gripped Miley's bottom possessively. Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"Better make that matching tattoos," she said seductively. "You're mine, Lillian Danielle Truscott, and I'm never letting you go."</p>
<p>"Right back at you, Miley Ray Stewart," Lilly replied, grinning as well. "Now, can you think of one good reason for me not to stay in this bed and make love to you again?" Miley felt her entire body instantly grow warm.</p>
<p>"As long as I get the same privileges," she said in a throaty whisper. Lilly responded by pulling the woman she loved to her for another passionate kiss, and soon everything else faded away but their love for each other, and their desire to share it in the most intimate way possible.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Much later, Miley and Lilly finally made themselves get up and get dressed and checked out of the hotel. They stopped at a nearby Denny's for breakfast and eventually made their way back to Miley's house. It was nearly eleven o'clock by then, and Robbie Ray Stewart was outside tending to his daily chores. As they walked up to the house hand in hand, neither girl could quite the hide the matching grins they wore.</p>
<p>"Hey girls," Robbie Ray greeted them as he rode up on his tractor. "How was the Prom? Have a good time?"</p>
<p>"It was the best Prom ever, Mr. S," Lilly said enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Miley agreed, "and I got to dance with the most beautiful girl in the world." Lilly blushed politely.</p>
<p>"Stop that," she said with a giggle. Smiling, Miley leaned in and whispered something in Lilly's ear; her cheeks immediately went from pale pink to bright red.</p>
<p>"Miley!" she hissed, still giggling but trying not to die from embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Oh, please," Miley whispered teasingly, her smile widening. "You weren't complaining before, Truscott!"</p>
<p>"Never," Lilly whispered back, "but Miley, your <i>dad</i> is sitting right over there!" Miley winked.</p>
<p>"What he don't know what hurt him… or us," she said saucily.</p>
<p>"Do I even wanna know?" Robbie Ray asked lightly. The looks passing between his daughter and her girlfriend had not escaped his notice; neither had their tell-tale joyous grins. He could remember wearing such a grin himself, a long time ago… but despite what he suspected, there were some things he just didn't need to know his little girl was doing.</p>
<p>"Don't worry daddy, we're just playin' around," Miley replied, smiling innocently.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Robbie Ray quipped. "Whatever you say, bud."</p>
<p>"I think we're just gonna go to my room and relax for a little bit, okay daddy?" Miley asked him, trying to ignore the knowing expression on her father's face.</p>
<p>"Sure thing, bud; I'll be back in a bit to fix some lunch." He looked back over his shoulder as his daughter and her girlfriend hurried into the house. "Try to behave yourselves!" he called out. Lilly stopped immediately, her cheeks turning red.</p>
<p>"Uh… Miles… you don't think your dad, uh… knows, does he?" she managed. Miley thought about it for a moment.</p>
<p>"Maybe," she said hesitantly. "To be honest, I'm trying not to think about it!"</p>
<p>"Guess we better, uh… be careful then, huh?" Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>"That's no fun," Miley replied with a wink.</p>
<p>"Just wait, Stewart," Lilly replied, her voice soft and husky. "As soon as I get you alone again, you're gonna have all the 'fun' you can stand."</p>
<p>"Is that a promise?" Miley asked teasingly. Lilly grinned and pulled her best friend to her, kissing her softly.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Sometime later, Miley and Lilly lay together on Miley's bed, wrapped in each other's arms, just enjoying each other's company. Miley reached up and gently began to run a hand through Lilly's long blonde hair.</p>
<p>"That feels nice," Lilly purred happily. Miley smiled.</p>
<p>"You know, whenever I'm with you Lilly… I feel like the luckiest girl in the world," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>"I feel the same way, Miles," Lilly whispered back. "I never thought I could be this happy."</p>
<p>"Who'd have thought one little note could lead to so much, huh?" Miley said softly, still smiling. Lilly grinned at the thought.</p>
<p>"Who knows, Miles… maybe we were meant to be." Miley could think of no more appropriate answer than to lean forward and kiss the woman she loved gently on the lips. The kiss quickly grew hungry and passionate, as the two young women let their love and desire for each other overtake them for several long, wonderful moments. Finally though, oxygen became a pressing need, and they were forced to part; they remained wrapped in each other's arms though.</p>
<p>"You've always been there for me, Lilly," Miley said softly. "Whenever I needed you the most, you've always been right by my side." Lilly smiled again.</p>
<p>"Isn't that what best friends do?" she replied, and Miley squeezed her tightly.</p>
<p>"Do you remember when we had our very first sleepover?" she asked aloud. Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"Like it was yesterday…"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>NINE YEARS AGO…</p>
<p>"<i>Thanks for inviting me over, Smiley," nine year old Lilly Truscott said happily as she walked into her best friend's bedroom, a 'Powerpuff Girls' duffel bag slung over one should.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Thanks for coming, Silly!" Miley greeted her excitedly. "Just put your stuff anywhere." Lilly did so, dropping her bag on the ground nearby, then she sat down on Miley's bed beside her best friend.</i></p>
<p>"<i>So what do you want to do tonight?" Lilly asked her.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Well… do you like movies?" Miley replied, trying to keep her voice steady. Though she did her best to hide it, she was actually very nervous; she had never before had a friend stay the night at her house, and was determined to make a good impression.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Sure," Lilly said with a grin. "Nothin' scary though!"</i></p>
<p>"<i>Don't worry, I don't have anything scary," Miley said with a grin. She got up and walked over to the shelf that held her small DVD collection, returning a moment later with a few selections.</i></p>
<p>"<i>This one," Lilly said, quickly making her decision. Miley smiled.</i></p>
<p>"Lady and the Tramp<i>, huh?" she remarked, her grin widening.</i></p>
<p>"<i>It's cute," Lilly retorted, defending her choice. "Besides, you're the one who owns it!"</i></p>
<p>"<i>I know," Miley laughed. "I've always kinda wished I could have a dog like Lady." She blushed a little, and Lilly instantly felt bad.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Yeah, me too," she admitted. "Tell you what, Miles…how about you go get us some popcorn and I'll get the movie ready?" Miley smiled, her heart swelling, and nodded.</i></p>
<p>"<i>You got it, Lils… I'll be right back!"</i></p>
<p>"<i>Aww…" Lilly gushed, watching as Lady and the Tramp unknowingly kissed over a plate of spaghetti. She looked over at Miley and noticed the way her best friend was smiling happily, her eyes focused intently on the screen, a kind of joyous expression on her face. Something in her expression made Lilly's skip a beat, but the blonde tomboy didn't quite understand why. As far as she was concerned, she simply liked seeing her best friend so happy. At that moment, Miley happened to notice Lilly's sudden attention.</i></p>
<p>"<i>What?" she asked with a shy smile.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Nothing," Lilly responded, smiling in return. "You just looked really happy is all."</i></p>
<p>"<i>I guess I was," Miley told her. She stuck out her tongue. "Now stop trying to embarrass me!" Lilly giggled.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Sorry, Miles… gimme some more popcorn and I'll be quiet!" The mischievous look on Lilly's face made Miley laugh out loud. Reaching into the popcorn bowl between her and Lilly, Miley grabbed a handful and tossed it at Lilly. Lilly shrieked in surprise.</i></p>
<p>"<i>All right, now you're gonna get it, Stewart!" she exclaimed. She grabbed another handful of popcorn and hurled it at her best friend, who laughed and tried to shield herself with a nearby pillow.</i></p>
<p>"<i>No fair!" Lilly shouted, still laughing. "Come out and take your lumps!" When Miley made no move to do so, Lilly playfully tackled her and startled tickling her.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Give up yet, or are you thirsty for more?" Lilly taunted, grinning widely as Miley shrieked and squirmed beneath her.</i></p>
<p>"<i>O-okay!" Miley managed, howling with laughter. "You g-got me, Lilly! S-stop!" Smiling, Lilly finally relented. The brief tickle fight had worn her out though, and she collapsed wearily beside Miley.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Great sleepover," Lilly said happily. "We gotta do this again sometime, Smiley." Miley grinned.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Whenever you want, Silly… whenever you want."</i></p>
<p>"<i>You know what I want right now?" Lilly asked.</i></p>
<p>"<i>It better not be more popcorn," Miley teased her. Lilly shook her head.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Nope," she said simply. "This." With that, she curled up against Miley and closed her eyes. Miley smiled, a feeling of warmth and contentment washing over her at the sudden nearness of her best friend. Resting her head gently against Lilly's, Miley closed her eyes and let sleep take her as well.</i></p>
<p><i>By the time Susan Stewart returned to check on the girls a short while later, she found them fast asleep in each other's arms, happy smiles still on their faces…</i></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"That was the very first night I ever slept in your arms," Lilly said softly, smiling happily. "Heck, that was the first time I ever slept in <i>anyone</i>'s arms… and moms don't count!" Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"I think that was the first time I realized… just how much you meant to me," the young singer replied, her voice growing husky.</p>
<p>"Back atcha, Miles," Lilly replied, smiling as well. "You've never been shy about showing it either." Miley blushed slightly.</p>
<p>"You know when I realized it the most?" Lilly continued. Miley looked at her expectantly.</p>
<p>"When I heard you telling your mamaw about me, the first time I met her," Lilly replied after a moment, and even after all the years that had passed since then, she felt her eyes grow moist again.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe you were standing there the whole time," Miley replied in a soft voice. "I thought I was gonna die of embarrassment!" Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"It was really, really sweet Miles… and I'll never forget it."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>SIX YEARS AGO…</p>
<p>"<i>Morning, Mamaw," Miley called out softly as she walked into the kitchen in her grandmother's home.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Good morning, sweetheart," Ruthie Stewart greeted her granddaughter warmly. "How are you feeling this morning, Miley honey?" Miley shrugged. It had barely been a week since her beloved mother had been taken from her, and her heart still ached terribly from the loss. Only the love and company of her best friend Lilly had been able to soothe some of the pain.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Okay, I guess," she answered her grandmother solemnly.</i></p>
<p>"<i>I know it hurts, sweetheart," Ruthie said tenderly. "Give it time." She hugged her granddaughter tenderly for a moment, then slowly released her.</i></p>
<p>"<i>I'm fixing some breakfast, if you're hungry," she said softly.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Maybe," Miley said hesitantly. "I haven't had much of an appetite lately… but Lilly says I need to keep my strength up."</i></p>
<p>"<i>She's right," Ruthie agreed with a smile. "By the way, where is she? There's plenty for her too." Miley smiled a little at the thought of her best friend.</i></p>
<p>"<i>She's still asleep, mamaw," Miley replied. "After everything she's done for me, I thought letting her sleep in was the least I could do." Ruthie smiled gently.</i></p>
<p>"<i>You really care about her, don't you?" she asked softly. Miley blushed slightly.</i></p>
<p>"<i>She's been a really great friend, mamaw," she answered quietly. "She has been, ever since we first met."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Your father said something about that," Ruthie responded. "Said you came home after you first day of school, all excited about meeting a new friend."</i></p>
<p>"<i>I was all by myself out on the playground, and Lilly just walked up and asked if she could play hopscotch with me," Miley replied with a shy smile. "Right from the beginning, she went out of her way to be my friend."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Sounds like she really cares about you, too," Ruthie remarked with a smile.</i></p>
<p>"<i>I've never had a friend quite like her," Miley admitted. "She's always there for me when I need her, and she never asks for anything. When I'm with her…I always feel happy, and wanted."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Lilly sounds like a wonderful friend to me," Ruthie told her granddaughter. "I think you're lucky to have her in your life."</i></p>
<p>"<i>I am, mamaw… I am. I think… I think I love her." Miley didn't realize Lilly had been standing behind her, listening, for the last few minutes. When she awoke to find Miley gone, she automatically went looking for, and found her in the kitchen talking to her grandmother. She had never expected to hear Miley saying such touching things about her, though.</i></p>
<p>"<i>I have a feeling Lilly feels the same way about you, sweetheart," Ruthie said gently, and she smiled over at Lilly. "In fact, you could ask her right now."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Huh?" Miley replied, not understanding. Then she felt a familiar pair of arms wrap around her from behind in a warm hug.</i></p>
<p>"<i>L-Lilly?" Miley stammered.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Uh huh," Lilly answered.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Did you… did you hear what I was saying?" Miley asked nervously.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Yeah I did," Lilly answered softly, "and I love you too, Miles." Miley swallowed.</i></p>
<p>"<i>You're the best friend I've ever had, Lilly," she whispered. Lilly smiled through her tears.</i></p>
<p>"<i>I promise, I'll always be here when you need me," she whispered back. "You're the best friend </i>I've<i> ever had too… and I don't ever wanna lose you."</i></p>
<p>"<i>No chance of that," Miley replied happily, and she closed her eyes and leaned into the warm hug with a contented sigh. Across the room, Ruthie smiled warmly as she watched her granddaughter and her best friend lovingly embrace each other. For the first time since poor Susan's death, Miley seemed truly happy… and Ruthie felt truly grateful for the blonde tomboy she knew was responsible.</i></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"I swear, you just like making me cry," Lilly teased her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Miley said playfully, and Lilly stuck out her tongue. "You know what I love to do even more?" Miley asked her. When Lilly did not respond, Miley leaned in and kissed her gently.</p>
<p>"Mmmm…" Lilly growled appreciatively. "You can do that anytime you want." Miley smirked.</p>
<p>"As long as I don't ever have to let you go," Miley replied warmly, and she punctuated the statement with a soft, warm kiss on the side of Lilly's neck, causing her girlfriend to inhale sharply.</p>
<p>"Forever, Miles," she breathed. "I want to stay with you forever, Miles."</p>
<p>"Forever it is," Miley whispered back, and with a grin, she kissed Lilly hungrily, reveling in all the wonderful feelings kissing and holding the woman she loved always filled her with. Deep in her heart, Miley knew she never wanted those feelings to end… and she never wanted to let Lilly go.</p>
<p>The gentle kissing soon led to something more, and Miley began to gently undress the blonde haired angel lying beneath her. Lilly hissed softly as Miley began to kiss her way, softly yet hungrily, down over her girlfriend's bare skin.</p>
<p>"I love you," Miley whispered as she began to make sweet and wonderful love to Lilly, and the soft moans her kisses and caresses coaxed from the woman she loved soon filled Miley with an already familiar fire.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miley… so much…" Lilly managed to whisper, before Miley's head dipped lower and completed took her breath away. Miley knew then and there she never wanted to feel this way with anyone else, and that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with Lilly… and whatever was beyond that</p>
