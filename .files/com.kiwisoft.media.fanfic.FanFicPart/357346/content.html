<!-- Just a Day in the Life \ Chapter 4-->

<p>Almost instantly after the warlock finished the summoning, they all heard a voice ringing in their heads.  Buffy clung to it; it was a mother's voice, warm and comforting.  Even Riley heard it, although he could barely draw breath and his blood was pounding in his ears.</p>
<p>"Why have you summoned Me?"  A figure appeared in the column of light above the altar.  She had firey red hair, and was wearing flowing robes which were at once all colors and no color.  Willow gaped at the figure of the goddess hovering above the altar.</p>
<p>The warlock stepped forward, and said, "I have summoned you to receive your gifts, goddess Brigid."</p>
<p>The goddess looked down at him, and replied, "And why would I give My gifts to one so selfish, so destructive?"  She turned away from him, saying, "You are beneath My notice."</p>
<p>The warlock looked surprised and angry.  He said, "I have summoned you! You must do MY bidding! I demand that you grant me the power in your gifts!"</p>
<p>What happened next stunned the warlock; the goddess laughed, and her laugh was pure music.  "I am not some lesser creature to be so commanded by a ritual and petty incantation.  Your work with the Lower Denizens has corrupted your mind and soul.  You're not the One.  But you, on the other hand..." The goddess looked down at Willow, who was still cradling her friend.  "I will ask you a question."</p>
<p>"Y...yes," Willow stammered, looking up at the goddess.</p>
<p>"Many mortal lifetimes ago, I was revered as the patron of fire, and life.  Creation and destruction.  Inspiration and finality.  I can grant you the power to bring life and health to the injured, or I can grant you the power to consume your enemies in fire, and protect the innocent.  Which would you choose?"</p>
<p>Willow looked down at her best friend, her love; Buffy's face was ashen.  Willow wiped away tears, and replied, "I would choose to heal."</p>
<p>The goddess Brigid smiled down on the girl.  "So it shall be."  She raised her hand, and a golden glow surrounded Willow.  She looked down at Buffy, and knew at once she had the power to save her.  She pulled the knife out of Buffy's chest with one fast, smooth motion.  Buffy gasped, and blood started welling out of the open wound.  Willow placed both hands over the wound, and concentrated.  A golden glow began to be emitted from her palms, and immediately warmth and color returned to Buffy's face.  She opened her eyes, and looked up at Willow.  The sheer love in her gaze cut straight to Willow's heart.</p>
<p>Before either of them could say a word, the warlock let out a bestial cry of anger.  "I still have enough power to destroy you all!" He yelled, and raised his hand.  In one smooth motion, Buffy grabbed the sacrificial knife, and threw.</p>
<p>The warlock looked down in surprise at the knife handle protruding from the center of his chest.  "But I..." was the only thing he had a chance to say before he slumped down behind the altar, and death claimed him.</p>
<p>"How did you..." Willow looked at Buffy.  Buffy shrugged.  "It was the closest thing at hand.  Also, it figures.  He needed that knife to cut his palm, he wouldn't have used it if he were immune."  The two women looked at each other, and Buffy raised her hand to brush Willow's hair back from her face.  "I owe you my life, Will," she said, softly.</p>
<p>Willow blushed, and replied, "You've saved my life so often, I can't even keep track anymore.  I don't know what I would do without you.  I'm just glad I was able to do something to help you."</p>
<p>"It looks like I have made the right choice," the goddess said, startling them all.  "You will make a fine Avatar, and the two of you together will be a powerful force for good.  Now, Avatar, I think you have another life that needs saving, and I will go.  We shall see each other again."  With that, the goddess vanished, and the clearing was lit only by the bonfire once more.</p>
<p>"Another life...oh my god, Riley!" Willow ran over to where Riley lay on the clearing floor, gasping for breath.  She placed her hands over his injured throat, and began to concentrate.  A golden glow enveloped his neck, and soon his breathing eased.  "Willow, how?" Riley looked up at the witch, the glow from her hands fading.</p>
<p>"Just more of that mystical mumbo-jumbo," Buffy said, smiling.  She came up behind Willow and put her hands on the redhead's shoulders.  "Warlocks, magic, goddesses, mystical healing powers...It's all part of a day in the life of the Slayer."</p>
<p>"And the Witch," Willow added, standing next to her.  She took Buffy's hand in her own, and smiled at her best friend.  <I>Partners, best friends, and now...what next?</I> Willow smiled at the thought.  "C'mon," she said, leading Buffy out of the clearing, "Let's go home."</p>
<p>Buffy laughed, and followed saying, "Whatever you say, Will."</p>
<p>Riley watched the two girls leave, and he looked around the clearing, lost in thought.  He sat there for a long time.</p>
