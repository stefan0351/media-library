<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 38 -->

<p>Brooke and Sam marched silently towards the house having been summoned by
their parents moments after Mary Cherry, Popita and a reluctant Nicole, made
their escape.  Sam was certain that if she listened very carefully she could
hear a dirge being carried through the air towards them.</p>

<p>Upon entering the house they were then instructed to go into the living room
and sit down where they would wait patiently to be joined by their parents.
This was related to them in no uncertain terms, and they complied like well
trained boarder collies in the plains of Alberta.</p>

<p>Finally, after leaving the girls to sit in a tortured silence the parental
units entered the room directing the girls to sit on the couch side by side,
where they then took up residence beside their particular child.</p>

<p>“So we had an interesting little chat with Mary Cherry,” Jane began calmly.
She felt like she was dying inside.</p>

<p>“Interesting,” Mike confirmed.  This was ridiculous, Brooke wasn’t even gay.</p>

<p>Brooke and Sam, who had decided that staring at their feet was a brilliant
course of action the moment their parents walked in to the room, decided
that that was still an appropriate course of action and continued to do so
effectively not responding to their parents comments.</p>

<p>“Do you have any idea what we might have chatted about?” Jane asked when it
became clear that neither girl was going to say anything.  This inquiry too
was met by silence. “Sam?”</p>

<p>“Dolce and Gabbana?” Sam responded in a quiet and somewhat pained tone.</p>

<p>“Do you want to guess again?” Jane asked not terribly impressed with her
daughters answer.</p>

<p>“I would prefer not to,” Sam responded honestly, her eyes still firmly
planted on her feet.</p>

<p>Once again the room was covered in silence.</p>

<p>“Mary Cherry indicated…that is to say from her impression…that you, Brooke
and you…Sam…are…which is to say…involved…as it were,” Mike said stumbling
over his words.  He wasn’t quite sure how one went about telling ones own
daughter and the daughter of ones fiancé that one had heard that one’s said
daughter and soon to be step-daughter were engaged in sexual congress.</p>

<p>“In a romantic sense…to phrase it, well, as a phrase,” Jane added trying to
clarify what Mike had begun and only partially succeeding.</p>

<p>In response their question Brooke blinked and twitched her nose while Sam
sniffled and tugged at her ear lobe.</p>

<p>“Do either of you have anything to say?” Mike asked finally at a loss for
what else to do.  They certain weren’t making this easy.</p>

<p>There was a momentarily silence after he posed the question then Sam
responded with,  “The Bronx Zoo has a pair of male chimps who’ve formed a
life bond and who forage and swing together, gathering food in preparation
for disaster — because they don’t know they’re in a zoo.  Their monkeys
after all.  It’s apparently quite moving.  I’ve also heard they have a tap
show.”</p>

<p>This was met by the parents simultaneous and understandable exclamation of,
“ What!?!”</p>

<p>This was in turn met by Brooke, who after inserting her thumb into her mouth
and biting down on it, mumbled, “I’m not pregnant, which I think in any
situation…except for you know in cases of planned parenthood, is a good
thing.  Especially for a teenager…and especially-especially for one who
cheerleads…or hikes, or swims, or something…you know?”</p>

<p>After that last bout of incomprehensibility Jane and Mike looked around
their daughters at each other completely and utterly confused.  Mike figured
that what had just transpired was at least partially his fault for only
demanding an answer, not one that made sense.  It became clear to him that
they were going to get nowhere with the discussion if they continued to beat
around the block, and looking at Jane he could see that she had reached the
same conclusion so, after a silent battle of the wills, Mike addressed the
girls once more.</p>

<p>“Obviously there’s only…we’re just going to have to be straight forward
here.”  He paused here to take a deep breath, then, “Are the two of you
involved with each other romantically?  Called dating in some circles.”</p>

<p>The girls turn to look at each other communicating silently.  They seem to
agree that the parents knew, and that the best course of action is to just
be honest.</p>

<p>Brooke opened her mouth as if to responded, then closed it just as quickly
her eyes returning to the floor.  She remained quiet like that for a moment
before she took a deep breath and looked up again, this time when she opened
her mouth the word “yes” escaped, although it was barely audible.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Jane asked dumbly.  Truthfully, she hadn’t really expected either of
them to admit it.  She had expected to be able to go on believing that Mary
Cherry was just a crack baby.  She was wrong.</p>

<p>Sam pinched the bridge of her nose, she felt a migraine coming on.  Sucking
in a deep breath, she turned to her mother and said “yes” in a breathy voice
that was just barely audible.  It was audible however, and was met with a
steely silence.</p>

<p>“Since?” Mike asked taking in a deep breath, and trying to curb the hysteria
that was rapidly building up inside of him.</p>

<p>It was Brooke who answered this time, her gaze once again focused intently
on her shoes.  “While you were in Hawaii we…gained closeness,” she related
in a highly uncomfortable voice shifting in her seat jostling her already
discombobulated father.</p>

<p>Jane took in a deep, shuddering breath, then raised her hand to her head as
her shoulders shook slightly.  She was not prepared to deal with this.  Sam
and Brooke, despite what she had seen, she had never thought, never would
have thought, couldn’t have bared to think about it.  But there it was.</p>

<p>“That’s…a while,” she finally said in a hushed tone, her voice cracking as
she spoke.  She raised her hand to her face again brushing a stray strand of
hair behind her ear, trying to psych herself up for her next question.
“Have you…” she paused her taking another deep breath, at least oxygen
deprivation wouldn’t be a problem for her,  “been intimate?” she finally
asked.  Once the question was out of her mouth, she realized that the answer
was bound to disappoint her however it went.  If it was yes, then it was
yes, if it was no, then it was a yet.</p>

<p>“Mom!” Sam squeaked jumping up off the couch.  She was seriously distressed.
  “You don’t…you can’t…boundaries…” she muttered calming down and bit and
sitting back down when her mother motioned for her to do so.  “You just
don’t…” she continued lamely looking at the cactus plant in the corner of
the room like it was her new best friend.</p>

<p>“Brooke?” Mike asked anxiously seriously unnerved by Sam’s reaction.  What
the hell was that?</p>

<p>Brooke looked at him blinking rapidly.  “I … we … what?” was all she was
able to get out before she dissolved into merely opening and closing her
mouth, while occasionally scrunching up her brow in a look of intense
consternation.</p>

<p>Mike and Jane turned and looked at each other.  They could see it in each
others eyes.  They were human, and they had been kids, and they both knew
without a doubt that what their daughters lack of an answer meant was ‘yes’,
yes they had.  They had but they couldn’t make themselves say it.</p>

<p>“We have to go,” Mike responded finally.  “Talk.  We have to go talk,” he
continued haltingly looking over at Jane, who didn’t seem to be faring much
better than he himself was.</p>

<p>“Yes, talk,” Jane responded slowly, her mind slowly clearing a little.
“Until…until,” Jane continued lamely,  “Sam will be staying with me in the
guest room,” she continued, lucid enough to realize that this was a
necessary course of action.</p>

<p>“Mom!” Sam exclaimed, her proclivity towards indignation momentarily
overwhelming her common sense.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” Jane said turning to her warningly.   “You don’t even want to hear
what my response would be,” she continued in a low voice.  Sam was quiet
after that, thankful to still be alive.</p>

<p>“I get to stay in my room right?” Brooke asked.  Mike responded by shooting
her gaze of arctic temperature, and like Sam she too was quiet again.</p>

<p>After that was decided, Mike and Jane stood up, and headed out of the room,
leaving the two quiet girls sitting on the couch.  They both followed their
parents progress, sighing deeply and leaning back against the back of the
couch once they had exited the room.</p>

<p>“You know that this has only just begun,” Brooke commented her eyes closing.
  She felt like she was going to cry, it was so depressing.  The lying had
been going so very, very well for them.  Grey skies were finally starting to
clear up, and now this.</p>

<p>“I have to move in with my mom,” Sam responded, still harping on her mothers
last declaration.</p>

<p>“They’re gonna be watching us like hawks,” Brooke pointed out pouting.</p>

<p>“I have to move in with my mom,” Sam responded.  She seemed to be having
difficulties moving past this particular particular.</p>

<p>“Schools going to be the fun part,” Brooke replied.</p>

<p>“This is so sad,” Sam breathed out turning to look at Brooke.</p>

<p>“I’m going to kill Mary Cherry,” the cheerleader declared a moment later.
Sam was right, this was very sad and Mary Cherry was to blame.  Well,
certainly, she and Sam played a little part in it, but it was much easier to
blame Mary Cherry.</p>

<p>“I’ll be your alibi,” Sam responded.</p>

<p>“Acceptable,” Brooke responded.  They were young, and pretty, they could
beat any criminal charges couldn’t they?</p>

<p>“What now?” Sam asked looking at Brooke searching for answers.</p>

<p>“I was planning on being silent and morose for a while. You could be
brooding and introspective?” Brooke suggested at a complete loss as to what
else to do.</p>

<p>“Sounds good,” Sam responded.</p>

<p>And there was quiet in the room once again.</p>
