<p>Rory Gilmore and Paris Geller.</p>
<p>I bet you think we make an odd pair.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I would have agreed with you. She
simply couldn't stand me, and I viewed her as a whiny,
goody-goody. We'd snipe, and argue, and continue to
one-up each other. That's how everyone knew all was
right with the world.</p>
<p>Then we started having to cooperate on certain things.
School assignments, the newspaper, things like that.
We actually started getting along. It's hard to say
which of us found that more odd.</p>
<p>Then, to my shock - hell, to my utter horror - I found
myself starting to *like* her. I didn't mention it to
Madeline or Louise, because, well, I couldn't. Though
if it was only that, I might have been able to handle
it. But when she began having trouble with that
boyfriend of hers - Dean something-or-other - and I
found myself wanting nothing more than to gather her
into my arms, stroke her doubtlessly silky long hair,
and whisper reassurances into her ear... Well, that
freaked me. Big time.</p>
<p>After that, I had trouble looking at her. Everytime I
did, my attention kept drifting to her soft lips, and
I'd begin wondering what it would be like to kiss her,
touch her... I can't help but wonder if she noticed
anything different in my reaction to Tristin's
flirting with her after that. Yes, I was jealous and
angry, but not because of her. Now it was because of
*him*, because *he* got to flirt with Rory, while I
couldn't. And thinking that she might actually have
been interested in him... That just hurt. Because I
was supposed to hate her, after all. And, naturally,
she and Dean soon got back together. At the very
least, that stopped Tristin's flirting with her cold.</p>
<p>The worst thing I've had to go through because of her,
I think, was the summer we spent in Washington, D.C.
Yes, 'we'. As in, together. In the same room. For two
months. There were times when I'd wake up and see her
laying there, the sun shining down on her hair, her
face relaxed as she quietly slept (thankfully, she
doesn't snore), and it would take every last bit of
control I had to keep from going over to her bed and
cuddling up next to her. Yeah, *that* wouldn't have
freaked her out or anything, nooooooo. Thankfully, I'd
gotten rather good at surpressing my hormonal
responses by then, so I'd just go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, so there was that one time... But I was very
quiet! I'm actually sort of proud of that, in a really
weird sort of way. The strongest orgasm I can ever
remember having, and she didn't hear a thing.</p>
<p>Of course, there were a few times she told me she'd
woken up to hear me mutteing something in my sleep,
once mentioning her name. I was positively mortified,
but passed it off with some excuse about being excited
about the upcoming Congressional session that we got
to sit in on. She seemed to buy it, as she never
brought the incident up again.</p>
<p>Then I had to endure the Rory-Dean-Jess triangle.
Sure, it was going on in Stars Hollow, so I didn't
have to *see* it (which I count my blessings for, as I
just know I would have done something incredibly
stupid if exposed to that testosterone display), but I
heard plenty about it from Rory. Yes, she willingly
told me personal details about her life. I told you,
things had changed from when we first met. I'd made
sure she knew she could talk to me about things. I
have no doubt that she tells her friend Lane more, but
they've been friends their entire lives, if I
understand correctly. There's no way I can compete
with that, so I'm not even going to try. She'll tell
me what she tells me, and that'll have to be enough.</p>
<p>And judging by what she's told me, I'm not the only
one who was relieved when Jess finally left to go find
his father, or whatever. It seems the whole town was
getting sick of him. I haven't been to Stars Hollow
all that many times, but evidently the people living
there are a lot more sensible than I've given them
credit for.</p>
<p>I'm honestly not sure what the future holds, and I
don't mean just for me. I also mean about Rory and
Dean. One would have expected her, after Jess left, to
settle down happily with Dean. But I can't help but
sense some tension there, that she's purposefully
holding herself back. Of course, that *could* just be
wishful thinking, on my part. It seems that we'll both
be going to Harvard. I can't help but wonder if I
could convince her to be my roommate... No. That
wouldn't be a good idea. After all, if I could barely
take *two* months alone with her, how would I ever
stand the other eight? But I'm sure I'll see her
around the campus a lot. I guess I can only hope that
she sees me as enough of a friend to keep from dodging
me, like we'd "agreed" to when we first found out that
we both wanted to go to the same university. I'd like
to think she does, but we haven't really talked about
it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. I'm such a coward. But I can't help it.
The thought of her rejecting me... I can't even
describe how much that hurts.</p>
<p>So I'll keep waiting for my chance. I know what you're
thinking: that doesn't really seem like my style. But
there *are* some things in life worth waiting for.</p>
<p>And to me, Rory is the best one.</p>
