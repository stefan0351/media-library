<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 10: Conversation With Dumb People -->

<p>It was the day after the big fight with Brooke and Sam was nervously walking through the crowded halls of Kennedy High in search of the tall blonde.</p>
<p>Sam searched every corner of the school but still no signs of Brooke. The hole in her stomach had turned into the Grand Canyon. If she didn't find Brooke soon she would pass out from pure agony. As she rounded the corner heading towards the Novak, she bumped in to Carmen and Lily.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Sam said without noticing it was her friends she'd bumped in to.</p>
<p>Lily managed to grab a hold on Sam's arm before she got away from them. "Sam?"</p>
<p>Sam turned around seeing Lily and Carmen looking at her with questioning looks.</p>
<p>"Oh, It's you guys. Sorry, I didn't see you." Sam said looking both ways down the hall like a maniac.</p>
<p>"Are you okay Sam?" Carmen asked trying to get the brunette's attention.</p>
<p>"I don't... It's... We... Me and Brooke kinda...."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Me and Brooke had a fight yesterday."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's why Brooke was acting so strange when we bumped into her in the Novak." Carmen said.</p>
<p>"W-w-what when?" Sam asked with eyes that looked like they were going to pop out of their sockets any second.</p>
<p>"Just a couple of minutes ago..." Lily didn't have the chance to finish her sentence before Sam was nothing but a dash on the way to the Novak, much like Flash Gordon.</p>
<p>Lily and Carmen looked at each other shrugging and headed for the Novak in a slower pace.</p>
<p>When they entered the Novak, they found Sam sitting on the settee in the middle of the Novak crying her eyes out. It was odd for the two brunettes to see Sam like that. She rarely showed emotions like that, especially not in school.</p>
<p>The brunettes sat them selves down with Sam. Carmen put her arm around her and Sam buried her face in Carmen's shoulder. Lily made an icky face when she saw Sam's snot all over Carmen's blouse.</p>
<p>"Why were you guys fighting?" Lily asked, rather surprised. This was the first time there had been reports of any fighting in the six months Sam and Brooke had been together. Lily figured there would never be any major fighting between those two cause they were one of those lucky couples that are etch others perfect match.</p>
<p>"Yhmphmpm umphmphmp" Sam said into Carmen's shoulder.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Uhm, Sam, you're gonna choke on my shoulder." Carmen said gently removing Sam from her shoulder.</p>
<p>Sam wiped away the tears from her eyes and cleared her throat. "I said you would never understand."</p>
<p>"At least we could try." Carmen gave the brunette an encouraging smile.</p>
<p>"It can't that bad... can it?"</p>
<p>"It's so bad."</p>
<p>"Spill it Sam."</p>
<p>"Okay, but do you promise to hear me out before you freak out?"</p>
<p>Both brunettes nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>Sam took a deep breath and stood up. She tried to figure out a smooth way to lay it all down to friends. However, she realized there was no smooth way to explain this. If she were lucky, Lily and Carmen would be more understanding and maybe even believe her.</p>
<p>"Okay; I am pregnant, Brooke did it but she thinks I've cheated on her which I haven't."</p>
<p>"Say what?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed. "I'm pregnant."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed again "I. Am. Pregnant."</p>
<p>Both brunettes in front of Sam stared at her with their jaws opened wide. A long awkward silence followed. Well, at least it was awkward for Sam. Lily and Carmen were not moving nor talking. Luckily enough, Carmen broke the silence with a hysterical chuckle followed by Lily's girly giggles. But the room was yet again filled with an awkward silence when both brunettes on the settee noticed Sam's new expression. She was leaning against the sinks with her arms around her chest pouting and rolling her eyes. They recognized that face. Sam was serious, this wasn't even funny.</p>
<p>"Are you serious Sam?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"But how... I mean... Brooke is... you are... How?" Carmen was obviously the most confused brunette in that room.</p>
<p>"I don't know." Sam was very serious now. It was her only defense.</p>
<p>"But you're both..." Carmen stopped her self mid-sentence and stared at Sam with her mouth opened and her eyes wide. "OMG... OMG... OMG." Was the only thing she managed to say.</p>
<p>"What? What?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me Brooke is actually a... man!"</p>
<p>Now it was Sam's turn to laugh. She was laughing so hard her stomach started to ache.</p>
<p>"No! She's not a man."</p>
<p>"Then how come you are pregnant? Are you sure Sam? Have you..."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes Lily! I am sure, 100% sure. I've done all the tests, I AM SURE!" Sam said throwing her arms up in the air.</p>
<p>"I-I-I'm not following you Sam." Said Carmen and Lily nod in agreement.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Sam, are you ok? Have you eaten something from your closet again?"</p>
<p>"No!" The two clueless brunettes were really getting on Sam's last nerves. She never expected them to react so stupidly. She took out the papers from the last pregnancy test and handed it to Lily. "Read."</p>
<p>Lily read the paper and handed it to Carmen. When she was finished reading it both girls started first at each other and at Sam.</p>
<p>"Okay, who's the father Sam?" Lily asked standing up.</p>
<p>"It's Brooke."</p>
<p>"Seriously Sam!"</p>
<p>"I am serious!"</p>
<p>"Ugh, come on! You know that's impossible!"</p>
<p>"It's not!"</p>
<p>"Sam, get a grip! You know you can trust us, come on! Who's the father? Harrison?"</p>
<p>"OMG! Lily! Why does everybody automatically assume I've slept with Harrison? You of all people know I never had feeling for Harrison..."</p>
<p>"I don't ... Okay I'm sorry. Just tell us."</p>
<p>"You know what Lily?" Carmen managed to say after a couple of seconds of silently watching the conversation between Lily and Sam like a game of tennis. "I don't care who the father is, I don't think that's important. What's important is that we have to be there for Sam in times of need and/or crisis no matter what. I know I wasn't around that much after the accident and the whole thing with Brooke, but I've told you I'm sorry and that I wish I was. This time I'm 100% with you Sam."</p>
<p>A great big shiny smile appeared on Sam's face. She hadn't felt this happy in weeks. The only thing that could really make her day was the support from the people she loved. If only Brooke could be this supportive, it would be heaven.</p>
<p>Lily remembered the lyrics from that Placebo song... "A friend in need's a friend indeed" and decided that she had to support Sam on this one.</p>
<p>"I'm withya Sam." Lily said giving Sam a hug. "But you know this whole 'Brooke is my baby's daddy' thing is kinda strange."</p>
<p>Sam just had to laugh. Indeed this was a weird situation but Carmen and Lily hade given her new hope. All of the sudden it didn't feel so hopeless with Brooke. She was sure she could win her back one way or the other. That's when she decides she was going to prove that she was no loony and that she was too pregnant by Brooke.</p>
<p>"I think I know a way to prove to you all I'm not some crazed pregnant freak."</p>
<p>Both Carmen and Lily laughed. "Yeah sure Sam, but how're you gonna do that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll see. Sam said in her usual self-confident kinda way. "But you can't tell anybody about this, okay?" Both girls nod.</p>
<p>"Shit! We're late for class." Both Lily and Carmen headed for the door but Sam didn't move, she was too busy making genius plans.</p>
<p>"Aren't you coming Sam?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh, naah I'll catch up with you guys in the cafeteria."</p>
