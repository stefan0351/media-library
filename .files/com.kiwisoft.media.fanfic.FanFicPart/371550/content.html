<P>Olivia and Viola met two days after the experience, of which Olivia will tell you was an enjoyable experience and Viola will groan and tell you she doesn't want to go back. Unless Olivia is also present when you talk to Viola, then to spare Olivia's feelings, Viola will tell you the truth in respective terms. "It needs improvement", much like Sebastian and Olivia's relationship which hasn't fared any better since the classes either.</p>
<P>Viola and Olivia were currently performing their homework from the class, intimate stretching, Viola would have had no trouble with this if Olivia was actually her girlfriend, but the thought of Olivia performing these stretchers with her and then climbing into Sebastian's bed at night. It made her feel sick, it was like she was getting the bad parts of a relationship she wasn't even in. She was having to work to keep a relationship that wasn't even hers. To keep the girl she so desperately wanted in a relationship with her brother.</p>
<P>Viola cursed Sebastian as Olivia let out another groan, as the stretch continued, she had been enduring this groaning for the past half an hour, which had been harder than it was first thought to be. Having the girl you love mere centimeter's from your face groaning, because of what your doing to her. But knowing at the end of the day she'll go back her succumb boyfriend, whose also your brother. Life really sucked sometimes.</p>
<P>"Viola", said Olivia, trying to wake Viola from another one of her day dreams, Olivia had to admit Viola did look cute when she spaced out, but during stretching was not a good time.</p>
<P>"Viola!", Olivia tried again, the burn on her inner thigh was getting pretty intense and if Viola didn't stop applying pressure soon, it was going to hurt a whole lot more.</p>
<P>"VIOLA!", yelled Olivia, Viola jumped and looked at her.</p>
<P>"It hurts", said Olivia, Viola looked confused, then it clicked.</p>
<P>"Oh Liv, I am so sorry", she said jumping off.</p>
<P>"Its okay", said Olivia, sitting up.</p>
<P>"Here let me see", said Viola, moving Olivia's hand from her inner thigh.</p>
<P>"No seriously its... fine", said Olivia as Viola put her hand on Olivia's inner thigh.</p>
<P>Before Viola new what she was doing she gently began to massage the skin on Olivia's inner thigh.</p>
<P>"Better?", asked Viola as she kept minimal pressure to that point.</p>
<P>Olivia couldn't respond she'd never felt this way before, even in her and Sebastian's "most intimate moment" she had never felt anything like this. Looking up into Viola's eyes, she saw all the innocences and love she had seen in the Sebastian she had first fallen for back in high school.</p>
<P>Viola removed her hand when Olivia didn't respond.</p>
<P>"Well it should be better soon", said Viola, just realizing what she had done, she looked away blushing from the closeness.</p>
<P>"Viola?" asked Olivia.</p>
<P>"Yeah", said Viola, turning back to face Olivia.</p>
<P>"I... never mind.. I should probably go", said Olivia jumping up.</p>
<P>They were in Viola's dorm room, so Viola was not dressed as Sebastian, there was no deluding herself, into thinking her feelings were for Sebastian. Olivia had felt that feeling once before today and it was only with Sebastian. Worse still it had only been when Viola was Sebastian.</p>
<P>"Okay, I'll see you at class", said Viola as Olivia rushed out the door.</p>
<P>'<I>Look what you done now Hastings you scared her off</I>', thought Viola and not only to herself, Sebastian had a lot to do with why Olivia was always upset. The terrible twins had messed up another innocent.</p>
<P>Viola sighed, it was about time she had a talk with Sebastian, she grabbed her bag and the notes she had taken from the class and went to find her brother.</p>
