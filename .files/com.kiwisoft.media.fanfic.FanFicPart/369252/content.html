<p><b>Chapter 6</b></p>
<p><b> .</b></p>
<p>Lilly was practically humming as she stepped out of her SUV. It was a nice day; cloudy, not too hot and, most importantly, it was Friday. Her parents were out on a date, and her brother was off with some of his new friends, leaving the whole house to Lilly alone. Finally she could watch TV by herself, or play her brother's Xbox or turn up the music really loud. The only way Lilly's night could get better would be if she'd get to spend it with Miley, but she was still, or again, grounded.</p>
<p>They hadn't seen each other since last Saturday at the creek and Lilly was starting to get antsy. She had no idea how Miley felt about her; the girl was just too hard to read to really make sense of her, admittedly very flirty, actions. Miley had snuck a call to Lilly during the week, to let her know her punishment had been extended. Apparently her wardens had also gotten wise to her tricks, as Lilly truly had not seen her around. She thought about fidgety, over-excited Miley stuck in that tiny cabin all week, without even school to give her a reprieve and frowned.</p>
<p>She pushed open the door to the diner, used to the way all patrons turned to look at the newcomer by now. Lilly was not a fan of cooking. Her parents had left her some money for food and, since the only pizza place in Crowley was awful, she'd decided to just get take-out from the diner. With Miley's help, she'd learned to navigate the few safe menu items quite effectively.</p>
<p>Lilly went up to the bar, but noticed someone sitting in what was normally Miley's booth and walked closer. She frowned as she stepped up to the table. The normally exuberant brunette had the hood from her sweatshirt drawn over her head, which was bedded on her arms resting on the table. There was no shredded napkin tower and the girl didn't move as Lilly approached. Lilly sat on the bench next to Miley and the girl's head jerked up. She looked utterly horrible, but gave Lilly a weak smile anyway.</p>
<p>"Hey there, cutie." Miley's eyes were glassy, her skin sweaty and pale, but she still managed to send Lilly's head into a spin.</p>
<p>Lilly forced the rising excitement at the flirtatious greeting aside, concentrating on the girl next to her. She did not hesitate to reach out a hand and feel the girl's forehead, though blushed as soon as she realized how forward she was being. Miley, as always, did not care.</p>
<p>"You're burning up, Miley. What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged half-heartedly. "Just a cold or something. I feel like road kill."</p>
<p>Lilly snorted. "How do you know what road kill feels like?" Miley merely shrugged again and Lilly shook her head. "Why are you even here? I thought you were grounded. And you should probably be in bed."</p>
<p>Miley grinned, though it was weak compared to her usual grins that lit up her entire face. "You want me in bed, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Lilly suppressed a groan. Was it even possible Miley was more flirty, impossible and confusing when she was sick? It took several more moments, before Miley actually answered her question. "Mom made me come, 'cause I'm grounded and grandma's in Murfreesboro buying her supplies. She's afraid I'll abscond again."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, thinking of Miley the escape artist, but it faded again when she saw how miserable the girl was. A glass of water and a plate of fries sat in front of her untouched. Lilly knew Miley must really be feeling horrible if not even the prospect of hot-sauce drenched fries appealed to her. She rubbed a hand up and down the girl's back to comfort her without thinking, but suddenly Miley's head was on her shoulder. Lilly's hand was still on her back and with the way Miley was twisted into her, they were almost wrapped in an embrace. Lilly flushed, though she tried to tell herself it was merely from the extreme heat radiating off of the girl.</p>
<p>"You smell good," mumbled Miley against her neck and Lilly's breath hitched, feeling the girl's hot breath against her skin. She wouldn't fault anyone for saying strange things while having a fever, but she knew Miley would have said that regardless, and smiled.</p>
<p>Someone sat in the booth across from them and Lilly nearly jumped. Miley's mom did not look thrilled to see her and Lilly wondered whether it was merely her presence or her current compromising position that pissed the woman off. She didn't know what she'd done to make Miley's mom dislike her. The woman did not acknowledge her, however, instead looking at her daughter.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling, sweet pea?"</p>
<p>Miley made a sort of grunting noise against Lilly's neck, as if it were plenty of answer. Lilly decided, as much as Miley's mom intimidated her, she'd have to stick up for Miley; a smelly diner was no place to be when you were sick. "She said something about road kill."</p>
<p>A small smile graced the woman's lips and she shook her head. "Oh, Miley…look hun, there's no one to cover my shift. I can't leave for another two hours. Think you can stick it out?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," replied Miley, voice muffled; she had yet to move from her current position. Lilly felt annoyance bubble up inside of her at the woman's question. Couldn't she see Miley was really sick? Respecting your elders be damned, she thought.</p>
<p>"She's really burning up. She needs to be in bed," said Lilly, surprising herself with how stern her voice sounded.</p>
<p>Miley's mom was clearly clenching her jaw and Lilly momentarily regretted her outburst, but then the woman ran a hand across her face with a sigh. "Look, Lilly," said Miley's mom, making her name almost sound like a four-letter word. "I can't leave and I'm not letting Miley walk alone through town…when she's like this."</p>
<p>Lilly felt she had added the last part just to cover up the fact she didn't ever let her teenaged daughter walk through town alone. Lilly narrowed her eyes. She'd already gone way over the line; there was no reason to stop now. "I've got my mom's car, I'll drive her home."</p>
<p>"I've always wanted to ride in an SUV," said Miley wistfully from her position against Lilly's shoulder, as if an SUV were something to be revered.</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't help but snort at the comment, turning her eyes to the woman across from her. "See, she's delirious."</p>
<p>Miley's mom cracked another half-smile. "No, she's just being Miley." She sighed heavily. "Alright, you can drive her home, but I want you to leave right after. And Miley, you make sure you lock all the doors, alright, hun?"</p>
<p>Lilly frowned, but nodded nevertheless. This town seemed to be full of crazy, rude people and she couldn't figure out why. Except for Miley, of course, she thought. Miley was crazy in an endearing way. Lilly nudged her until she sat up, eyes bleary.</p>
<p>"Come on, road kill, I'm taking you home," said Lilly lightly and despite how sick she was, Miley seemed very excited by the prospect of a ride in the SUV. They got up and Lilly was already halfway to the door when she realized Miley wasn't behind her. She turned, only to see Miley in her mother's arms. The woman kissed the top of her daughter's head, before letting her follow Lilly.</p>
<p>Lilly took Miley's hand to lead her to the car, trying not to let the confusion show on her face. Miley's mom was obviously incredibly strict and controlling, to the point where Lilly would surely have hated her had it been her own mom, but in the blink of an eye she was lovingly hugging her sick daughter. Lilly did not understand and she wondered if whatever truth she had yet to find about Miley and the townspeople would shed light on her family, as well. She tried to figure out the mystery on the drive to Miley's place, but was too busy keeping the girl from fiddling with everything to even manage a clear thought.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"Miley, <b>what</b> are you doing?" yelled Lilly, almost panicking. She'd finally gotten the stubborn brunette into the house and to her room, despite Miley's insistence she should check on the chickens or climb the large tree outside. Lilly wanted to make sure the girl got into bed okay before she left, but now Miley was taking her clothes off.</p>
<p>"I can't get into my clean bed with smelly diner clothes on," said Miley, as if it were the most logical thing in the world.</p>
<p>Lilly was sitting on the edge of the bed, having a nervous meltdown. The sweatshirt and t-shirt were already gone and Miley was fumbling with the buttons on her jeans. Lilly wanted nothing more than to let her eyes wander across her friend's body, but it was wrong and she turned her head. No progress seemed to be made after several minutes and Lilly risked a glance. Lilly stood in shock, stepping up to Miley.</p>
<p>Bruises and small scars covered Miley's torso, all in different stages of healing. She seemed unconcerned at Lilly's proximity and the hand lightly tracing one of the bruises on her shoulder blade. Miley finally managed to undo her buttons and grinned triumphantly. She pulled her pants off, despite Lilly being right next to her, and tugged on some sweatpants. But Lilly only had eyes for the bruises and dread pooled in her stomach.</p>
<p>"Miley, how'd you get all those bruises?" asked Lilly softly and Miley looked at her weirdly.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, glancing down at herself as if she'd forgotten they were even there. "I have no idea. Well, this one," she pointed at her shoulder, "I'm pretty sure was when I fell off that tree." She pointed at another one. "And that was probably when I jumped from the hayloft. Momma always says I'm not careful enough. She's always gotta patch me up…I don't think it's that bad."</p>
<p>Miley sounded so blasé about it and Lilly really wanted to believe her, but she couldn't help but be worried. Then Miley turned to grab a clean sweater and Lilly actually gasped when she saw her back. It was like nothing she had ever seen before.</p>
<p>The lines were faint, but visible against the girl's tanned skin. It looked like the roots of a tree; a thick line stretched from the right side of Miley's lower back, across her spine and upwards, branching out into more lines along the way that got smaller and thinner the more they split, like an array of blood vessels painted on her skin. Lilly almost reached out a hand to touch the skin, but Miley turned back around and pulled her sweater on. She saw the strange look on Lilly's face and frowned.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Lilly closed her mouth, realizing she probably looked ridiculous. "What <b>is</b> that…on your back?"</p>
<p>Miley looked confused for a moment then grinned, "I ate an acorn when I was little…"</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes, but then remembered why she was even here. Miley still looked awful and Lilly gently pushed her onto the bed. Miley flashed her trademark grin and climbed under the covers. She wrapped them tightly around herself, shivering, but then sat up.</p>
<p>"Will you stay with me?" Her voice sounded so hopeful, Lilly didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>"I can't. Don't you remember what your mom said?"</p>
<p>Miley scrunched up her face. "No. Please, Lilly? She won't even notice."</p>
<p>Lilly sighed, knowing she might as well give in because there was no way she was leaving that totally adorable, pleading girl in bed alone. Miley obviously knew she'd won and pulled the covers back with a grin. Lilly kicked off her shoes and climbed in next to Miley, suddenly nervous about being in bed with a girl she hardly knew. Miley, having no such inhibitions, curled herself around Lilly, bedding her head on Lilly's shoulder.</p>
<p>Miley was soft, yet firm and so incredibly warm Lilly immediately felt sleepy. Her arm wrapped around the girl's shoulders subconsciously, but she couldn't deny that it felt so good to hold Miley. Her eyes drifted around the room, noticing the two picture frames on the desk for the first time. The first picture was of a man with long, dirty blonde hair, wearing a cowboy hat. He looked a lot like Miley and Lilly felt a pang. The second picture was of a blonde boy, making a goofy face. Lilly tightened her hold. She was going to lie here and hold Miley until she fell asleep and then she'd leave. Lilly didn't want Miley to get into even more trouble and she honestly didn't want another encounter with the girl's mom. But after a few minutes she, too, was fast asleep.</p>
<p>Lilly heard voices and sleepily blinked her eyes open. It was dark and it took her several moments to realize where she was. She almost jumped out of bed when she did, but Miley was still snuggled into her side, sleeping peacefully. They'd left the bedroom door open and she could see the light from the living room. Lilly's heart thundered. There was no way for her to escape now and chances were Miley's mom had seen her SUV outside anyway. She was doomed. The front door shut and she heard the voices again, quite clearly now. Lilly held her breath, knowing she shouldn't listen in, but she had no idea what else to do.</p>
<p>"…but Susan, surely you don't think it's <b>that</b> bad," said the woman Lilly suspected to be the grandmother.</p>
<p>"Mom, I said I was done talkin' about this. I'm not lettin' my little girl go through that again," said Miley's mom, clearly upset.</p>
<p>The older woman sighed,."Be reasonable, honey. Miley's got a mind of her own and what a mind it is. Did you know, when she snuck into town last week she went to George's store? The girl just won't listen."</p>
<p>"I know she did, no less than three people thought fit to mention it to me. If they had their way, she'd never leave the house. I'm telling you ma, this town is on the verge of a witch hunt."</p>
<p>The other woman made a clicking noise with her tongue. "Don't say things like that. Miley will be fine. Maybe having a little friend will keep her out of trouble."</p>
<p>Susan did not sound convinced. "Maybe her little friend <b>is</b> trouble. You remember that boy? Jake Ryan…that good for nothing little…"</p>
<p>"Hush now, just let it be. Now, go check on Miley." The older woman interrupted her and the voices stopped.</p>
<p>Lilly heard footsteps and before she had a chance to react, Miley's mom stood in the doorway, flicking a light switch in the hallway. She stared at the two girls, Miley snuggled against Lilly's side, her face expressionless. Lilly tried to think of something to say, to explain why she had defied instructions, but the woman beat her to it.</p>
<p>"How is she doing?"</p>
<p>"I uh…she's been sleeping. She doesn't feel as hot though."</p>
<p>Susan nodded, trying to keep her mother's words in mind as she looked at the two. Lilly shifted uncomfortably under her gaze and Miley awoke with her movement. She briefly lifted her head, smiling as she saw her mother in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Hi momma. I got to ride in Lilly's SUV; it's nice. Lilly's nice, too," said Miley simply, not even bothering to move and Lilly flushed bright red.</p>
<p>Susan smiled softly. "Okay, honey." She looked at Lilly, face unreadable. "Are you staying for dinner, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Lilly was at a loss for words. Did the woman hate her or not? It was impossible to tell and she figured being difficult must be a family trait. Her stomach growled loudly and she realized she'd never actually gotten her food from the diner. She was starving.</p>
<p>"I'll take that as a 'yes'. Half an hour," said Susan and turned around. Lilly leaned her head back against the headboard with a groan. She still had no idea what was going on and all the semi-information she kept getting only served to make her more curious. She thought to the conversation she had overheard and one thing in particular stood out – "this town is ready for a witch hunt". What could Miley possibly have done?</p>
