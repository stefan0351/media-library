<!-- Secret Desires \ Part 3 -->

<p>Brooke stood in the kitchen eating her snack and thinking
			about how odd Sam and Lily were just acting. (Well, more odd than
			usual) she giggled to herself. Then her thoughts drifted to more
			thoughts of Sam. Lately, it seemed that her thoughts had been
			constantly cluttered with the beautiful brunette. She couldn't get
			Sam out her head and it was driving her crazy. </p>
		<p>Sighing heavily, she cleaned her mess and went to check in
			on her sleeping baby sister. Tip toeing in and gazing down at the
			peacefully sleeping tiny bundle she couldn't help but smile. Then she
			whispered to the child.</p>
		<p>"You are so beautiful.  Just like your sister Sammy."  She
			reached down and caressed the little fuzzy head lightly. "What am I
			going to do, Mac? Hmmm? Do you have any advice for your big sis?"
			She let out a small low groan. " I know what you would say if you
			could talk, 'There is no help for you, Brooke,'" she finished with a
			low laugh. Straightening up, she blew Mac a kiss and went to her room
			to get some homework done.</p>
		<p>Sam drove around for a little while just thinking. Now on
			her way back home, she wanted to distract herself from her never
			ending thoughts of Brooke so she turned on the radio to see what was
			playing. The first song she heard was "You Got It Bad"  by Usher and
			she let out a humorous snort.</p>
		<p>"Yeah I know I do. I don't need the reminder," she said as she
			quickly changed the station, next she heard.</p>
		<p align="center">"Have you ever loved somebody so much
			<br>
			It makes you cry
			<br>
			Have you ever needed something so bad
			<br>
			You can't sleep at night
			<br>

			<br>
			But they don't come out right
			<br>
			Have you ever, have you ever
			<br>
			Have you ever been in love
			<br>
			Been in love so bad
			<br>
			You'd do anything to make them understand
			<br>
			Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
			<br>
			You'd give anything up to make them feel the same
			<br>
			Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
			<br>
			But you don't know what to say
			<br>
			And you don't know where to start
			<br>
			Have you ever loved somebody so much

			<br>
			Have you ever needed something so bad
			<br>
			You can't sleep at night
			<br>

			<br>
			But they don't come out right
			<br>
			Have you ever, have you ever
			<br>
			Have you ever found the one
			<br>
			You've dreamed of all your life
			<br>
			You'd do just about anything to look into their eyes
			<br>
			Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to
		</p>
		<p align="center">Only to find that one won't give their heart to you
			<br>
			Have you ever closed your eyes and
			<br>
			Dreamed that they were there
			<br>
			And all you can do is wait for that day when they will care
			<br>
			Have you ever loved somebody so much
			<br>
			It makes you cry
			<br>
			Have you ever needed something so bad
			<br>
			You can't sleep at night
			<br>
			Have you ever tried to find the words
			<br>
			But they don't come out right
			<br>
			Have you ever, have you ever
			<br>
			What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby
			<br>
			What do I gotta say to get to your heart
			<br>
			To make you understand how I need you next to me
			<br>
			Gotta get you in my world
			<br>
			'Cuz baby I can't sleep
			<br>
			Have you ever loved somebody so much
			<br>
			It's makes you cry
			<br>
			Have you ever needed something so bad
			<br>
			You can't sleep at night
			<br>
			Have you ever tried to find the words
			<br>
			But they don't come out right
			<br>
			Have you ever, have you ever"
		</p>
		<p>She knew she should have changed it but just couldn't bring
			herself to.</p>
		<p>"Nothing like torturing yourself," she said as she turned the
			radio off and drove into the driveway. She got out of the car and
			went into the house. </p>
		<p>Almost to her room she decided to check on Mac. Walking into
			the quiet room, she looked down at the precious child. She smiled
			down at Mac and whispered.</p>
		<p>"Well, Mac it's official, I am a product of unrequited love."
			She sighed heavily. "What should I do?" she asked. "Yeah, yeah I
			know. 'What you are thinking?  Give it up, McPherson.'" She stared
			off for a minute. "I wish I could."  With that, she kissed her
			fingers then lightly rubbed Mac's little head.</p>
		<p>"Goodnight sweet heart." She went to her room and climbed in to
			bed thinking that tomorrow she was going to work on getting over her
			soon to be stepsister. She just had to find a distraction. She
			drifted off to sleep with Brooke on her mind, as usual, not knowing
			what tomorrow had in store for her.  She had no idea that things were
			about to get interesting.</p>
		<p>Brooke decided to try and sleep so she closed her schoolbooks,
			turned the light off and climbed into bed. Tossing and turning, she
			let out a heavy sigh. She  had finally settled on her back when she
			heard her door open. Lifting up slightly so she was leaning on her
			elbows, she saw a figure standing in the shadows. </p>
		<p>"Sam?" she asked as she saw the figure take a step closer.</p>
		<p>"It's me, Brooke, I can't sleep. I need to talk to you,"
			she heard Sam's low voice say.  But there was something different in
			the tone.  It was almost sensual and it sent tingling chills through
			her, instantly making her nipples hard. </p>
		<p>Brooke tried to reply but it came out sounding more like a
			squeak. Clearing her throat she tried again.</p>
		<p>"What about? Are you all right?" For some reason her body was
			starting to crave to be touched. It craved Sam's touch.  With that
			realization, she started to tremble.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I am definitely all right, Brooke. In fact, more than
			all right. I finally realized what I want," Sam's voice seemed to get
			deeper with every word. "What I need," she finished as she stepped
			out of the shadows into the pale moonlight streaming in through the
			window.</p>
		<p>Brooke gasped at Sam's beauty. There Sam stood, her white silk
			bra and panties visible by her open robe. Barely able to speak past
			the lump in her throat, Brooke whispered.</p>
		<p>"What do you want?"  She took a deep breath. "What do you need,
			Sammy?" </p>
		<p>Sam walked over to the bed looking into Brooke's eyes and
			let the robe fall from her shoulders to pool on the floor. She
			climbed up Brooke's body.  Now resting on her hands and knees, she
			leaned in slightly until her lips hovered over Brooke's and their now
			labored breaths mingled. </p>
		<p>"You, Brooke. I want and need you." She swooped down and took the
			blonde's lips in a slow passionate kiss. Brooke moaned as she felt
			Sam's tongue kneading her bottom lip. The kiss lasted long as they
			explored each other's mouths. Just as Brooke was about to roll them
			over Sam pulled back and whispered.</p>
		<p>"It's time." Brooke was confused.</p>
		<p>"Time for what?" she asked. Sam just smiled. </p>
		<p>"To wake up." And suddenly Brooke's hazy mind finally started
			waking as she heard the ringing of her alarm.  She slammed her hand
			down to turn it off and sat up. Wiping her sleepy eyes, she looked
			toward the bathroom when she heard the unmistakable sound of a shower
			running. Instantly fully awake, visions of a naked Sam with water
			running down her body, her head tilted back as she washed her hair,
			her hands gliding over her firm body to wash herself ran through
			Brooke's mind. Shaking her head with a groan, she flopped back down
			on her bed, throwing her blanket over head.</p>
		<p>"Oh God! I am in so much trouble here!" </p>
