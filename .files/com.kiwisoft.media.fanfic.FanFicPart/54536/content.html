<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Tangled Web -->

<p>A week passed since that disasterous but oh so eventful
breakfast and things were not progressing well. While Sam and Brooke were fine,
if a little awkward around each other, Lily was downright hostile to both of
them. Poor Sam was clueless and Brooke was guilt ridden. And she was no closer
to telling Sam the truth or figuring it out for herself than she was when the
whole mess started. </p>
<p>Her dreams were changing, becoming more vivid. She wasn't sure
if that was a good thing or not. But she enjoyed it nonetheless. Every night she
made doubly sure that her bedroom doors were locked so that Sam wouldn't hear
anything should she accidently make any noise. Every night she dreamt of Sam.
Every morning she came close to telling Sam. And every morning she chickened
out. She'd stare at herself in the mirror and not believe that the face staring
back at her could possibly be gay. And then the images from her dreams would
flash through her mind's eye and well, there was only so much denial the brain
could manage before it told you to go screw yourself and wake up and smell the
coffee. Right about now, Brooke's brain was on Hazelnut. </p>
<p>(I think, Brooke, that you're going to have to face the fact
that you're gay) she told her mirror image one Thursday morning. Her image
stared back at her blankly. (Yeah, I can see that you're shocked by that) she
thought sarcastically. Her image blinked. (Oh, you're a lot of help) She sighed.
(I'm gay AND insane, what a wonderful package) </p>
<p>"Staring at it isn't going to make it get any less ugly," Sam
said from the doorway. Brooke turned and shot her a mock glare. Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"Har har, Sam, very funny," Brooke said peevishly although she
wasn't really upset. "I was thinking." Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I could see the smoke coming out of your ears," she
pointed out. Brooke sent her a real glare and she put her hands up in surrender.
"Truce, truce!" she pleaded. Brooke nodded. "Seriously, it looked pretty
important. Anything I can help with?" Brooke regarded Sam strangely for a
moment. Was Sam McPherson, former enemy and current object of her lustful
affections, (which thankfully Sam was unaware of), actually offering to help
her? </p>
<p>"Why would you want to help me?" Brooke asked doubtfully. Sam
looked away hurt. </p>
<p>"Ow, where'd that come from? I thought we'd gotten past the
bitch-on-bitch phase of our relationship. I realize we're not exactly friends
but whatever you'd call us now, I thought we could at least help each other out
once in a while," Sam explained while her eyes darted around the room nervously.
She was afraid she'd overstepped her bounds. Brooke mentally gave herself one
Hell of a beating. </p>
<p>(Sure, Brooke, she reaches out to help and you beat her over
the head with a lead pipe. How nice of you) Brooke told herself sarcastically.
She eyed the skittish brunette in the room with her. (How do you do it, Sam? If
you feel the same way I do in your presence, how do you hide it so well? Just
looking at you is making my heart race and my skin itch with the need to touch
you. And you look so calm! It's not fair!) </p>
<p>"God, Sam, I'm sorry," she apologized. "And we are friends, or
close to it." Sam's face lit up and Brooke smiled at her. "It was just strange
given our `wonderful'," the word dripped with sarcasm, "history that you would
offer to help me." </p>
<p>"Well, I've noticed something bothering you lately and I'd
like to help," Sam said. (I wish you could, Sam, but I'm not ready for that just
yet) Brooke lamented. </p>
<p>"It's nothing, Sam," she lied. "But if I do decided to talk
about it, you're the first person I'll go to." (:::hysterical internal
giggle:::) </p>
<p>"OK, cool," Sam responded with a satisfied half-smile. Her
expression turned serious. "Not to change subjects, but what is up with Lily
lately? It's like she's been possessed by some sort of HellSpawn. I mean, I'm
beginning to prefer Nic's company to Lily's, no offense." Brooke nodded.
</p>
<p>"None taken, I know what you mean," she agreed. Sam eyed her
suspiciously. </p>
<p>"What happened in the bathroom that day? Because that's when
her attitude dove into the toliet, excuse the pun. She came out of there pissed
like I've never seen before and while I'm not blaming you, something obviously
happened but neither of you are talking." Brooke looked away and shrugged, not
ready to divuldge that discussion to Sam. </p>
<p>((("You have no idea what's within your grasp and even if you
did you lack the courage to reach out for it!" Lily accused bitterly.
</p>
<p>"What's `within my grasp', Lily?" Brooke growled at her. </p>
<p>"I'm not handing it to you that easily, Brooke," she growled
back. "But it's something more special than you deserve and for the life of me I
don't understand why you're going to get it, why it wants you!" </p>
<p>"What are you talking about? What is `it'?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"If you can't figure that out on your own, you don't deserve
it," Lily had informed Brooke hotly and arrogantly. "But first, you need to
figure out what it is you want, Brooke. You need to decide what's more
important, your precious image or what you want, your own happiness and someone
else's."))) </p>
<p>Those words didn't haunt Brooke as bad as the way the
conversation had actually ended. </p>
<p>((("I know what I want and I can't have it BECAUSE OF YOU!"
Lily had screamed her voice full of raw and pure pain. </p>
<p>"Lily, I." Brooke started but Lily cut her off. </p>
<p>"I'm not stupid, Brooke. And neither are you so cut the shit.
We both know what I'm talking about," Lily took a deep, calming breath. "Now,
figure out what you want, what you are, what you can and can not deal with and
then let the rest of us know so that we can move on with the rest of our lives." </p>
<p>"I've seen how you look at `it'," Lily continued, unwilling to
give Brooke the satisfaction of saying Sam's name outloud. "You may not realize
what you want yet, but you'd better figure it out soon. I won't sit by passively
for long. I'm not known for my passiveness," she reminded the thunderstruck
blonde. </p>
<p>"Lily, I don't know what I want," Brooke admitted softly. Lily
sighed. </p>
<p>"I know, that's the problem. You have to figure that out. It's
not fair to make us wait for you to iron out your `issues'." </p>
<p>"I'm scared," Brooke whispered. </p>
<p>"Grow up," Lily rumbled roughly. "And grab on to the
possiblities that lay in front of you before they slip through your fingers,
Brooke. Because I won't make the same mistake and there are no second chances in
this life." Lily opened the door and walked out.))) </p>
<p>And Brooke knew that there was only so long Lily would stand
by and wait for her to make up her mind. Lily was not by nature passive, she saw
something she felt needed to be done and she did it. There was no reason to
think that this whole `Sam' thing would be any different. Lily loved Sam and
Brooke was beginning to think she did too but wasn't sure if she was strong
enough to handle the ramifications if that was true. She was telling the truth
when she told Lily she was scared. She pulled her mind back to the here and now
and saw Sam smiling at her. Sam waved. </p>
<p>"Hi! Have a nice mental vacation?" Sam asked cheekily. Brooke
blushed. </p>
<p>"Zoned out, did I?" Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Oh yeah, big time. Totally different planet for a few seconds
there." </p>
<p>"Sorry," Brooke sighed. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Eh. Are you going to answer my question? What did you two
rumble about anyway? And don't lie and say nothing because I'm not stupid."
Panic flashed through Brooke. (Oh crap, how do I get out of this one?)
</p>
<p>"Uh, we argued about Mary Cherry and her affinity for fur,"
Brooke lied lamely. Sam glared at her. </p>
<p>"I just said I wasn't stupid. Fine, suit yourself if you don't
want to tell me, I won't push. It's obviously an issue between the two of you,
but for the love of God, iron whatever it is out before the rest of us get
caught in the cross fire," Sam asked as she left the bathroom. She was slightly
insulted that Brooke had looked her in the face and blatantly lied to her. </p>
<p>She shut the door to her bedroom and leaned against it
heavily. (There is so much more going on here than I'm aware of, I just know it)
Sam thought. (It all comes back down to what went on in that bathroom) She knew
this but neither girl was talking. You couldn't even mention Brooke's name
around Lily without the shorter girl going postal and flipping her lid. (When
did my life get so complicated?) Sam wondered. She smiled humorlessly. (Oh,
yeah, when I fell madly and completely in love with my stepsister-to-be) she
turned around and rested her forehead on the door. (Somebody shoot me and put me
out of my misery) she begged the cosmic masses. They weren't listening.
</p>
<p>She ran her fingers over the contours of the door that now
separated her from Brooke and sighed. (God, I wish I could tell you, Brooke) she
thought as a few tears slid down her face at the hopelessness of her situation.
(I am so hopelessly yours and it's slowly killing me not be able to touch you or
tell you how I feel) a small sob escaped her lips and she bit her bottom lip to
prevent anymore. She turned around again and slid to the floor, bringing her
knees up to her chest and wrapping her arms around them. Curled up in a ball on
her bedroom floor, Sam silently cried for what she felt she could never have and
for what was kept from her by more than the three inches of wood between them </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke lay sprawled on her back on her bed contemplating the
great mysteries of life, or at least HER life when her phone rang. Expecting it
to be Nicole or Mary Cherry, she attempted to ignore it but after rolling over
to check the Caller ID, she was surprised to see ESPOSITO on it. Warily, she
picked up the phone. </p>
<p>"Hello?" she said softly. There was a pause that made her
think that maybe Lily had changed her mind. </p>
<p>"Figure anything out yet?" Lily finally asked, the venom in
her voice carrying over clearly. Brooke winced. </p>
<p>"I think so," Brooke answered carefully. She heard Lily sigh. </p>
<p>"I lost didn't I?" Lily asked, her voice softer this time,
resigned. </p>
<p>"Lily, this wasn't a game to be played, with winners or
losers," Brooke pointed out. Lily sighed again. </p>
<p>"Why couldn't you be straight like a normal person?" Lily
asked almost desperately. Brooke couldn't help laughing a little. </p>
<p>"I'm trying to figure that out myself, Lily," she said between
giggles. </p>
<p>"It's not fair," Lily complained morosely. "You always win."
Brooke frowned even though Lily couldn't see her. </p>
<p>"It's not about winning," she repeated. "Sam isn't the prize
in a box of CrackerJacks, Lily." Lily laughed although it sounded more like a
sob. </p>
<p>"I know, she's much better than a stick on tattoo," she joked.
"How'd you know?" Brooke smacked herself in the forehead at her slip. She just
let Lily know she knew about her and Sam. (Shit, might as well come clean) </p>
<p>"I accidently overheard you and Sam talking in the newspaper
office that day," she confessed. There was dead silence on the other end of the
phone and for a moment she thought Lily hung up. "Lily?" </p>
<p>"You've known that long how she felt and you didn't say
anything?" indignation crept into Lily's tone and Brooke was suddenly sorry she
said anything. </p>
<p>"Lily, what could I say until I figured out how I felt?"
Brooke argued. "Even now I don't know what I'm going to do." </p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, you really are a blonde, aren't you?" Lily
snapped. Brooke glared at the phone. </p>
<p>"That's not fair, Lily. This is one Hell of a hot potato to
drop in someone's lap and expect them to react to. I've still got some sorting
out to do. I've taken the first step, give me some credit," she countered. </p>
<p>"Say it," Lily demanded. </p>
<p>"What?" Brooke asked confused. </p>
<p>"Say the words and I'll back off," Lily explained. Brooke
sighed with the realization. </p>
<p>"Fine, geez, didn't realize you could be so childish," she
growled. </p>
<p>"Brooke, either say it or I'm going after Sam myself, no holds
barred," Lily warned. Ice cold fear shot through Brooke. (Oh no you don't you
little twerp) she thought. </p>
<p>"Fine, Lily. I'm gay and I love Sam. Happy?" (Oh, shit, did I
just admit that outloud?) Again there was absolute silence on the other end of
the phone. Soon though, Brooke could hear sobbing. "Oh. Lily, please stop
crying," she begged. There was a long sniffle. </p>
<p>"S'Ok Brooke," Lily assured her. "Just hearing it was hard. I
mean, I knew that as long as Sam loved you I didn't stand a chance. I just
figured that eventually she'd get tired of waiting for you, you being straight
and all, and I could wait for her. You being gay AND in love with Sam kinda
destroys that plan," Lily explained through her tears. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Brooke offered. </p>
<p>"Don't be. How are you going to tell her?" </p>
<p>"God, I don't know. I've still got a lot of stuff to figure
out, Lily. If I go through with this, it changes so much. My entire life, my
image," Brooke explained, mildly panicked. </p>
<p>"Oh for God's sake, Brooke," Lily snapped, anger returning to
her voice. "If you can't get over your stupid little image issues than you don't
deserve Sam. And you will lose her because you know she doesn't give a rat's ass
about any of that. But if you cling to worrying about what other people think,
you'll lose her. I won't make the same mistake." </p>
<p>"I'm not you, Lily," Brooke snapped back. "Or Sam. I don't
have that kind of strength." </p>
<p>"You'd better find it, Brooke. And fast. There's more to life
than people's opinions, it's called personal happiness. And yours, much to my
chagrin, comes with the name Sam." Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm working on it, Lily," she said confidently. She really
was, she just didn't know exactly what she was doing yet. </p>
<p>"OK, I'll let you go `work on it' then. Just don't play with
her, Brooke. Cause I'll kill you if you hurt her," Lily warned. </p>
<p>"Understood," Brooke answered. </p>
<p>"Goodnight, Brooke." </p>
<p>"Goodnight, Lily." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke was brushing her teeth and getting ready for bed when
Sam walked into the bathroom. She grabbed her toothbrush and gave Brooke a small
smile. </p>
<p>"Who called? Nic want to know what you were wearing to school
tomorrow so you could match?" she teased. Brooke stuck out her tongue.
</p>
<p>"Actually, little Miss I-think-I'm-so-funny, it was Lily,"
Brooke informed her. Sam's eyebrows shot up in surprise. </p>
<p>"Really? She want to go for round 2 or straighten things out
with you?" </p>
<p>"A little of both but I think we're OK now," Brooke answered.
Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"That's good. Things were getting WAY out of hand. I was
starting to feel seriously unincluded." Brooke watched as Sam started to brush
her teeth. She felt her body temperature start to rise and her skin tingle. (Oh,
I have got it bad) she thought with a rueful laugh. </p>
<p>"I'd never not include you, Sammy," Brooke said, noticing how
her voice seemed to unintentionally dip an octave. Sam noticed it too and
frowned into the mirror in confusion. </p>
<p>"Uh, that's good," Sam stuttered nervously around a mouthful
of toothpaste. The change in the cheerleaders voice made her blush and she
wasn't sure why. "So what was the argument about anyway? Can I know now?" she
asked trying to draw attention away from the sudden tension in the air. (OK, I'm
clueless again. I think I might need a script to keep up with things lately) </p>
<p>"We both wanted something, the same thing only I didn't
realize it at first," Brooke said cryptically, moving a little closer to Sam.
Sam eyed her warily. She loved being around Brooke but something in Brooke's
behavior right now was setting off alarm bells in her head. And yet, most of her
really didn't want to listen to them. </p>
<p>Brooke, for her part, had come to a few conclusions after
hanging up the phone. The most important being, Lily was right, her happiness
was paramount. She could deal with whatever else second. She wanted Sam, that
would make her happy and she already knew Sam wanted her. Now she just had to
muster the courage to let Sam know. Unfortunately, knowing this and acting on it
were two different things. And Sam's present Bambi caught in the headlights
imitation wasn't helping. </p>
<p>"What did you both want?" Sam asked slightly confused. Lily
and Brooke didn't wear the same size, so it wasn't clothes, not to mention they
had different taste. It certainly wasn't a guy, because Lily wanted Sam herself.
But if it was that then that would mean. </p>
<p>Brooke watched Sam's eyes grow so wide she thought they were
going to pop out of Sam's head and she knew Sam had figured it out on her own.
Sam looked at her in shock and started to shake. Brooke took another step
forward and was surprised when Sam took a step back. </p>
<p>"Sam." Brooke started. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Don't play with me, it's not fair," she whispered. Brooke
crossed the space between them and deciding that words would fail her, pulled
Sam into a scorching kiss. (Hmm.AquaFresh) Brooke thought absently. Sam made no
effort to pull away but instead surrendered to the kiss. Brooke finally broke
away and leaned her forehead against Sam's, panting heavily. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked quietly but Brooke covered her mouth with
her hand. </p>
<p>"No questions tonight, Sam," she said as softly as Sam had
said her name. "We'll talk tomorrow, I promise." She kissed Sam again and then
after giving Sam a loving smile, retreated into her room. Sam stood in the
bathroom, shocked for several minutes before she remembered where her bedroom
was. When she reached her bed, she collapsed onto it and cried herself to sleep. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Meanwhile, Lily decided she needed chocolate so she walked to
the corner store. She hated walking at night but her mother had her car so she
had no choice. She was on her way home when a familiar and unwelcome car pulled
up beside her. </p>
<p>"Heya, Twinkie, whatcha doing walking this late at night?
Earning extra cash?" Nicole asked. Lily rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Go away Nicole. I'm not at school therefore I don't have to
put up with you." </p>
<p>"OK, the prostitution crack was out of line, Lil, sorry," the
apology stopped Lily in her tracks. (Did Nicole Julian just apologize to me?)
She did a double take to make sure it was indeed Nicole Julian driving the
expensive luxury car. (Yup, that's Nic) </p>
<p>"What do you want, Nic? I'm not really in the mood for your
unique brand of company," she warned. Nicole shrugged. </p>
<p>"Look, I just wanted to offer you a ride home, that's all,"
Nicole explained. Lily stared at her like she'd sprouted an extra head.
</p>
<p>"Excuse me? And what do you get out of it?" Nicole frowned. </p>
<p>"Nothing. Lily, it's late and dangerous for someone like you
to be out walking alone," Nicole said softly. Lily scoffed. </p>
<p>"Someone like me? What? Latina trash?" Nicole sighed.
</p>
<p>"No, a pretty young girl. Jesus, Lily, hang a sign on your
back that says `rape me' for God's sake, you'd be less obvious," Nic snapped. In
Lily's opinion, Nicole had just sprouted two more heads. (Pretty?) </p>
<p>"Uh." Lily stuttered. </p>
<p>"Taking articulation lessons from Spam, I see?" Nic joked.
"Are you getting in the car or not?" Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"Ok, you have a point, Nicole. I'll give you that," she
climbed into the passenger's seat. Nicole pulled the car back on the road. </p>
<p>"Great, but if you tell ANYONE at school I let you in my car,
loser, I'll skin you alive." </p>
