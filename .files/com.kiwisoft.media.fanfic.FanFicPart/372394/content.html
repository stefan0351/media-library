<P><B>Title: </B>I Want You To Want Me</P><P><B>Author: </B>Clana2009</P><P><B>Disclaimer:  I don't own John Tucker Must Die. And I certainly don't own Kate and Beth but if I did, they would be together cause they are a perfect couple!</B></P><P><B>An:  </B>This is my first story on and my first time writing Kate and Beth. I hope I got their characters close to how they should be. Feedback is greatly appreciated. I am a firm believer in constructive criticism so let me know if something seems wrong to you.</P><P>I want you to want me. I need you to need me. These are the words that always come to my mind when I see her. She may have a lot of flaws, but to me she is simply perfect. I get tingles just thinking about how she dresses. Always in high boots, a short skirt, and a tank top that shows off all of her smooth skin. What I wouldn't give to run my fingers through her beautiful chestnut hair.</P><P>Stop it Kate, you're drooling! I hope no one saw me staring at her for the past ten minutes. Oh god, I can tell by the smirk she is sending me that she caught me. I blush a deep shade of red and avert my eyes but I know that only makes her grin widen. Why does she have to be so desirable?</P><P>Oh no, she's coming this way….be cool Kate.</P><P>"You know Kate, if you want to stare at me I can give you something to stare at." She winks at me when she says this and I think she just gave me a heart attack. My blush deepens and I try and think of something to say.</P><P>"I uh…..um…..I'm sorry" I curse myself for stuttering because I know it only fuels her.</P><P>"You don't have to apologize for thinking I'm hot. I'm actually very flattered."</P><P>Whoa! Is she flirting with me or just messing with my head? Oh god….why is she leaning towards me. I can't think straight when she's this close to me. It's times like these when all I can think about is the kiss we shared in John's truck.</P><P>I can feel her breath on my lips. "You really have no idea how sexy you are.  All you have to do is stutter like that or stare at me, and successfully turn me on."</P><P>Holy shit!  Did the temperature just raise because I'm suddenly extremely hot!  "I ah…Beth, what are you doing?" She smiles at me and out of nowhere I can't breath.</P><P>"I'm trying to tell you that I see the way you look at me and I could tell by the way you kissed me, that you want me. All I'm doing is telling you that I want you just as much as you want me." Oh My God! What do you say to that?</P><P>Before I can come up with anything to say, I feel her lips press against mine.  There are no words to describe how I feel right now….I honestly think I'm flying. The kiss is sweet and gentle but I can't help but moan when I feel her tongue on my bottom lip. I open my mouth willingly and I thank god that I did because she tastes amazing.  It's like a mix of chocolate and Beth. Mmm, definitely my new favorite flavor. Our tongues are dueling for dominance and it's no surprise that Beth wins.</P><P>I regretfully break apart for much needed oxygen. I'm breathing heavily and when I open my eyes I'm greeted with the most beautiful sight in the world. Beth's eyes are clouded with desire, she's flushed, and her mouth is slightly open. With the look she's giving me, I'm tempted to kiss her again but I restrain myself.</P><P>Beth finally breaks the silence, "Wow."</P><P>I have to smile, "Yeah. Wow."</P><P>No more words are needed because Beth is leading me out of the school and into our lives together. Neither of us know what might happen in the future but one thing is for sure. I got my wish, because now I know for sure that Beth wants me and she needs me!</P><P>An: How was it? Good? Bad? Anyways if it is at least okay, then I am either thinking about continuing this or just making a series of one shots….tell me what you think. Thank you!</P>
