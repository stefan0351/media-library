<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Seventeen -->

<p>Brooke woke to find herself pressed tightly against Sam's back. Sometime while they slept, exhausted after making love throughout the morning and afternoon, they'd ended up spooned together. She sighed happily as she nuzzled the nape of Sam's neck and let the brunette's unruly hair tickle her nose and face. She rested her hand on Sam's bare hip, slowly stroking the smooth skin with her fingertips. She loved the way Sam felt to her. She was so strong and yet so fragile and Brooke found herself captivated by the contradiction.</p>
<p>"Mmmm...good morning," Sam's voice floated back to her still slightly groggy.</p>
<p>"Evening is more accurate," Brooke giggled. "We slept the afternoon away and missed school. It's almost 8."</p>
<p>"We must have been tired," Sam joked as she rolled over to face Brooke. The look of utter peace and contentment that rolled through Sam's chocolate eyes stole Brooke's breath away. Since waking up from her coma and meeting Sam, Brooke always noticed a haunted look to Sam's eyes. But for the moment it seemed to be gone. And Sam was even more beautiful to Brooke in that moment. Brooke didn't even think that was possible, but she was.</p>
<p>"God, you're beautiful," she gasped making Sam blush.</p>
<p>"So are you," Sam said back to the blonde, kissing her soundly. Brooke smiled and pressed her hands against Sam's chest, feeling the comforting warmth of Sam's skin and the heartbeat beneath her palms. She leaned in and kissed Sam's chest in the hollow where her collarbones met. She felt Sam shudder.</p>
<p>"Brooke," Sam groaned as she ran her hands through the silky blonde hair in front of her.</p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke answered in the same husky voice. She could feel herself coming alive again as Sam returned her touches. She wanted the brunette again, needed her really. Brooke doubted that she'd ever get enough of her no matter how long she lived.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I think we should talk," Sam gasped as Brooke settled at her breasts, lightly sucking and nipping at them. It was getting hard to concentrate as Brooke worked her body diligently.</p>
<p>"'bout what?" Brooke asked before replacing her mouth around Sam's left nipple and biting down with a twist that made Sam whine from the back of her throat. Brooke really had no interest in talking as much as moaning and screaming.</p>
<p>"This...us...Oh God," Sam tried to explain but failed miserably as Brooke's hands wandered lower. The blood supply to Sam's brain was quickly draining to other parts of her anatomy.</p>
<p>"Do you REALLY wanna talk right now?" Brooke teased throatily.</p>
<p>"Noooooo..." Sam moaned. "I mean, yes!" she corrected herself. "Yes, we need to talk." Brooke sighed and sat up a bit to look into Sam's flushed face.</p>
<p>"OK, talk. But make it quick, I've got plaaaaaaaaaaaans," she said drawing out the last word and letting her eyes roam hungrily over Sam's toned body.</p>
<p>"'K," Sam swallowed, regaining herself a bit. She looked Brooke in the eyes. "Is this all this is, Brooke? Sex? Or is it...will it be more?" Brooke was stunned by the vulnerable sound to Sam's voice.</p>
<p>"So much more," she assured Sam lovingly. Sam smiled at her. "I love you, Sam. I think more than you realize. It's more than lust or desire," she explained reaching up to brush Sam's brown hair away from her eyes.</p>
<p>"It's way deeper than that, I swear."</p>
<p>"So," Sam smirked. "Does this mean we're a...a couple now?" Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"Do you want to be?" she asked praying that Sam said yes. To her relief and joy, Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said shyly. "I'd like that a lot."</p>
<p>"Me too, Sammy," Brooke agreed. Deciding that the time for heavy talk was over, Brooke moved back to what she had been doing. She loved Sam's breasts and could entertain herself for a long time with them, Sam too.</p>
<p>"One more thing," Sam ground out after much effort.</p>
<p>"Ummmmhmmmmm?" Brooke hummed back.</p>
<p>"This stays between us for now," Sam asked breathlessly as her body arched into Brooke's gentle but persistant touch.</p>
<p>"Whatever you want, Sammy," Brooke vowed. "Whatever you want."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam stretched lazily and rolled over to find the bed empty. She blinked in mild confusion and tried to get her mind to clear.</p>
<p>(I didn't dream all that, did I?) she wondered briefly. (If I did, I am much more of a perv than I thought)</p>
<p>Finally waking up fully, she realized that she was in Brooke's room, lying naked in the former cheerleader's bed. She grinned.</p>
<p>(DEFINITELY not a dream) she stretched again and winced. (God, I'm sore as Hell. What did she do to me?)</p>
<p>Of course, the answer to that was still vividly fresh in Sam's mind. She never would have imagined Brooke to be as wildly passionate or as uninhibited as she turned out to be. Brooke knew what she wanted and what she liked and wasn't afraid to let Sam know. It had been a mind blowing experience.</p>
<p>She heard the shower running in the bathroom and let herself fantasize about the blonde beauty under the spray. It was a long-standing guilty hobby before events unfolded as they had. And she wasn't about to stop even now, it was too much fun. Although the imagined Brooke was nothing compared to the real thing.</p>
<p>"Lazy thing," Brooke chided from the doorway, breaking Sam from the semi-doze she'd slipped back into. Sam stared at Brooke standing wrapped only in a towel and with her hair still wet.</p>
<p>"You're a Goddess," Sam whispered in awe. She watched as a pink flush spread across Brooke's exposed skin.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she mumbled with a smirk. "You'd better get moving if you're going to shower before school," she advised. Sam crinkled her nose.</p>
<p>"I don't wanna go!" she declared burrowing under the blankets again. Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"Neither do I. I'd rather stay here in bed with you all day and learn more about how to make you moan and scream," she blushed. She heard Sam chuckle under the covers.</p>
<p>"Yeah me too."</p>
<p>"Anyway, we both have Math tests today. Remember what the teacher said? No make-ups and it's worth 30% of our grades this term," Brooke reminded her.</p>
<p>"Awwww..." Sam whined. "You suck." Brooke quirked an eyebrow devilishly.</p>
<p>"I lick and bite too," she retorted saucily. "But we haven't got time for me to demonstrate right now. We overslept as it is."</p>
<p>"Potty mouth," Sam accused playfully while removing herself from the bed. Brooke watched with undisguised lust.</p>
<p>"And you love it," she threw back, kissing Sam deeply as she passed. She pinned the brunette to the wall for a minute, kissing her hungrily before breaking away and leaving Sam panting. "And I promise to demonstrate some more later, if you behave yourself today."</p>
<p>"Oh you tease," Sam sighed longingly. It was going to be a long day.</p>
