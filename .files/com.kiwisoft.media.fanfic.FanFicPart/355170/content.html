<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Two -->

<p>Sam stared at the ceiling. Despite the fact that everything with their parents had gone very well, she wasn't able to sleep. She was restless and yet not all that tense. It was more of a hyper-awake and her mind was filled with a myriad of different thoughts.</p>
<p>&lt;Wow, Mom and Mike are OK with Brooke and I being in love with each other. I know that's a lot for anyone to take, especially our parents but I am SO relieved&gt; she thought to herself. She even noted that her stomach seemed to have already calmed down some. &lt;And they took care of Nicole and Harrison for us, plus Mary Cherry has done a complete turn around and isn't against us. Maybe school won't be so rough anymore&gt;</p>
<p>Normally she would have gotten out of bed and taken a late night shower or had a late night snack like tea and crackers to help her body relax enough to sleep but she couldn't get out of bed at the moment. Brooke was using her shoulder as a pillow. They'd curled up together in Sam's bed after saying goodnight to their parents. </p>
<p>Although the blonde was silent, Sam had noticed the change in her breathing and subtle movement of muscles indicating that Brooke was awake. She watched as Brooke's eyes fluttered open and stayed downcast like she was deep in thought. She continued to observe Brooke as she bit her bottom lip in concentration and shifted in the bed again, this time in what struck Sam as slight discomfort. A heavy sigh slipped from Brooke's lips and Sam decided that she couldn't be quiet any longer.</p>
<p>"Hey, love, what's wrong?" she asked tracing Brooke's blonde eyebrows with the pads of her fingertips, following them as they sloped downward with Brooke's frown. </p>
<p>"Nothing, just thinking," Brooke responded, still not meeting Sam's rich chocolate eyes and moving in the bed again.</p>
<p>"Can't get comfortable?" Sam wondered as Brooke sighed again. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, I'm fine. It's not that," she explained, leaning into Sam's touch as Sam ran her fingers through the sea of blonde hair. She loved it when Sam did that.</p>
<p>"Then what is it? You're tense," Sam pointed out placing a soft kiss to Brooke's exposed shoulder. Brooke was silent again, seeming to think over her answer and looking everywhere but into Sam's eyes.</p>
<p>"I just?go back to sleep, Sammy. I'm fine," she seemed to finally decide.</p>
<p>"OK," Sam sighed defeated. "I won't push if that's how you want it." She kissed Brooke's ear and lay her head back on the pillow. She had closed her eyes but opened them when she felt the warm wash of Brooke's breath against her face.</p>
<p>She looked directly into Brooke's eyes and swallowed convulsively. There was an intensity and look of hunger in Brooke's hazel eyes that surprised her.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" she started only to be silenced by Brooke's fingers over her mouth.</p>
<p>"Shhh?" Brooke whispered, staring at Sam's mouth for a moment and them back up into her eyes. Sam watched the blonde's hazel eyes visibly darken and become hooded. The heated stare she was receiving was making her body come alive and Brooke had yet to even touch her.</p>
<p>"I want you, Sam," Brooke all but growled, licking her lips and seeming to bare her teeth. Pure lust and desire shot through Sam like a lightening bolt causing her to whimper.</p>
<p>"Oh God," she gasped as Brooke moved against her, this time with a clear intent. She kissed Sam, increasing the pressure and intensity of the kiss as Sam moaned into her mouth. Brooke's hands actively began roaming hungrily over Sam's body, slipping beneath her oversized nightshirt to tease the warm skin underneath. Her nails lightly raked up Sam's sides, across her abdomen and up her chest where Brooke settled her hot palms against Sam's breasts.</p>
<p>She captured Sam's mouth again, biting down on her bottom lip as she sucked it into her mouth. Sam whimpered and squirmed beneath her.</p>
<p>"I love kissing you," Brooke whispered into her ear. "You taste so good. I've been lying here thinking about what I want to do to you." Her voice was husky, almost gravely and it sent chills down Sam's spine to hear.</p>
<p>"Tell me," Sam begged, her voice itself nothing more than a breathy rasp. "What do you want to do?" Brooke smiled and moved so that she was straddling Sam's waist staring down at her.</p>
<p>"I want to touch all of you," she started, kneading Sam's breasts and brushing her thumbs across her nipples.</p>
<p>"I want to taste all of you," she continued as she nipped and licked her way across Sam's jaw line. "I want to feel you move, hear your moans and cries. I want to drive you crazy." She was growling now as she rocked against Sam. Sam could feel the blonde's muscles rippling beneath her hands as she stroked and scratched at Brooke's back.</p>
<p>"You are?" Sam admitted quietly. Brooke laughed softly.</p>
<p>"Not yet I'm not," she smirked and Sam shivered again. "I want to take you in my mouth and taste YOU, Sam. The most intimate you. I want to experience your flavor on my tongue, your juices filling my mouth as I seek out your most hidden spots. I want to lick my way around you, worship you the way you should be worshipped."</p>
<p>"Oh sweet Jesus," Sam involuntarily arched against Brooke seeking more contact. They were both naked, Brooke having discarded their nightclothes as she spoke. Brooke's skin was so hot Sam felt as though she was being burned wherever they touched.</p>
<p>"I want to feel your hands in my hair, pulling me closer, keeping me close as I pleasure you. I want to feel you pant and whimper and cry out for me, because of me. I want to feel how wet you get when I graze my teeth across your clit and slip my tongue deep inside you."</p>
<p>Sam was shaking intensely as Brooke spoke because while being fairly verbose, the lanky blonde was far from idle. Her mouth had teased and sucked Sam's nipples to the point of pain while her teeth had left small red marks along Sam's collarbone, down her breasts and down around her belly button. Her hands had massaged Sam's thighs and gently spread them apart and now she lay perched with her head hovering over Sam's aching core, inhaling her lover's sweet scent.</p>
<p>"Broooooooooke?" Sam whined.</p>
<p>"Shhh?" Brooke soothed, running a slender finger over Sam's swollen lips and coating herself in the brunette's essence.</p>
<p>"So wet?" she breathed, letting her hot breath splash across Sam's over-sensitized flesh and hearing her whimper even as the body below hers involuntarily twitched towards her.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to do all that, Sam?" she asked quietly. Sam's back arched, bringing her closer to Brooke and leaving a large gap between her body and the bed.</p>
<p>"Yesssss," Sam hissed pitifully, her hands balled into fists by her sides as Brooke had absolute command of her body. "Please." Brooke didn't answer her; instead she flattened her tongue and dragged it slowly vertically across Sam's sex. She kept her eyes fixed on the beautiful face above her. Sam's eyes were clenched shut and a long whine that was almost a sob came from somewhere in the back of her throat.</p>
<p>"God?" she gasped, the only coherent noise Brooke could understand from her. Brooke found herself intoxicated by Sam's taste. Each time she made love to Sam it was a new experience but this time, she realized, with her returning memories, her original feelings for Sam were returning as well. She LOVED the girl so much her chest ached and she truly did want to experience every bit of her. She didn't think there was a way she could ever get enough of her Sam.</p>
<p>"My Sammy," she whispered as she blew air across Sam's wet skin. Sam moaned and dug her fingernails into Brooke's shoulders.</p>
<p>"Yours?" she agreed in a hissing pant. She whimpered again as Brooke took her clit into her mouth and suckled it. Two of Brooke's long sculpted fingers expertly found their way into Sam's center and the brunette's body instinctively clamped down on them as they moved.</p>
<p>"God, Brooke," Sam panted, her voice hitching and rising slightly in pitch.</p>
<p>"Mmmm, Sam?you taste so good," Brooke hummed against her.</p>
<p>"God, baby, please," Sam begged for release. Brooke had indeed succeeded in driving her insane with need. Brooke started stroking in and out of Sam faster, trying to help Sam reach her climax.</p>
<p>"Come for me, baby," she coaxed the frantically bucking girl under her hands. "Let me feel that, taste that." Sam was all but crying, sobs and whimpers tumbling from her lips in a constant flow as she moved with Brooke.</p>
<p>"I want to, oh God, I want to, baby," she panted in between cries and whimpers. Brooke curled her fingers slightly and grazed Sam's clit with her teeth. Sam froze and her breath came out as a grunt as a powerful orgasm ripped through her, causing her back to arch off the bed and her entire body to spasm.</p>
<p>"UUUHHHHHHH, BROOKE!" she cried. As her body shook, Brooke moved to hold her until it passed, whispering soothing words and petting her sweat dampened hair. Harsh pants racked Sam's frame as she returned to herself in Brooke's arms. As Sam lay catching her breath, Brooke could hear small little whimpers coming from her.</p>
<p>"You OK, Sammy?" she whispered, placing a kiss to Sam's temple. She felt Sam nod.</p>
<p>"Yeah," was the sleepy response. Brooke smiled.</p>
<p>"Go to sleep, Sammy," she advised lovingly. Sam shifted slightly and forced her heavy eyelids open.</p>
<p>"But?" she started to protest. Brooke kissed her lightly on the lips.</p>
<p>"Sleep, Sam. I'll still be here in the morning."</p>
