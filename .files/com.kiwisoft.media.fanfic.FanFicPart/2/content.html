<!-- Road Rage -->

<p>It is said that in times of violent accidents time slows down for
those witnessing it.  It is also said that these events happen with
an acutely crystal sense of clarity.  That became painfully clear to
Sam as she followed Brooke out through the lobby of the building.
Things had just gone downhill so quickly that she'd been unable to
stop it.  It was like a snowball rolling down a hill gathering speed
and more snow about to collide with a brickwall and destroy them
all.  As much as she and Brooke fought most of the time, this was too
much.  She couldn't just let Brooke rush out upset like that. They'd
come too far in their relationship and she truly cared for her soon-
to-be stepsister.  Very deeply, in fact.  </p>

<p>Sam was upset with herself for hurting Brooke with this stupid game
she was playing with Harrison.  And if she was truthful, that's what
it was too, a game.  Something to compete with Brooke for; something
to beat Brooke at.  They may have come far in their relationship and
gotten beyond their outright hatred but they both still enjoyed a
good verbal fracas with the other from time to time.  And Sam
couldn't resist the chance to one-up Brooke any chance she got.  In
that respect, Sam was still a nine-year-old on the school playground
involved in a twisted game of tag. And Sam hated to lose.  </p>

<p>But this time she'd gone too far and she knew it.  The look on
Brooke's face when Harrison gave them his decision was enough to
destroy that little kick Sam got from winning.  She saw the hurt and
the betrayal splashed across Brooke's face and realized that maybe it
wasn't a game.  Maybe Brooke really wanted Harrison as more than a
friend and Sam had just taken him away.  &lt;Way to go, Sam!&gt; She
berated herself as she chased after Brooke.  Her little exchange with
Brooke as they exited the building left her confused and bewildered.
But as she hit the night air, time slowed down and everything snapped
into painful focus.   </p>

<p>She saw Brooke run into the street.  She saw the headlights
of the car bearing down on Brooke as the girl just stood there frozen
with fear and shock.  If you had asked her and she had the time to
answer you, Sam could have told you the make and model and color of
the car.  She could have told you how the headlights gleamed off of
the jewelry Brooke wore and how wide Brooke's eyes had become.  She
also, somewhat belatedly, could see who was driving although her
brain didn't make the immediate connection.  All she could see was
that the car was bearing down on Brooke with frightening speed and
the other girl seemed unable to move.  She noticed all of this even
as adrenaline pumped through her veins and her legs propelled her
forward as a cry born of fear escaped her lips.</p>

<p>"Brooke!  No!" Sam's cry seemed to free Brooke from the
frozen stupor she was momentarily stuck in and she screamed as she
threw her hands up in defense.  She turned to see Sam barreling
towards her just as the speeding car came upon her.  She felt the
full-on body check Sam gave her and felt herself falling painfully
onto the asphalt a few feet away.  She watched in utter horror as the
car struck Sam, who was not able to get out of the way in time.  Now
it was Brooke's turn to watch events unfold in aching clarity.</p>

<p>The sights and sounds of this night were going to haunt
Brooke for the rest of her life.  She knew that somewhere in the back
of her mind, as she could do nothing but sit and watch events now.
Time seemed to stop for one heart wrenching second and her eyes met
Sam's.  She could see the apology written in Sam's deep brown eyes as
the car hit her but Brooke didn't have time to understand what it
meant as time returned to normal.  </p>

<p>Brooke watched as the car struck Sam on her side and sent her flying
heavily into the hood.  Her head impacted with the windshield with a
sickening crack, shattering the glass.  She slid off the hood and
fell to the roadway before rolling limply to a stop a few feet away.
Brooke barely noticed that the car had skidded into a lamppost
further down the road as she scrambled to Sam's side.</p>

<p>Blood was pouring freely from numerous visible wounds and
Brooke shuttered to think about the internal damage that common sense
told her Sam had suffered.  Reaching out a shaking hand, she checked
Sam's neck for a pulse and found one faintly pulsing beneath her
fingers.  Releasing the breath she'd unconsciously been holding, she
tore off a piece of her dress and used it to put pressure on a nasty
gash across Sam's forehead.  She repeated the process a few times on
Sam's arms and legs to stem the bleeding, all the while talking
gently to the unconscious girl.</p>

<p>"That was pretty stupid, Sam, jumping in front of that car
like that.  Not that I don't appreciate it, because I do, believe me,
I do.  But, oh God, Sam, risking your life for mine?  That was kind
of stupid."</p>

<p>"Brooke?  Oh, God Sam!  Brooke, what happened?" Harrison
asked after coming out a few minutes later when he heard the
commotion outside.  Brooke never looked up from her administrations.</p>

<p>"Car came at me, Sam pushed me out of the way.  Have you
called 911?" she asked calmly as she brushed some hair away from
Sam's still face.  Harrison was surprised at how calm Brooke was as
she continued to take care of Sam.  The sight of Sam lying there so
still and obviously gravely injured nearly made him physically sick.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I called as soon as I saw someone was hit.  They'll be
here any minute, Brooke.  How is she?" Brooke shook her head and
sighed.</p>

<p>"Bad, Harrison.  But she's holding on.  Can I have your
jacket?" He silently took off his jacket and she draped it over Sam
who was starting to stir.</p>

<p>"Uugg...Br...Brooke?" she gasped as her eyes opened fractionally
and tried to focus as she struggled to move.</p>

<p>"Right here, Sammy, easy, don't move," Brooke answered with a
wide but sad smile.  Sam's eyes fluttered before settling on Brooke
for a moment and then closing again.  She seemed to relax when she
saw Brooke was there.</p>

<p>"You...OK?" Sam asked between shuttering gasps.  Brooke looked
at her worriedly.  There was a trickle of blood coming from Sam's
mouth that was steadily getting worse.  Evidence of those internal
injuries Brooke had been worried about.</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Sam, thanks to you.  You saved my life.  How do
you feel?  Ambulance in on the way so don't worry," she rambled,
trying to reassure her stepsister.  Sam frowned in pain.</p>

<p>"Hurts...cold..." Sam shuttered.  Brooke tucked the jacket in
tighter around Sam's shoulders and brushed her cheek.  There was
barely a spot on Sam's face that wasn't either covered in blood or
dirt but Brooke didn't care.  She just wanted Sam to keep breathing.
&lt;Please, God let her hold on&gt;</p>

<p>"It's OK, Sam.  We'll get you to a hospital and you'll be
fine," Brooke wished she felt half as sure as she sounded.  But she
wasn't.  Sam was starting to shake and Brooke didn't know if it was
from shock or blood loss or both.  She could hear the sirens in the
distance.  "Hear that, Sam?  They're almost here so hang on a bit
longer.  Hey, Harrison?"  Harrison walked closer again.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Brooke?" he asked quietly.  His stomach was turning as
he watched one of his childhood and best friends lie on the pavement
possibly dying.  He was powerless to do anything and it was twisting
him inside.</p>

<p>"The car is over there.  Find the driver.  I want to know who
did this," Brooke said in a voice so full of anger and rage that it
frightened Harrison.  He had never, EVER heard her speak in such a
voice.  It sounded alien coming from her.  </p>

<p>"Brooke, I..."</p>

<p>"Do it, Harrison!" Brooke commanded with such venom that
Harrison jumped and walked briskly over to the oddly familiar car.
As he got closer to the vehicle, he realized why he recognized it.</p>

<p>"Jesus, it's Nicole's car," he swore to himself.  Not wanting
to believe his eyes, Harrison looked into the car and saw Nicole's
unconscious form slumped over the deflated airbag.  He reached in and
checked for a pulse and found it going strong.</p>

<p>"I don't know if that's a good thing for you given the way
Brooke just acted, Nic," Harrison told her rather angrily.  He
sniffed the air and his anger rose.  "Christ, are you drunk?"  Unable
to keep speaking to a sleeping figure, he slapped her, not too
lightly.  Nicole's head snapped up and her eyes fluttered open.</p>

<p>"Huh?  Wha...?" Nicole slurred drunkenly as she reached up to
wipe at the blood from a small cut on her forehead.  She looked at
the blood on her fingers in confusion and then at Harrison.  "What're
you doin' here, loser?" she spat.</p>

<p>"Damn you, Nicole.  Damn you to Hell!  Do you have ANY idea
what you have done?" he screamed at her.  Nicole blinked owlishly at
him for a second.  Then images of running Brooke down with her car
ran through her alcohol-fogged mind and she couldn't surpress a
giggle.</p>

<p>"Playing `Frogger' with Brookie?  It's just a dream,
Harrison.  Why are you here anyway?  Go away," Harrison opened the
car door and roughly pulled Nicole out, not caring if she was
actually hurt.  "What are you doing, you psycho?  Let go of me!"
Nicole protested as Harrison dragged her over to the scene of her
carnage.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a dream, Nicole.  Look.  Look at what you've
done!" he screamed at her when they reached where Brooke still sat
cradling Sam who was semi-conscious.  Nicole looked at the bloodied
form of her most hated enemy and her best-friend (former) sitting
next to her.</p>

<p>"Aw, I missed Brookie and hit Spam instead.  Not bad for a
consolation prize," Nicole snickered. "Heh heh, Spam went splat!"
Brooke looked up in shock and then stared speechless.</p>

<p>"It was Nicole, Brooke," Harrison said needlessly.  "She's
drunk and thinks this is a dream." Brooke nodded and carefully laid
Sam back on the ground before she stood up to face her would-be-
killer.  She looked the still giggling girl up and down in distaste
as if seeing her for the first time.  Before Harrison or Nicole knew
what was happening, Brooke pulled back and punched Nicole so hard in
the jaw that Nic went flying to the ground in pain.</p>

<p>"OW!  Jesus!" Nicole exclaimed in pain as she held her
throbbing jaw.  All thought that this was an alcohol-induced
hallucination vanished with Brooke's action and the realization that
this was real chilled Nicole to her core.  She looked up at the
person who was once the best friend she ever had and saw only hate
and rage staring back at her.</p>

<p>"Not so funny now, is it, Nic?" Brooke growled.  Nicole shook
her head mutely.  She'd never seen Brooke so angry or known her to
hit anyone, aside from the story of the once she slapped Spam.
Sobriety sped up behind Nicole and slammed into her as she realized
exactly what she had done.  She scrambled to her feet and looked back
at Sam as Brooke sat back down and the ambulance pulled up.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, what have I done?" Nicole whispered in utter
horror.  The paramedics began to treat Sam and Brooke turned her
attention back to Nicole.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you a few things, Nicole," she started, her
voice startingly calm.  It reminded Nicole of those few minutes right
before a massive thunderstorm when the wind stops, there are no birds
or anything else disturbing the air and everything is just still.  It
was scary to hear the sound coming from the usually vibrant Brooke
but she listened intently.  "First off, let me tell you that no
matter what happens, I will never forgive you for this.  I know you
were aiming for me and if it weren't for Sam, I'd probably be dead
now.  But that's besides the point." She took a step closer to Nicole
who unconsciously took a step back.</p>

<p>"I think you should know that I am going to dedicate every
moment I have that I don't spend helping Sam recover making sure that
you get EXACTLY what you deserve.  And if, God forbid, Sam doesn't
make it, there won't be anywhere you can go or anything you can do
that is going to stop me from making you pay." Finished, she walked
back over to the paramedics, leaving Nicole with Harrison.  Nicole
wasn't sure what scared her more; the threat itself or the fact that
Brooke's voice never changed the entire time she spoke.</p>

<p>Harrison watched in silence as Brooke handed down her
sentence to Nicole and was just as scared as Nicole was.  He had also
never seen such rage and hatred come from the normally kind and
gentle cheerleader.  Brooke was known for her understanding and
ability to forgive.  And while he understood why Brooke would be
upset, Nicole had just tried to run her down and nearly killed Sam by
the look of it, the depth of the emotions seemed somehow out of
place.  </p>

<p>Sure, Sam was going to be Brooke's stepsister and the two were
growing closer but, Brooke was acting, odd, and Harrison just
couldn't put his finger in it.  There was a long-standing history
between Brooke and Sam and most of it wasn't good.  And then there
was this whole thing between them involving him.  That was bound to
cause even more friction between the two girls.  But while he knew
Brooke would never want to see harm come to anyone, even Sam, he
couldn't wrap his mind around her overly hostile reaction to Nicole.
Anger and outrage he would have expected, outright blinding rage and
wrath was a little over the top.  He was then distracted when he saw
a police officer approaching.</p>
