<!-- The Longest Hours \ Part 2-->
<p><i>Days they turn into weeks,<br>
That's how good this has been.<br>
Still, I can't believe the way<br>
This first year has flownâ€¦</i></p>
<p>The feeling within Lilly was unpleasant as she cleared the books from her shelves and piled them steadily, one by one, into the plastic crate she had brought with her from home just over nine months ago. She wrinkled her nose when she caught sight of the thin layer of dust that had gathered behind and between the spaces of her books, gradually smeared across the shelves when she had taken each one down for studying.</p>
<p>Her room was becoming bleaker by the minute; the walls blotched with spots of sticky-tack that had held up posters and pictures of friends and family. Her bed consisted only of the mattress which the university accommodation had supplied her since her own bedding was packed neatly away into a large storage bag. In fact, all of her worldly belongings had been reduced down into containers and sacks which sat in the corner of the room, alongside a large suitcase, and ready for when her mother would arrive to help her move them into storage, for next year.</p>
<p>Lilly sighed and straightened up to push her hair back from her face. She had done it â€“ she was ready to move out and officially end her first year at college. There would be a long summer in between her term starting up again when she would become a second year. Most students looked forward to this, and she would certainly approve of the Californian weather. However, even the promise of endless sunshine was not enough to draw her away from the knowledge that the summer, consisting of almost three months of freedom, would be formed of the longest hours.</p>
<p>She hummed quietly to herself as she checked over her old bedroom once more, in case she had happened to miss anything, when she heard a knock on the door. Lilly frowned slightly, for her mother had arranged to meet her outside since she did not have access to the building. The knock was repeated though and Lilly went to greet the visitor.</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>A brunette girl, who was definitely not Lilly's mother, was standing in the entrance to her room and Lilly smiled, "Miley? What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, "I couldn't leave without saying goodbye, could I?"</p>
<p>Lilly's smile only grew, "We said goodbye last night though."</p>
<p>The other girl turned shy, "I know. It's just I'm gonna miss you so much that I had to come and see you again this morning."</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes jovially and stepped aside, allowing Miley to wander into the room. "Wow." Miley exhaled, "It looks empty - same as my room."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Lilly said from her position near the door, "I'm going to miss this place."</p>
<p>Miley nodded, "I know what you mean, but things will be better when we're in our own little house next year."</p>
<p>Lilly beamed, "Less annoying boys clogging up the showers with their mysterious hairs."</p>
<p>Miley shuddered, "Less random showerâ€¦activities." She made a face, "There were people going at it in my block this mornin'. They must have wanted to get in a goodbye session for old time's sake." She laughed, "Hopefully there'll be none of that next yearâ€¦ Oliver is clean, isn't he?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, "He's okay."</p>
<p>Miley's smile returned, "I'm so glad we're all living together next year, it's going to be really good, you know?"</p>
<p>"I know. It's a shame we won't see each other over the holidays though." Lilly sighed and the loss resounded in her like an endless echo that reverberated off her ribs and through her chest, filling her with a weakening grief. She didn't know how she had managed to hold herself together this far.</p>
<p>Miley's eyes flickered to the window, "Yeah. I'm sorry too." She turned back to Lilly, "It's okay, we've got email and the phone though."</p>
<p>"If my dad's apartment is linked up to the real world; last time I stayed with him we didn't have such luxuries."</p>
<p>"You're only going there for a couple of weeks though, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Lilly inclined her head, "Yes. And then we're going to Florida to meet my uncle and I've gotta go see my grandparents because they're not getting any youngerâ€¦"</p>
<p>"And the farm awaits." Miley confirmed, "I've missed it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I'll miss you."</p>
<p>Miley smiled, but the expression was tight, "Miss you more."</p>
<p>"Not possible." Lilly almost whispered.</p>
<p>A sweet sorrow was filling Miley's eyes and she stepped nearer Lilly, before stopping herself. "We'll see each other soon, it won't be that long."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, "Nah. It's cool. I've got my doughnut."</p>
<p>"And I've got my chickens." Miley grinned, yet the sadness did not leave her sapphire eyes.</p>
<p>She reached her hand out for Lilly and the blonde placed her own inside of Miley's. Tingles crept across her skin, starting from where Miley was touching her and then they spread out, nestling in her veins and catching the speed of her blood to take the sensation straight to her heart.</p>
<p>"Thank you for the best first year."</p>
<p>"No, thank you for everything." Miley replied and crossed the small space between them to hug Lilly tightly. "See you next year." She whispered gruffly into Lilly's hair, before she broke away to walk to the door. "I'm sorry," Miley sniffed whilst she attempted to hold back the tears, "I suck at goodbyes."</p>
<p>"You don't." Lilly said shakily, "But, I'll see you later."</p>
<p>Miley nodded tensely, and opened her mouth to saying something else, yet thought differently and closed it tightly again. With one final wave, Miley excused herself from Lilly's presence and marched quickly down the hallway.</p>
<p>Lilly listened to Miley's retreating footfall until she could no longer hear the girl. She was left with the silence of her room, and only the occasional snippets of the goings on of other students, who were finalising their packing and making ready to leave the accommodation.</p>
<p>Allowing herself only one groan of pain, Lilly turned to sit on the bare mattress and wait out the coming of her mother. It was one strained hour later, in which Lilly had not moved from her position, that Heather Truscott entered the building and came to find her only daughter in an empty room with a darkness in her eyes that would not be fully re-lit until the summer months had passed.</p>
<p>x-x-x</p>
<p>The skies were grey and Lilly was pacing. It was a hot, June day for all the clouds that covered the cornflower blue, yet the heat was prickly and Lilly was irritable, and only too happy to subject to being driven indoors. Her mother was out and Oliver was busy, so she was totally alone and completely frustrated.</p>
<p>Lilly knew and understood the source of her restlessness; she was waiting for that sacred time of the day, yet she still had three long hours to face before it came about. She was waiting for a message from Miley, either by phone or email, and it always came promptly at six in the evening.</p>
<p>She flumped into her favourite armchair and switched on the TV. The channels could offer her nothing, however, and two hundred flicks of the remote later she turned the screen back to black. Her gaze returned to the windows, her eyes mournfully regarding the clouds that had made the sea swell with a predicted storm which would reach them that night.</p>
<p>"Boredâ€¦" Lilly sighed and tapped her fingers on the arm of her chair. She glanced at the clock and counted down the exact minutes when her mother would be home from work. It was easy to continue the charade of not being obsessed with her college friend when her mother was about and willing to distract her.</p>
<p>Lilly stopped her drumming and instead chewed on her thumbnail, her eyebrows knitted together in thought. <i>What would Miley be doing right now?</i> She smiled to think of Miley in a loose chequered shirt and tight jeans, ripped attractively, sitting atop a horse, or pitch-forking hay in the barn. Her friend was lean and able to complete such tasks with ease, and Lilly loved to remember when the subtle muscularity of her best friend would emerge when she would go out running with Lilly.</p>
<p>"Mileyâ€¦" Lilly said quietly in an exhalation of breath. She ran a hand through her hair and checked the clock once more.</p>
<p>Lilly wrinkled her nose and made her decision. She slowly rose from her seat and completed the short journey up the stairs to her bedroom. Her computer took a while to load and Lilly sat on the edge of her bed whilst it did so, pretending to browse through a magazine, yet the words went unread in her mind for she was too concerned with the long minutes her computer was taking.</p>
<p>The internet was slow too, another painful prolonging of what could be word from Miley and Lilly shook her head, giving in to the fact that she was early and that Miley was probably far too busy to message her every hour of every dayâ€¦</p>
<p><i>One new message â€“ Miley.</i></p>
<p>Lilly's eyes widened, and then the excitement started because she could not hold back the joy she felt from seeing the single envelope icon highlighted on her screen. Throughout the day she attempted to keep her emotions under a strong grip, until she heard from Miley, and then the flood would come.</p>
<p>She was shaking slightly as she moved the mouse across its mat and clicked on the icon. The message itself was very short, but there was an attachment.</p>
<p><i>My broodâ€¦</i></p>
<p>Lilly clicked on the link to the photograph and cursed the machine for being so slow. The download bar signalled that she would have two minutes before the image would be available on the screen, so Lilly stood up to put on a CD and fetch herself a glass of water from the kitchen.</p>
<p>When she returned there was indeed a picture waiting for her on the monitor and Lilly smiled, resting her glass on her bedside-table before hurrying back to her chair and absorbing the photograph in full.</p>
<p>It was a picture of Miley and Lilly laughed at the sight, the glint of pride in her best friend's eyes and the pure happiness that radiated from her was enough to make Lilly's heart sing. Miley was sitting down on the straw-covered floor of a barn on her family's property, with the brightest smile that lit up her entire expression. She was wearing a chequered shirt, just as Lilly had imagined, and her hair hung loose and curly over her shoulders. Her blue eyes were very much alive, even in this still image and Lilly found herself getting completely lost in them.</p>
<p>Yet as Lilly looked closer at the picture she understood the meaning behind the words in Miley's email, for gathered in a little cluster in front of Miley's legs were a group of baby chicks. They were a fluffy mixture of yellows and browns and were smaller than Lilly's fist if she clenched it. "Miley's broodâ€¦" Lilly murmured to herself and her own eyes burned with a delight which mirrored Miley's happiness.</p>
<p>"God, I miss youâ€¦" Lilly whispered and raised a hand to rest it gently against her computer screen, just over Miley and she longed, as she did in every hour of the endless days that she were there with her.</p>
<p>x-x-x</p>
<p>Small bonfires crackled on the beach and Lilly sat with Oliver on the sand, along with both of their nuclear families. It was late at night but the plan was to wait for the sun to set before they would start with the fireworks this year. There were many people gathered in groups of close friends and family, who had come down to the beach to celebrate their independence. The pier was the place to be since, from the end of it, Malibu's governing body had arranged for fireworks to be released into the sky.</p>
<p>Lilly inhaled deeply and tilted her head back to look at the stars. They were burning brightly in the heavens above them on this clear, July night and the air was still warm against their skin, yet soothing after the hot summer's day.</p>
<p>"Do you reckon the fireworks will be better than last year's display?" Oliver asked through a mouthful of half-chewed hotdog.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled after she had thrown Oliver a disgusted look, "They seem to get better every year so I don't think we'll be left disappointed." Oliver nodded and proceeded to squash the rest of the snack into his mouth. "And sometimes I wonder why you don't have a girlfriend." Lilly muttered sarcastically as she watched Oliver swallow the whole mouthful with difficulty.</p>
<p>Oliver only glowered at her and was about to retort when suddenly, with a great rushing noise, the first rocket was released into the night's sky.</p>
<p>A great cheer went up among those assembled and the citizens of Malibu who had made it to the beach leapt to their feet and stood with their loved ones, watching the bursts of coloured sparks fill the black skies. Lilly stood smiling and laughing, her mother was nearby and beaming beneath the brilliance of it all whilst Oliver whooped with all the guys when a rocket shocked the crowds as it went off like a cannon.</p>
<p>There was something about this patriotic night where everyone around her had come to celebrate the historic arrival of their independence that had Lilly quietly choked for words. She was glad of the display above them, that she didn't have to speak and she could instead absorb the temporary artwork that had them all spellbound.</p>
<p>A slight vibration originating near her leg, however, drew her attention partially away from the night's brilliance. She slipped her hand into her pocket and drew out her phone, about to cancel the call which was serving as a minute distraction during the firework show.</p>
<p>Lilly stopped herself as soon as she read the name on the screen, and she quickly answered, "Hello?"</p>
<p>"â€¦Do you know that there's still a chance for you? There's a spark in you, you just gotta ignite the light and let it shineâ€¦" Lilly smiled as she struggled to hear the singing above the awe of the crowd. She stumbled away from her group and climbed a sand dune behind them so that she could stand at the top and listen.</p>
<p>"â€¦Just own the night, like the fourth of July! Because, baby, you're a firework! Come on show 'em what you're worth. Make 'em go oh, oh, oh, as you shoot across the sky, sky sky!â€¦"</p>
<p>"Miley?" Lilly asked of the phone and heard a burst of laughter at the other end.</p>
<p>"â€¦Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow, and when it's time you'll knowâ€¦Baby you're a firework, come on let your colours burst!"</p>
<p>"Why are you singing Katy Perry?"</p>
<p>"Boom, boom, boomâ€¦ Even brighter than the moon, moon, moonâ€¦ It's always been inside of you, and now it's time to let it throughâ€¦."</p>
<p>"â€¦Because baby you're a firework!" Lilly joined in this time and Miley laughed again. "Are you quite done yet?" Lilly asked teasingly, her heart aglow with all the lights that currently filled the skies above her.</p>
<p>Miley's laughter eventually eased off, "I'm done. Happy 4th July, Lilly."</p>
<p>"Happy 4th July to you too, Miley."</p>
<p>x-x-x</p>
<p>Oliver was watching Lilly carefully as she sat on the couch in their lounge and stared blankly at the wall opposite them. She had been stuck in this quiet rut from the moment she got off the phone with Miley a half hour ago and Oliver was getting concerned.</p>
<p>"Lilly? Are you okay?"</p>
<p>Lilly blinked and released a sigh, "Yeah."</p>
<p>Oliver frowned before sitting down beside her and reaching out a tentative hand, "Do you want to talk about it?"</p>
<p>Lilly turned to meet his eyes, "There's nothing to talk about really." She replied expressionlessly, "Miley's going to be late getting here because of a fuel leak covering half of the main runway at her local airport."</p>
<p>Oliver nodded, "Yeah, there is only one plane out a day from Crowley Corners airfield in our direction, so she won't be with us until tomorrow."</p>
<p>"If then." Lilly murmured morosely, "Who knows how long it'll take? It's still pumping out more stuff onto the tarmac and that could take <i>days</i> to clean up."</p>
<p>"Are you being a bit dramatic?" Oliver asked gently.</p>
<p>"Could you be anymore of a boy?" Lilly retorted and got to her feet.</p>
<p>"She won't be any later than a couple of days." Oliver answered, refusing to bite back because he knew Lilly better.</p>
<p>Lilly grew tense, "A couple of days? You say that like it's some small thing, Oliver. Do you know how long I have waited to see her? Ollie, it's been the <i>longest hours</i>â€¦" Lilly raised her hands to run her fingers through her hair in frustration.</p>
<p>Oliver rose to stand next to Lilly and surprised the blonde when he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her. "Just one more day, Lilly, and we'll sit through this one together."</p>
<p>Lilly released a shaky sigh, "I am just being dramatic, aren't I?"</p>
<p>Oliver shook his head, "Nah."</p>
<p>"Because, everyday I love her a little bit more."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>x-x-x</p>
<p>Lilly was lying on her bed, waiting, and the clock couldn't have been clicking each second through more slowly if it tried. Every single noise in the house irritated her and every time the door opened and closed again she would twitch, her body sitting upright before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>Each time it had been a false hope she had felt the rage increase until it had crept up from the fierce beating of her heart to a scream that was lodged in her throat, ready to spill over if she was provoked. Such raw emotion was tiring, however, and she had resigned to lying back with a pillow over her face to block out most of the noise.</p>
<p>Oliver left the house to go shopping for their supper that night, which had meant another rise of hope. Things had been quiet for the past hour and a half though, and Lilly's pulse rate had returned to normal. She was waiting and she couldn't have been doing it in a more punishing way, since she could find no distractions and couldn't be bothered to socialise with Oliver.</p>
<p>Just as she was beginning to relax, the door opened again and Lilly cursed Oliver for not having locked it properly. A female voice was conversing with him in the hallway and Lilly rolled her eyes â€“ it was probably Joannie again, returning to borrow yet another staple food from their fridge. At lunchtime she had come for a glass of milk and the previous day it had been a slice of bread.</p>
<p>"Don't know why she doesn't just bother moving inâ€¦" Lilly muttered grumpily into her pillow.</p>
<p>"Lilly!" Oliver's voice was calling her up the stairs and she rolled over, pressing the pillow against her ears. When Oliver didn't hear a response, he said something to the other person downstairs and shouted back, "I'm going out. I'll be back later."</p>
<p>Lilly pulled the pillow around her tighter, and she didn't even hear the door close again. She let her eyes slip shut and willed for sleep to come, a nap would be a nice reprieve from the dullness of waiting.</p>
<p>"Lilly?" The sound was muffled but someone was definitely shouting her name again from downstairs.</p>
<p>"Eugh. Go away." Lilly murmured and yawned, this was all very boring.</p>
<p>"Lilly!" The voice was trying to penetrate through the thickness of her barrier, yet Lilly wouldn't let it and she curled up on the bed.</p>
<p>Silence fell then, thickly and Lilly held her breath, waiting to see if the person would try again, or whether they would politely bow out and leave.</p>
<p>"YOU'RE A JACKASS NUMBER EIGHT!"</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes snapped open at once and she jerked into full consciousness. It was like someone had kick-started her heart and it pounded fully in her chest, revelling in feeling more alive than it had in months. She sat up on the mattress, her feet hitting her bedroom floor hard and she leapt up to throw open her bedroom door, "Miley?"</p>
<p>"Lilly!"</p>
<p>Her voice was even sweeter now that it was not diluted through a telephone line and Lilly raced along the small corridor until she was standing at the top of the stairs, looking down at Miley.</p>
<p>Lilly froze and found she could go no further, she just didn't trust her legs. Every single hour she had waited to see her best friend again was worth it. Each minute she had gruellingly thought about and longed for and pined over the brunette standing before her had fluttered away as if they had only lasted seconds.</p>
<p>"Mileyâ€¦" Lilly sighed and she smiled.</p>
<p>Miley was smiling too from where she stood a couple of steps back from the bottom of the stairs. She had never looked lovelier than in the space of that afternoon; hair wild from the blustering wind outside and cheeks flushed after dragging her suitcase up the street.</p>
<p>Their eyes met and flickered over each other, each young woman drinking in the other she had missed sorely for an entire summer and neither could find the words to say. Lilly felt as if she was drowning in the oceanic depths of Miley's eyes and her gaze strayed to take in every part of her best friend. Her longing was intense, more so than it had been throughout the weeks of getting to know Miley at the beginning of their studies, or through the summer. It was true, every day her affection had grown a little bit more, but now it was palpable and overwhelming.</p>
<p>Then Miley's smile began to dissolve and slide from her face and Lilly felt her heart, a quickly inflating balloon in her chest, retract slightly. Miley's expression turned serious, her eyes wide and blazing with something that Lilly could not interpret.</p>
<p>Miley opened her mouth as if to speak, but then closed it again and broke their eye contact. She looked to the floor and took a deep breath before capturing Lilly up in her cobalt eyes once more.</p>
<p>She spread her hands out before her, imploringly, and did not even blink, so steady was her resolve, "I love you."</p>
<p>Lilly's legs gave out and she grabbed the top of the banister for support, "Youâ€¦ What?"</p>
<p>Miley's lips twitched into a small, helpless smile, "I love you, Lilly." She stepped closer to the stairs, until her hand was resting on the bottom of the banister. Miley fixed her eyes on Lilly, silently pleading with her to speak.</p>
<p>Lilly's hand flew to her throat and her eyes widened. Somehow she managed to straighten out her legs and find the strength to stand. Then, as she looked down upon Miley's beseeching expression and the glimmer of hope in the other girl's eyes, Lilly took her first step down.</p>
<p>"I love you too."</p>
<p>Miley ascended onto the first step, but Lilly was quicker in getting down the stairs to meet her, before she stopped abruptly. They were looking into each other's eyes shyly, both girl trying to determine just what kind of love the other had meant when they had declared it, but Lilly already knew.</p>
<p>She reached out tentatively to rest her hand upon Miley's shoulder and then she leaned down to rest a light kiss against Miley's lips. It only lasted a moment and then Lilly drew away nervously, only to see that Miley's eyes had fluttered shut and the other girl was beginning to smile.</p>
<p>"I may hate goodbyes," Miley said quietly, "but if returning to you means getting that kinda greeting, then perhaps I can give in to them a little more often."</p>
<p>Miley's eyes opened and Lilly suddenly saw within the blaze of clear, sapphire blue the burning adoration Miley held for her.</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, "Yeah, well, there aren't going to be any more goodbyes for a while, okay?"</p>
<p>"Why's that?" Miley asked coyly.</p>
<p>"Becauseâ€¦ Oh, you know why."</p>
<p>"Because you love me?" Miley replied tentatively.</p>
<p>"Yes, and every day it grows just a little bit more."</p>
<p>"Then, what were you waiting for?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." Lilly shrugged, "I just didn't think you would feel the same."</p>
<p>Miley smiled brightly and stepped up to take Lilly into her arms, "Lilly, your eyes make the stars seem like they're not shiningâ€¦ You're so beautiful and amazing andâ€¦"</p>
<p>She couldn't finish her sentence before Lilly had taken advantage and leaned down for another kiss. They stood like that, trapped in an embrace on the stairway of their little house, neither girl speaking for their lips were more than ready to confirm their feelings for one another without the need for words. Yet it only took seconds for the kiss to outgrow the space of the hallway, and one minute later Lilly was dragging Miley up the stairs to inaugurate each of their new bedrooms in the long hours they would spend together.</p>
<p><i>Then you catch me by surprise, when I look in your eyes and you turn and say that you love me...</i></p>
