<p>"I'm gonna beat the living snot out of that jerk," B'Elanna vented, as the Nokk's supporters began to chant his name.</p>
<p>She was just so livid right now. The lieutenant hated bullies, and whenever she encountered one, she wanted nothing better than to teach them a lesson they wouldn't soon forget. And this shithead was asking for it, big time!</p>
<p>"Who is your champion?!" he shouted at the crowd, to which they responded animatedly.</p>
<p>"That yIntagh! I'm gonna rip his head off and shove it up his-" B'Elanna growled, clenching her fists.</p>
<p>"My lovely,.... Please, don't play his game!!" pleaded Edyn, tossing his hands up helplessly, just before the stamping of the staffs initiated another round.</p>
<p>Again, the maidens came into the ring, bearing the wine in goblets. B'Elanna gulped it slower this time, hoping to slow the potent effects of the liquor. When the young ladies departed, the arena was cleared and the two warriors approached each other cautiously. B'Elanna could see that even Jae'Nokk was not immune to the alcohol, in the way his body loosened up.</p>
<p>The fighting that followed in the round was not pretty. It was a drunken mess of blow traded for blow, tit for tat, with the intent on inflicting as much damage as possible. Neither one of the combatants bother to duck or avoid each other's hits. Inevitably, someone's jersey had to be a torn casualty under the circumstances, but fortunately, it wasn't B'Elanna's. At one point in the round, Jae'Nokk landed a body blow just under B'Elanna's diaphragm, seeming to have stunned the Klingon as she stood frozen in mid-motion. The crowd quieted as Jae, sensing his victory, stepped aside, waiting for the woman warrior to topple over.</p>
<p>-BURP!- </p>
<p>Noisy laughter had exploded from the crowd in response after B'Elanna's inadvertent slip, which had only incited Jae'Nokk's antagonism even more.  B'Elanna wiped away the blood that dripped freely down her left brow. If the Doctor saw her now, he'd have a field day with her.  She knew one of her fingers was dislocated, and she forced it back into place with an audible pop. Jae'Nokk was busy nursing his side after B'Elanna had smashed a wicked forearm into his rib cage. Thinking he was too preoccupied, B'Elanna launched into a jump kick, only to be caught on her lower abdomen by a roundhouse kick from Jae.  The Klingon crashed to the floor, but luckily landed unharmed. She rolled away, and managed to flip back onto her feet before Jae'Nokk could stomp his hefty foot on her chest. B'Elanna followed through with a backfist that just caught the Nokk on his cheek. She watched as he backed away with tears stinging his eyes. Finally, the Nokks ended the second round with a resounding smash.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stumbled over to her corner, exhausted by the fighting, and sat on the stool Edyn had stolen. She was aching all over the place, certain there were still a few bones and ligaments out of alignment. Edyn hovered over her pensively, wiping away the blood from her face and smearing some clotting salve into the wounds. He had the distinct impression that a certain pretty, blue-eyed, buxom blonde was going to have his hide when this was all done. He regretted suggesting this foolhardy idea in the first place.</p>
<p>B'Elanna rested her elbows on her knees, trying to catch her breath, knowing the Nokks would start another round soon. She raised her head briefly and looked up at the dais where the EnNokk House sat, watching the match proceedings. The young warriors that surrounded the dais were all speaking excitedly among themselves, mimicking the moves they just saw. But B'Elanna was immediately drawn to the dour expressions on the faces of the EnNokk elders. LenNokk appeared more neutral, but his quietness and posture spoke more volumes. A little confused by her discovery, B'Elanna turned her gaze to EnNokkia, the young lady who had been observing the Klingon for sometime now. The Klingon found a look of slight disappointment in the Nokk's hazel eyes. Dismayed, B'Elanna tore her gaze away from the family.</p>
<p>'Kahless, what a mess this has turned out to be,' she thought to herself.</p>
<p>She had been so angry at Jae'Nokk that she completely forgot her true intentions for entering the tournament. It was supposed to be a noble ritual, but the match had changed into a drunken altercation. Only she and Jae'Nokk were responsible for cheapening the rich cultural expression into a detestable bar room brawl.  She had come here wanting to prove that she was proud of being part Klingon, and to demonstrate her acceptance of her Klingon heritage. Now she had acted dishonorably, and that realization weighed heavily upon her.</p>
<p>At this rate, she would lose, maybe not to Jae'Nokk himself, but to her own past, and the anger she couldn't leave behind. And what about Seven, and her promise to get the Borg back to Voyager. That was the most important thing of all. Suddenly, thinking about Seven brought back memories of the past few days of being with the beautiful blonde, all the obstacles they had face, the laughter they had shared, the touches they had exchanged, and the words they had spoke to each other. At last, her rage calmed, and fell away from her like a broken chain, as it had no meaning anymore. She didn't need her anger to give her courage, though it would always be there. All she really needed was confidence in herself, and knowing the fact that someone else had confidence in her and cared about her. B'Elanna scanned the crowd, wanting so much at that moment to see the young Borg's face, but knowing she would not find her there.</p>
<p>'This was supposed to be a display of skill and honor. And that's what it is going to be.'  B'Elanna swore to herself. </p>
<p>"We should stop this," Edyn told her as he knelt. "Let's stop this, Bey. I mean,...look at what this has done to you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna watched him intently as she toweled herself clean to appear more presentable.</p>
<p>"That's not to say I find you unattractive with the swollen eye and bruised lip. As a matter of fact, it has made you all the more appealing to me, my dear. But I would be willing to give up my commission if you withdraw from the tournament," Edyn persuaded to B'Elanna's amusement.</p>
<p>She patted him reassuringly on the chest to let him know she was all right. Edyn noticed the immediate change in the half-Klingon's demeanor, and moved aside when she stood up. The assembly of warriors lifted their staffs once again, and began the third round without further ado.</p>
<p>Edyn placed a hand on B'Elanna's shoulder before she stepped up to take another goblet of wine. "Ani gave me a message to tell you, when she thought you needed it. She said she believes in you,...and to enjoy yourself..." B'Elanna smiled at him with genuine gratitude.</p>
<p>The crowd stood cheering as the warriors took center stage.  This time, the alcoholic effects of the wine didn't seem to be as debilitating, and B'Elanna concluded her Klingon liver was finally starting to kick in. Instead, the wine gave her a light buzz.  Jae'Nokk, on the other hand, seemed to stumble a bit when he launched out of his corner and moved to the middle of the arena.  He found the impassive expression on his opponent's face slightly intimidating. She no longer had the look of animosity or fury, and that made it harder for him to read her. Jae had thought he would have broken her much earlier, but the woman was resilient, or more like a glutton for punishment.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stretched out the back of her hand in invitation, and waited for his response. Recognizing the gesture, Jae'Nokk crossed her wrist with his own corresponding hand, and they circled each other slowly. The resulting fight resembled little of what had gone before. The adversaries grappled and sparred more, rather than resorting to previous attempts at tearing each other apart, trying to snap one another's bones.  Subsequently, the match became more of a performance where both of them strived to outdo the other in technique. Even the audience sensed the difference in attitude by the combatants, and they began cheering respectfully at the display of skill, instead of rooting boisterously like people at a Hoverball game. Nevertheless, it was evident as the round progressed, the Klingon appeared more in control of her actions, while the young Nokk was challenged by his intoxication and endurance, or lack there of. </p>
<p>Leaning forward, B'Elanna ducked under a very quick cross chop by Jae'Nokk, and kicked up the ball of her foot like a ballerina, feeling it strike something soft. The Nokk stumbled backwards, while the impact sent her body back up into an erect position, ready to engage again. Jae'Nokk later answered that move with one of his own, a nice dropkick to her chest. And there it went, back and forth, but with each passing second, the Klingon became more stimulated and ecstatic about the whole ritual, grinning enthusiastically at her opponent, who was already dragging his feet and looking back at her in amazement.</p>
<p>During the break before the fourth round, the crowd applauded in appreciation for the way the warriors had handled themselves. And B'Elanna hoped that some of the dignity of the tournament was restored. Edyn tried to assess whether the object of his affection was completely plastered, by the way she smiled from ear to ear. He was almost knocked over when B'Elanna clapped him excitedly on the back, and he concluded that his fiery vixen was just happily drunk. Toasting the House, the Klingon swallowed the wine of Nokk eagerly, raring to get back into the match. When she met Jae'Nokk in the middle of the arena, he appeared tipsy but he too grinned. </p>
<p>"Come, Warrior," she beckoned to him.  "Let me show you how we celebrate the drinking of wine in my culture."</p>
<p>Bleary-eyed, she grasped both his arms, and pulled him closer, demonstrating what they were supposed to do. He got the idea, and nodding, clasped her arms tightly as well to prepare himself.  On the count of three, B'Elanna gave the young Nokk a Warrior's Headbutt, and both of them staggered back, dazed, but roaring with enthusiasm. This time the Nokk grabbed B'Elanna's arms and return the headbutt, their heads crashing audibly against each other. The lieutenant shook her head clear from the tremendous impact, and when she opened her eyes again, Jae'Nokk had disappeared.  Apparently, he had dropped bonelessly to the floor after knocking himself out cold against the hard forehead of the Klingon, where she discovered him a few seconds later. She listened to the crowd erupt with cheer as they finally had their champion.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had a difficult time remembering what happened next, as she stood there numb. She found herself surrounded by the assembly of Nokk warriors chanting and thumping their chests. Edyn gently took her by the arm, and humbly led her out of the throng, back up the ramp to present herself before the House of EnNokk to receive her bestowal of honor. When she reached the dais, LenNokk rose out of his chair to greet her, along with the rest of the intimate family.</p>
<p>"I thought we had lost you both," the graying Nokk murmured gravely, giving the half-Klingon a thoughtful look. </p>
<p>"Forgive me if I acted without honor," B'Elanna apologized, ashamed by her initial behavior.</p>
<p>"Thank you for returning our faith in the end," he answered.</p>
<p>"And thank you," he said a bit louder so that the rest of the House, who were watching, could hear.  "For showing our youth what the ritual truly stands for. Over the years, it had become merely a spectator sport that outsiders gambled away their credits on, and the ritual had all but lost its original meaning for my people on this planet. Perhaps now, it will regain some of its cultural significance, if they will remember."</p>
<p>The elders approached their champion, along with a conscious Jae'Nokk, and with benediction, they announced in unison, "Beylanna, Daughter of Miral of the House of Prasba, you have won admiration among our people, and we find you worthy of honor that Nokk himself bestows, with all its privileges."</p>
<p>The circle of Nokks, including Jae'Nokk, bowed deeply in respect for their champion, and B'Elanna, moved by the gesture, returned the bow with Edyn at her side.</p>
<p>"And now, we must celebrate!" declared LenNokk, clapping his hands to summon the wine maidens. "A round of drinks for everyone!"</p>
<p>The audience cheered as the real party started. Music and dancing kept the people busy as the wine and conversation flowed freely. The cloaked figure made its way stealthily through the horde of aliens, unnoticed as it headed towards the unsuspecting Klingon. It was tired of waiting.</p>
<p>Smiling, LenNokk stepped close to B'Elanna, and handed her a scroll. "This contains a poem of your deeds here tonight."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Venerable One," B'Elanna replied, cradling the gift with pride. "I shall value it until the last days of my life."</p>
<p>"There is another issue.... As champion, you have one more privilege. A request, actually, from a lady to spend this evening with our Honored Guest," he added, with a wink, and turned to pull EnNokkia from the circle.</p>
<p>EnNokkia blushed prettily, but moved forward boldly, as the male and female warriors all hushed, waiting for their champion to respond. Before B'Elanna could stop sweating and answer, however, the cloaked figure materialized out from the background, and captured her arm. Everyone, including B'Elanna, tensed at the unexpected threat, but calmly, the figure pulled her hood away, revealing long golden hair that fell softly on slender shoulders.</p>
<p>Seven held B'Elanna's arm possessively. "Your champion will be otherwise preoccupied this evening," she daringly claimed, fixing her patented cool gaze on the Nokk warriors, even as the lieutenant's eyebrows shot up in astonishment.</p>
<p>Edyn hid his grin behind his hand. 'Oh, this just keeps getting better and better,' he chuckled to himself.</p>
<p>The moment of stunned silence that followed was broken suddenly by a gale of laughter from LenNokk, and the rest of the pack joined in lustily, slapping each other uncontrollably on the back. EnNokkia gave Seven a look of jealousy, but even she had to back down from the golden one. She should have known such a warrior would already have a mate.</p>
<p>"This is Annika, my family," B'Elanna introduced, glad that LenNokk found the situation amusing.</p>
<p>"I see," LenNokk replied, as he wiped the tears from his eyes, still chortling, "that you already have a previous engagement. Still, there is one more thing we would like to give you. As the artist for our House, EnNokkia is charged with the task. If your...companion will allow it, please follow her into the Great Hall. She will also show you where you may cleanse yourself."</p>
<p>"That is acceptable," the Borg consented.</p>
<p>Seven arched her brow, releasing B'Elanna's arm, and watched carefully as a befuddled B'Elanna trailed after the young Nokk into the tavern. Hands linked behind her back, Seven approached the big leader of the EnNokk House when she saw B'Elanna disappear through the doorway. There was something she had on her mind that she wished to discuss with the older Nokk.</p>
<p>A little less than an hour later, a fresher looking B'Elanna returned. Seven was in the middle of an arm wrestling match with one of the Nokk youths, when she noticed the half-Klingon making her way through the crowd. She observed suspiciously through narrowing eyes as the lieutenant waddled back from the tavern to the dais, holding her backside with one hand and breathing heavily with pursed lips. Effortlessly, Seven slammed the Nokk's hand down on the table to the young warrior's dismay, ending the match quickly by the time B'Elanna reached her.  Several of the onlookers sighed with adoration, as the sight of the obviously strong, statuesque blonde sent their bosoms heaving.</p>
<p>"Are we done here?" the Borg asked, eager to leave.</p>
<p>"Yes, time to call it a night," B'Elanna agreed, once again wearing her simple Rangoon clothing.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>It was late in the evening already when B'Elanna bid her newfound friends goodnight. She, Seven, and Edyn left the celebration and the drunkenness behind them as they walked out into the cold streets, ready to go home. Edyn had settled the monetary affairs with one of the Nokk elders, as B'Elanna's sponsor, and they asked him to drop off the credits promised to Abcedi in the morning before they parted company. Afterwards, B'Elanna and Seven found themselves alone in the quiet of the darkness as they trudged back to Dannan's house. The ex-drone looked over at B'Elanna who seemed so small at the moment. The remnants of the fight were still plainly evident on her face and her tired appearance. It would not be good if Moka saw B'Elanna looking this way, and the half-Klingon was sure to receive a lecture from both of their adopted caretakers. </p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't know when it happened, but by the time they reached the corner at the end of the block, she found her hand comfortably in Seven's. The moment was broken when they turned the corner. Five hulking shapes were waiting for them.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The half-Klingon could just make out the dark silhouettes that stood beyond the cone of light streaming from the lamp above the abandoned street. She could hear the clicks of guns being loaded, and felt the tingling down her spine that told her some of those guns were aimed at her, and the rest at Seven. When the lieutenant tried to backstep slowly with Seven, the figures spread out to cover their escape. B'Elanna released the Borg's hand, setting herself up so that she could pull the disrupter from her holster, hidden at the small of her waist. </p>
<p>The dark figure Seven recognized earlier sauntered forward, though his gun hung loosely in his grasp at his side. The man sniffed insolently at the air before he addressed them. His familiar, yet haunting voice cracked the cold silence, and for a moment, the Borg almost lost herself in the memory of her previous helplessness.</p>
<p>"Well,...," he began, "looks like we meet again." -Sniff- </p>
<p>B'Elanna tightened her jaw. Even in her slightly intoxicated haze, she immediately identified the cowardly scum that held them at gunpoint. The nefarious figure finally walked into the light, revealing the same yellow skinned jackass who had attacked them before - Kal, plus his riffraff band. Gradually, B'Elanna placed herself in front of the young Borg, wanting instantly to keep Kal as far away from her as possible, and remove Seven from his fetid presence.</p>
<p>"You know Orn, of course. But you haven't met the rest of my crew yet, have you?" he carried on, wanting to demonstrate his control over the captives in front of his men.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" B'Elanna demanded, cutting to the chase. She was not in the best mood for another confrontation tonight.</p>
<p>With his crew at his command, Kal remained unshaken by her tone. In fact, he was going to enjoy beating the insubordinate life out of the troublesome female until she became his lap dog. Then he'd take the other female in front of her just to torment her. The brawny Orn sighed internally. He just wanted to get this whole encounter over with, since he couldn't understand what the big deal was, and why Kal was so obsessed with the two women.</p>
<p>"We want you to hand over your winnings, and come with us," replied Kal, leering at them with his crooked smile, caught up in his own cleverness. "I've been expecting you both."</p>
<p>To B'Elanna's dismay, Seven stepped protectively in front of her, facing Kal openly.  The Klingon slowly began to reach for her weapon.</p>
<p>"I believe you are mistaken. It is we who have been expecting you," Seven told the offensive man.</p>
<p>With that statement, a swarm of shadows emerged from the background and converged on the street corner, surrounding the group. Kal glanced around him as his men were confronted by more than twenty burly Nokk warriors armed to the teeth with canon rifles. </p>
<p>'And I believe I'm about to swoon for this woman,' B'Elanna mused, gazing at the young Borg in worship, her heart about to burst with pride.</p>
<p>Kal's men looked around nervously, and waited for instructions. They were completely out-numbered and out-gunned by Nokks, of all people. Kal convinced them that capturing these women would mean a big payoff, but he did not tell them that the women were allied to the Houses. </p>
<p>"This is not your concern!" Kal hissed, peering at the dark shadows left and right. "This is a matter between us!" he indicated pointing to Seven, B'Elanna, and himself.</p>
<p>"That is incorrect," the unflappable Borg informed him. "When you chose to threaten their champion, you challenged the bounds of their honor. You are not in control of this situation."</p>
<p>"Drop your weapons," Seven ordered Kal's men. "Resistance is FUTILE."</p>
<p>The clamor of weapons falling to the ground echoed through the neighborhood as Kal's men disarmed themselves, hoping to avoid retribution. A tall, brownish-redheaded Nokk came out of the darkness and went to B'Elanna. </p>
<p>"I am Mae'Nokk," he introduced himself respectfully.  "The Great LenNokk wishes you, our Champion, a pleasant evening. Do not concern yourselves any longer. We will take care of this...problem."</p>
<p>The burly warriors circled the Mewks, and took custody of the lowlife band, even as Kal's loud and annoying protests went unheeded. Then, the young Nokk bowed deeply to Seven before he joined the rest of his noble people as they receded back into the shadows. When he too disappeared into the night, they heard him murmur softly.</p>
<p>"My brother sends his regards, Champion...."</p>
