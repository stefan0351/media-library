<p><i>Sam POV</i></p>

<p>She walked the halls of Kennedy High with her head held high, her
shoulders back and her stride confident. </p>

<p>She felt like such a fraud. </p>

<p>Here she'd made this huge revelation to herself, but she
couldn't admit it to Brooke, who her revelation was (sort of) about.
Her thoughts, judging by that last sentence, were going in crazy
circles. </p>

<p>Actually, she was in the process of rectifying the Brooke situation.
She was trying to track the cheerleader down so as to get to the
bottom of the `avoiding' fiasco. But she wasn't having
much luck. Here it was, the end of the day, and she hadn't been able
to get Brooke alone. So, she reasoned, the only thing left to do was
wait and trap her at home. Eeexcellent! (Picture Mr Burns!)</p>

<p>Sam sat in her last class, Bio, and stared gloomily at her teacher,
Bio Glass. The `woman', and she used the term loosely, made
the class sit alphabetically, so Brooke had no choice but to sit next
to her for the duration. But even though they were forced to share a
biology table, Brooke was sitting as far away from Sam as possible,
looking as if she'd rather be licking Mary Cherry's webbed toes than
be sitting by Sam. Sam, for her part, was trying to sit as normally
as possible, which was hard considering she could almost sense the
hate vibes emanating from Brooke. It was making her feel physically
ill. </p>

<p>Sam sighed. She couldn't wait until they were home so she could put
operation "stop hating me, Brooke" into action. </p>

<p><i>Sam POV</i></p>

<p>It was 9pm on the dot. Tea had been a strained affair, neither girl
speaking nor looking at the other. Of course, they had acted the same
at every meal for the past 10 days!</p>

<p>Now, at 9pm, Sam was pacing the floor of her room, and waiting for
Brooke to come upstairs for bed. An ambush was in store for Brookie
dearest. </p>

<p>9.03. Brooke climbed the stairs reluctantly. She'd tried every
excuse
she could think of, but it was well known in her household that
Brooke McQueen went to bed at 9pm to perform her complicated beauty
routine and get plenty of beauty sleep. Brooke was anxious to avoid
Sam, but not so anxious that she would risk deviating from her set
routine and arousing suspicion. </p>

<p>9.04. Brooke reached her room. She looked around furtively, then
entered. </p>

<p>9.04 and a half. Sam pushed open the door to their adjoining
bathroom, hid behind the shower curtain and waited. </p>

<p>9.05. Brooke pushed open HER door to their bathroom, and walked over
to her sink. Running the cold tap, she splashed water on her face and
began her beauty routine. </p>

<p>9.07. Sam inched her way out from behind the curtain, making her face
visible an inch at a time to Brooke, who tensed. </p>

<p>9.08. Sam spoke. </p>

<p>"Why have you been avoiding me for so long, Brooke? What did I
do?"</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes glazed over in a look of what she hoped desperately
was blank disinterest. "Oh, I'm sorry," she mumbled dully. "I didn't
realize you were in here, I'll come back."</p>

<p>"No!" Sam stamped her foot. "I want to talk to you. I want to
understand this. Is it me? Do I need to up my dose of deodorant?"</p>

<p>This was a pathetic attempt at lightening to mood, and it almost
worked. Brooke's eyes lost that glazed sheen and she nearly smiled. </p>

<p>"No, it's not that" she whispered. </p>

<p>"Then what? Cos... I miss you," Sam finally admitted with a
rush of breath. She looked at the sinks, at the shower head, at her
shoes, anywhere but at Brooke. But out of the corner of her eye, in
the mirror she saw Brooke's face crumple up and then Sam watched the
blonde as she fled from the room in tears. Feeling terrible, Sam
followed her. </p>

<p>Brooke was sitting on her bed in the corner where the two walls met,
crying as if her heart would break. </p>

<p>"Brooke? I'm sorry, but I don't know what I'm sorry for. Can you tell
me why you're crying?" Sam said this in her gentlest voice, fearing
Brooke would run again. But for the first time in 10 days, Brooke
stayed put. And spoke. </p>

<p>"I'm crying because I've got something I need to tell
you, but I can't tell you. Cos, I would never want you to think less
of me,and I could certainly do without the exposé in the school
newspaper that'll be sure to follow."</p>

<p>Sam stared at her. Brooke, having said her piece, buried her head in
her arms and cried harder. </p>

<p>"Are you pregnant, Brooke?"</p>

<p>She shook her head mutely. </p>

<p>"Well, then what?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I can't. I just can't face your reaction."</p>

<p>Something in Sam's head was telling her to pursue this avenue, but
something was telling her that now was perfect confession time, and
boy was it time to fess up. </p>

<p>"Well, if you can't tell me yours, I'll just have to tell you mine.
Because let me tell you something, Brooke. I've been trying to track
you down for the last two days, to tell you something that's been on
my mind for months now, but you keep avoiding me. Since you don't
seem to be going anywhere now, I guess now's the time to tell
you..."</p>

<p>"Tell me what?" Brooke breathed, still crying but not as hard because
her attention was riveted on the brunette. </p>

<p>"Tell you... that I love you..." Sam let out with a burst of breath,
again trying to look anywhere but at the blonde. </p>

<p>Brooke's head snapped up in disbelief and anger. "How dare you," she
ground out. "How dare you read my diary and then openly mock me. Are
you even human at all?"</p>

<p>"What? Read your diary? - that's ridiculous, Brooke. I didn't even
know you kept a diary. I'm telling you the truth, the way I feel
about you. Wait a minute... mocking you? Do you mean you... love me,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Brooke sobbed. "But I know you would never feel the same way,
cos you're straight..."</p>

<p>"I think you've got that backwards, YOU'RE straight, I'M gay, I
thought..."</p>

<p>"Well obviously you thought wrong, because it would appear that we
love each other."</p>

<p>They both paused for breath, each looking at the other warily. Brooke
cracked first. Holding out her arms, she sniffled back fresh tears.
Sam was having trouble containing her own tears. They streamed down
her face as she walked towards Brooke on the bed. When she got there,
she climbed up on the bed and into Brooke's waiting arms. </p>
