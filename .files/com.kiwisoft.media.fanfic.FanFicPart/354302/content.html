<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 40: Growing families -->

<P>Convincing Chakotay that having Tach and Nara join the crew was much easier
than Kathryn had anticipated. She had thought that he would play Devil’s
advocate and have a dozen reasons why they shouldn’t add three more travelers to
<I>Voyager’s</I> manifest. One look at Chakotay’s expanding waistline and
Kathryn knew he was probably more impressed with Nara’s ability in the kitchen
than with Tach’s skill as an engineer or farmer. She couldn’t blame him; she had
been enjoying meals more with each passing day. Neelix had happily let Nara take
over his kitchen and been quite content to be the "chef’s assistant" while Nara
whipped up delicious creations. Janeway wondered if he would be as gracious now
that Nara was going to be staying. She hoped so. Nara’s herbed beef was one of
her favorites, and she couldn’t wait to taste what Nara would come up with for
the new fruit that was almost ready for harvesting. She hoped there was an apple
pie somewhere in her future.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Betoc had brought a beaten up shuttle to Tach, which thrilled Tom Paris. He
had taken one look at the sleek lines of the ship and then begged Tach to let
him help restore it. Betoc visited with his friends and finally left to help
with the evacuations. <I>Voyager</I> couldn’t do much to help so they continued
on toward the Alpha Quadrant and got back into the ship’s regular routine. The
first thing Janeway had to deal with was disciplining two crewmembers for
"inappropriate displays of affection."</P>
<P>"This isn’t the first time you’ve been warned about this particular type of
behavior, B’Elanna," Janeway said as she stood outside her ready room. "So, why
don’t you two start in here, and then completely strip and clean cargo bay two.
It’s gotten a bit run down since Seven stopped using it to regenerate every
day." </P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven nodded as the door opened. Janeway raised both eyebrows
and motioned them in, then went back to the bridge. Seven went in first and she
looked at the damage. All of the grief she had felt came rolling over her like a
wave, pushing her under the surface and threatening to drown her. She felt her
legs give out and B’Elanna grabbed her arm.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she asked as she moved around in front of the former drone. </P>
<P>Seven took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She let out a long sigh and
then opened her eyes to see B’Elanna staring at her with concern covering her
features. She smiled weakly at her Klingon wife.</P>
<P>"Seven? What just happened?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Being here…reminded me." Seven rested her hand on B’Elanna’s shoulder. "I
believe it just ‘caught up’ with me."</P>
<P>"Well, I’m here," B’Elanna said. "Now, shall we get started?" </P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she turned. She looked at what had been the ready
room and the Klingon’s knees went weak. "Kahless!" she exclaimed. "Was there a
decompression in here?" Her eyes were drawn to the conduit that had been ripped
from the wall and the bulkhead that was bent and twisted. She had only seen that
kind of damage from explosive decompressions or from photon torpedo impacts.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said quietly. She looked at the shredded remains of the couch and
felt shame filling her. </P>
<P>B’Elanna turned back to Seven. "Be’nal," she whispered and took her taller
lover into her arms. "I would do anything to take this pain away from you."</P>
<P>"You already have," Seven answered. "You came home to me." She squeezed
B’Elanna, inhaling her scent and burying her face in her satiny hair.</P>
<P>"And I always will," B’Elanna said into Seven’s chest.</P>
<P>"In the future, I will not allow you to go alone," Seven said as she stepped
back. "Now, we should begin. I believe our task will not take long."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and turned to the destroyed room. "Love, I don’t even know
where to start."</P>
<P>"I believe we will need to collect and recycle the …damaged materials…and
then replicate replacements," Seven said logically.</P>
<P>"Seven, my beloved," B’Elanna shook her head. "It would take a full
engineering team at least a day to put a dent in this."</P>
<P>"I believe there are enough dents in it now," Seven said. She looked at her
wife innocently, then smirked, letting her know that she was teasing her. "As
for the repairs, I do not think it will take long at all." Seven walked to the
comm panel near the door. It was one of the few remaining things that were
undamaged. </P>
<P>"Oh?" B’Elanna said. She folded her arms and leaned against the wall. "Do
Borg have some magical abilities that I don’t know about?"</P>
<P>Seven paused and then leered at B’Elanna. "You have experienced almost all of
my…magical abilities…or have you forgotten the ‘wow’ phenomenon?"</P>
<P>"As wonderful as your skills are…I don’t think that will help us right now."
B’Elanna rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked as she scanned the room with her Borg enhanced
eyepiece. She turned to the console and held her hand out to it. Her tubules
appeared and then plunged into the control panel. The debris began beaming out
and after a few moments, the room was empty.</P>
<P>"Impressive," B’Elanna said with a smile. "But even if you can beam in the
replacements… we don’t have that many replicator rations between us."</P>
<P>"We have the additional rations from the time we were on Jusari Prime. The
captain decided to give us rations based on our time…not <I>Voyager’s</I>,"
Seven said. "I was not going to mention it until after the baby. I wanted to
surprise you." She looked across the room as she used the direct interface with
the console to send the commands and the new items began appearing.</P>
<P>"You rat," B’Elanna said as she moved closer to her wife and wrapped her arm
around her waist. "Oh, and I don’t think this was the punishment Janeway had in
mind."</P>
<P>"As you are so fond of saying…what she doesn’t know, won’t hurt her." Seven
smiled. "I am beaming in a replacement bulkhead section… we will have to install
that manually."</P>
<P>"I think I can live with that," B’Elanna said happily. "Got any tricks up
your sleeve to clean the cargo bay?"</P>
<P>"Of course." Seven’s smile widened. "And then we can return to our quarters
and I can… finish what Tuvok interrupted."</P>
<P>"I love the way you think." B’Elanna kissed Seven’s cheek. "Just don’t tell
the captain."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn returned to the bridge after a late lunch and went to check on her
ready room. She expected to find B’Elanna and Seven hard at work. She entered,
and was stunned to see the room finished, but not just finished, it was perfect,
right down to Kathryn’s lucky teacup. She walked over and picked up the fragile
item, only then seeing tiny repaired cracks. There was a data padd next to it,
so she picked it up. It was from Seven, and it explained that she had been
forced to replicate the teacup because Kathryn’s had been too badly damaged. She
added a few repaired cracks to remind Kathryn of the time they had shared. Seven
thanked Kathryn for ‘holding her together’ when her entire universe had fallen
apart. It was an unexpected gift, and Kathryn decided that the new cup was
certainly much luckier than its predecessor had been.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven hurried through the corridor toward their quarters. They
had finished cleaning the cargo bay in less than twenty minutes. B’Elanna had
been shocked when Seven showed her how she had kept the vast room so pristine.
Seven had taken a few minutes to put things into their proper places, stepped
into the corridor with B’Elanna, and then activated a program, "Seven of Nine
cleaning protocol one." The cargo transporter activated and beamed every
non-equipment particle into a refuse container. The entire process took only a
few minutes. B’Elanna found the entire process fascinating, and it gave her
insight into her wife’s thought process. She then concentrated on getting back
to their quarters.</P>
<P>"Stop it," B’Elanna said when Seven’s hand brushed across her leg a bit too
close to her thigh.</P>
<P>"I assure you, my contact was inadvertent," Seven said with a wicked
smirk.</P>
<P>"Right," B’Elanna said, not believing her for a moment. "We’re almost
home…just be patient. I don’t want the captain giving us any more projects."</P>
<P>"I will comply," Seven said unhappily.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Nara yelled from the far end of the corridor.</P>
<P>"Damn," the Klingon whispered. "We were so close," she said as she looked at
their door less than ten paces away. "Nara, what can we do for you?"</P>
<P>Seven stopped and crossed her arms over her chest and let out a frustrated
sigh.</P>
<P>"I take it I’m interrupting?" Nara asked as she studied Seven. After living
with the hot-blooded couple on the planet for a year, she could tell when Seven
had <I>plans</I> for B’Elanna, though it didn’t stop her from interfering. In
fact, she rather enjoyed tormenting the lanky blonde.</P>
<P>Seven started to answer, but B’Elanna reached out and squeezed her hand. "Of
course not. What can we do for you?"</P>
<P>"Actually, Tach and I would like to do something for you," Nara
explained.</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven asked. She looked over at her friend and tilted her head. "We
are pleased that you will be joining the crew. We should be giving you a
welcoming gift."</P>
<P>"Nonsense." Nara shook her head. "I know that you two are married, but Tach
and I would like to sponsor you in a bonding ceremony. You’re family now, so
it’s only right."</P>
<P>"Bonding?" B’Elanna asked suspiciously. "Does it involve a sweathouse?"</P>
<P>"Great goddess, no." Nara shook her head and laughed. "The ways of the
goddess are very clear. Only couples who are sacred bound can invite another
couple into the great rite. The ceremony will recognize the unique bond you
already share and ask the great goddess to bless it."</P>
<P>"You would do this for us?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Of course, you long-legged fool," Nara answered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked up at Seven and they both smiled. "Well," B’Elanna said, "as
long as it doesn’t involve any sweating rituals… we’d love to."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Nara said as she hugged B’Elanna. The Klingon resisted at first
but then returned the embrace with enthusiasm. Nara was family after all. Nara
then moved to Seven. "You won’t regret it. The goddess will guide and bless you
and the baby." She hugged Seven and then eased back and smiled. "Now, off to bed
with you."</P>
<P>"It is nowhere near out bedtime," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"Like that’s ever stopped you two," Nara said as she walked away.</P>
<P>"Come on, Be’nal. You’ve waited long enough." B’Elanna said opened their
door. She took Seven’s hand and tugged her into their quarters. "Now…what did
you have in mind when you were mauling me in the conference room?"</P>
<P>"I shall show you," Seven said with a growl. She picked B’Elanna up and
carried her to their small table in the dining area and sat her on the
transparent surface. She buried her hands in B’Elanna’s hair and gently kissed
her eyes, then her cheeks and finally moved to her lips. The kiss deepened and
Seven eased her wife onto her back. A quick flick of her Borg enhanced wrist and
the front of B’Elanna’s tunic was shredded.</P>
<P>"I love it when you get impatient," B’Elanna said with a growl. She felt the
cool air on her skin and her nipples grew rigid as Seven tore her bra off and
began kissing her chest. "Oh yes, Seven, that," she whispered. Seven’s lips
wrapped around the rosy bud and drew it into her mouth. Seven smiled when her
wife began growling loudly.</P>
<P>"Do you like that?" Seven asked as she moved her mouth to the other side.</P>
<P>"Oh…yes," B’Elanna yelled when Seven clamped down on her nipple.</P>
<P>"So do I," Seven volunteered. She moaned as she lovingly caressed her wife’s
nipple with her hand while her mouth feasted on the other. She carefully raked
her teeth over the sensitive jewel, growling when B’Elanna whimpered. She
quickly brought her tongue out to soothe the tender flesh. "My beautiful
Be’nal," she whispered. "I thought I would never make love to you again." She
moved back up and kissed B’Elanna deeply, reverently, and let all of her love
pour through the meeting of their lips.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna promised when Seven pulled back to take a gulp of
air.</P>
<P>"I know," Seven said. She smiled and began nipping at B’Elanna’s graceful
neck. Her lips and teeth covered every inch, careful not to leave any bit of
skin unloved.</P>
<P>"More," B’Elanna said with pleading sigh. "I need you."</P>
<P>"Then you shall have me," Seven whispered into her lover’s ear, using the
moment to gently nibble on her earlobe.</P>
<P>Seven’s hand moved down to her wife’s waist and tugged off her trousers and
panties in one yank. She moaned as her fingers tested the wetness. "You feel so
good, my Be’nal," Seven whispered as her mouth left a trail of kisses down to
B’Elanna’s stomach.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sucked in a deep breath and her body shook. Seven paused to look
behind her for the chair. She pulled it to her and sat, then lifted B’Elanna’s
legs over her shoulders and began drawing her Klingon toward her.</P>
<P>"I missed my lunch," Seven said as she nipped at B’Elanna’s caramel toned
thigh.</P>
<P>"Lucky me," B’Elanna said with a laugh.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she nipped the opposite thigh. "Lucky me."</P>
