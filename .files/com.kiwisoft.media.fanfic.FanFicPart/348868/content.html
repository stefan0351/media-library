<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 16 - Decisions-->

<P>B'Elanna's body filled with a warmth she hadn't felt in a long time. Seven's
embrace felt dreamy. B'Elanna took Seven's hand from around her waist and
brought it to her mouth. Kissing the back of Seven's fully human hand, B'Elanna
remembered what it felt like to be held lovingly. Only this was Seven of Nine,
not Claire. B'Elanna knew that the Borg was only trying to stop her from balling
her eyes out. B'Elanna then realised the inappropriateness of holding Seven's
hand to her mouth and quickly let go. </P>
<P>"Sorry, I was thinking of someone else." B'Elanna apologised., sniffling back
a tear. A knife dug deeply into Seven's heart. The pain shot through her once
again, even worse than when B'Elanna had cried out her lover's name. </P>
<P>"I sometimes get like that you know, daydreaming and all." B'Elanna
continued, hoping Seven wouldn't be upset at the intimate contact. </P>
<P>"Apology accepted." Seven swallowed hard, holding back the hurt and removed
her left arm from around B'Elanna's waist. </P>
<P>"Good." B'Elanna said, standing up and turning to see Seven with her head
down. B'Elanna concluded that the kiss had upset Seven more than she was letting
on. So the Lieutenant decided to change the subject.</P>
<P>"Ooh, stupid me." B'Elanna scolded herself. "We really have to clean that
wound now, or else it's gonna get infected." </P>
<P>"Very well." Seven responded, not lifting her head.</P>
<P>"Okay, how do you want to do this?" B'Elanna asked, not wanting to bring up
the inevitable.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed. "I believe you should remove my bio-suit, so you can better
clean the wound." Seven stated, her voice almost cracking.</P>
<P>B'Elanna blushed intensely, even though she knew it was coming. "Well, not
the whole suit right?" B'Elanna offered.</P>
<P>"You are correct, only the top need be removed." Seven tried to ease the
obviously flustered Lieutenant. </P>
<P>"Great." B'Elanna said sarcastically. </P>
<P>"You can start by unzipping the suit at the base of my neck." Seven
explained, turning around painfully.</P>
<P>"Okay." Was all B'Elanna could say, with her heart racing, body tingling and
knees almost buckling. "So I just unzip it here?" B'Elanna brought her shaking
hand to Seven's neck. </P>
<P>"Yes." Seven said nervously. The Borg was beginning to feel uncomfortable at
the prospect of B'Elanna viewing her nakedness. Although she had never had a
problem with being naked before, the possibility that the Lieutenant would
disapprove of her form disturbed her. </P>
<P>"Okay, here I go. You ready?" B'Elanna asked hesitantly.</P>
<P>"Yes." Seven swallowed and closed her eyes. B'Elanna slowly unzipped the
bio-suit with her right hand, using her left hand to unwrap Seven's soft
shoulders. Carefully, B'Elanna removed the suit around the wound, her hand
accidentally touching Seven's breast as it bounced free. The touch sent shock
waves through Seven's body.</P>
<P>"Sorry." B'Elanna apologised. I can't believe I did that again, B'Elanna said
to herself while pounding her forehead.</P>
<P>"There is no need to apologise Lieutenant." Seven responded, breathing a
little harder. </P>
<P>"Thanks, it's just that I never imagined I'd be living out Harry's fantasy."
B'Elanna joked, hoping to ease the tension.</P>
<P>"You are correct." Seven stated.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna asked, confused.</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim's fantasy does include undressing me or me undressing myself."
Seven responded, knowing B'Elanna would be shocked.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna shouted, eyes wide open.</P>
<P>"When I was upgrading holo-deck 1, I was able to watch several interesting
holo-programs play out." Seven stated nonchalantly.</P>
<P>"You broke into our private holo-programs." B'Elanna shouted. "How could
you?" B'Elanna turned Seven around, holding her by the arms.</P>
<P>"I did not purposely break into anyone's private collection." Seven said
defensively.</P>
<P>"Then what happened?" B'Elanna held Seven's arms even tighter, while looking
straight into her eyes.</P>
<P>"While upgrading the systems, I found someone had already broken into Ensign
Kim's private collection, as well as some other members of the crew." Seven
explained.</P>
<P>"Other members?" B'Elanna asked, eager to know if she was one of them.</P>
<P>"Yes. But I do not think I should disclose any of those other members." Seven
answered.</P>
<P>"Why not? You just told me Harry's fantasy!" B'Elanna complained. </P>
<P>"I was attempting to lighten the mood, just as you were." Seven
responded.</P>
<P>"So lighten it even more, tell me who else got hacked into." B'Elanna pushed,
closing in on Seven's personal space. </P>
<P>"If you are worried that your collection was hacked into, you need not
worry." Seven assured.</P>
<P>"Thank you." B'Elanna breathed a sigh of relief, and lowered her head, right
into Seven's ample bosom. The soft, tender, white flesh took B'Elanna by
surprise. The half-Klingon's face was buried in between Seven's wonderful
breasts, and B'Elanna couldn't move. </P>
<P>Seven was equally frozen at the contact. She could feel B'Elanna's lips
softly pressed against the inside of her breasts, but not kissing them. Seven's
head spun and her knees weakened. B'Elanna noticed Seven losing balance, as the
breasts her face was pressed against fell away from her. Quickly reaching her
arms out, B'Elanna caught Seven and laid her down gently. The Lieutenant walked
over to her Starfleet jacket and picked it up to place it underneath Seven's
head. </P>
<P>Seven's fainting spell had saved them from an extremely awkward moment of
conversation. Although, B'Elanna knew she had some explaining to do when Seven
woke up. But now, the Lieutenant was more worried about the wound on Seven's
shoulder. Cupping her hands together, B'Elanna reached over to the waterfall and
collected some water, then poured it onto Seven's wound, washing away some of
the blood. </P>
<P>After repeatedly washing away blood, B'Elanna looked around for something to
tie off the wound, and saw nothing. Then she remembered that her silk panties
were underneath the water. As embarrassing as it was, B'Elanna forced herself to
swallow her pride. So she reached under the water, picked up her panties and
wringed them out. After carefully tying her underwear around Seven's shoulder,
B'Elanna sat back exhausted, more emotionally than physically. </P>
<P>Closing her eyes, B'Elanna thought of all the events in the past few days
that had led up to this moment. The amazingly civil conversation the two had in
the mess hall. The way Seven held her in the cold of night, keeping her from
freezing to death. The way Parker sucked up to her by getting those alien
apples. And the way that the two had failed in finding Parker. No, the way she
alone had failed. B'Elanna knew that she was in charge, and that she, not Seven
was to blame for Parker's disappearance. </P>
<P>After all, if she had been more civil to Seven during their attempt to
contact Voyager, Parker would have never ran off to the apple patch. Now she had
to choose between staying by Seven's side or going off alone to find their
missing team member.</P>
