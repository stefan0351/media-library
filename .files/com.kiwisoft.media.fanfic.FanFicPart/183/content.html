<!-- Who's That Girl \ Prologue -->

<p>They day started out normal enough as two best friends casually walked
around the campus of their new school avoiding meeting their new roomates
for as long as possible. "I really can't believe we don't get to share a
dorm room Will. That's so unfair." Buffy sighed as she carelessly tossed the
key to her new dorm room in the air over and over again.</p>

<p>"It can't be that bad, can it? Or what if my roomate doesn't like me? Or
what if she snores really loud and keeps me up at night?" Willow asked in a
panicy voice and Buffy grabbed her hand to stop her.</p>

<p>"Your right, it won't be bad Wills. I just always thought it would be neat
to kind of live with you," Buffy said with a smile. "I guess we should go
check out our rooms huh?" Willow nodded and Buffy linked arms with her
friend and led the way.</p>

<p>After a few minutes they arrived at the hall where the dorms were and Buffy
walked Willow to her room before heading off to find her own. When she saw
that her room was only a few rooms down the hall from Willow's she smiled to
herself.  She slowly entered the room and was relieved when she found that
her roomate hadn't arrived yet. After tossing her small duffel bag on the
floor between the two small beds Buffy took a moment to walk around the room
and give it furter inspection. "Well this is boring," Buffy spoke to herself
as she layed on one of the beds to wait for her roomate to arrive.</p>

<hr>

<p>"So tell me again just why you chose to come to this school when you could
have gotten into way better schools and continued cheerleading?" Les asked
as he pulled another of his friends suitcases from the back of his car.</p>

<p>"I wanted to get away from the city and just be somewhere relaxing. This is
a cute little town. Besides, I'm not a real cheerleader anyways. I was just
helping out last year to save your butts," Missy said with a smile as she
picked up her bags.</p>

<p>"Let me help you with that stuff. I'll walk you to your room," Les offered
but as he went to reach for one of her bags Missy swatted his hand away.</p>

<p>"You've got to get going though. Your flight leaves tonight and you've
still got to get home and get your stuff together. I'll be fine Les," Missy
gave him a hug and shooed him back into his car. "Besides, I can get one of
those cute guys over there to help me out if I need it," Missy smirked at
her friend who turned his attention to the group of guys she had been
looking at. When she saw the smile grow on Les' face she reached in the car
and covered his eyes. "These are my cute guys, you go find your own
somewhere else."</p>

<p>Les let out a small laugh and gave her hand a soft squeeze. "I'll give you
a call when I get settled in at school," he said. "So since you've got
everything you need I guess I'll get out of here now. Take care of
yourself."</p>

<p>Missy leaned down into the car and gave him a kiss on the cheek. "Sure
thing," she said softly as she closed his car door.  She walked back to
where her bags were and gathered them up in her arms clumsily as she watched
her friend drive off. Once she spotted where the dorm rooms were she made
her way to the room quickly and set her stuff down when she stood outside of
her room. Her arms felt weak from carrying all her bags by herself and after
fumbling around in her pockets for a minute she found the key to her room
and walked in dragging her belongings behind her.</p>

<p>The first thing she noticed was a blonde girl sleeping on one of the beds
and smiled. At least her roomate looked normal enough. Making sure not to
wake the girl yet she quietly put her things on the other side of the room
and sat down on the other bed debating if she should wake the girl up or
not.</p>

<p>Finally she decided she would wake her up since she was starting to get
bored of just watching her sleep. She got up to walk over the the bed and
gently tapped the girl on the shoulder. "Wake up roomie," she said as she
kept nudging the girl. Finally the girl opened her eyes sleepily and Missy
noticed her face pale. "Faith?" The girl asked and Missy just looked at her
curiously.</p>

<p>Before she even knew what was happening Missy found herself pinned
underneath a very pissed off blonde. "What the hell are you doing?" she
yelled at her roomate.</p>

<p>"Me? What the hell do you want Faith?" Buffy asked, now fully awake.</p>

<p>"Who the hell is Faith? I'm Missy, your roomate." Buffy continued to stare
down at her for a minute not believing her but finally she relented and got
up off the bed.</p>

<p>"Your Missy, not Faith?" Buffy questioned, suddenly very confused.</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Oh God," Buffy whispered softly as she started to wonder how this girl
could look exactly like her once friend. "Can we maybe try this again? I'm
Buffy by the way," she said as she held out her hand to her new roomate.
Missy shook her hand and gave her a confused look.</p>

<p>"Nice to meet you Buffy. Now do you mind telling me what the hell that was
all about?" Missy asked. Buffy nodded and sat back down on the bed next to
the girl. 'This is going to be a long year,' she silently thought to
herself.</p>
