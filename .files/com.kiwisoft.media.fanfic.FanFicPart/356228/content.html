<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Three -->

<p>I can count all the times I've been absolutely terrified in my life
on one hand and still have a few fingers left over. There was the
time my mother died, the time Barbara took me in, and the time Dinah
came into my world and decided to change things. Two weeks ago I
added another instance of being absolutely terrified and that's when
I realized Dinah had been shot.</p>
<p>Barbara insists that none of it was my fault but she wasn't there so
she just doesn't know better. I was too slow. With all this
superhuman speed and agility I was too slow to stop that idiot from
shooting Dinah. I don't know if even Dinah realizes how close she
came to getting...well getting shot worse. I don't know what Supreme
Being was looking out for her that night, I don't know what made her
roll one way instead of another but she did and the bullet only
grazed her side. If she had just moved the other way then I don't
know how well off she'd be right now.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn't take responsibility from what happened but it's
hard not to. It's very hard not to. It wasn't entirely my fault. I
know this. I know that we risk our lives every night and we both
accept the risk of being mortally injured but I don't like having to
accept that when it comes to Dinah.</p>
<p>When she was fully recovered I wanted to tell her that she was no
longer allowed to go out on sweeps. I wanted to tell her that she was
no longer allowed to risk her life, but I knew that she'd just hate
me more if I did and I don't want her to hate me anymore than she
already does. Plus, risking her life for other's is just who she is.
I could probably no more demand she change that than I could demand
Barbara to actually let someone into her heart a little. Am I just
completely useless around here?</p>
<p>Oh no wait. I'm good for something. It would seem that I'm actually
very good at being a punching bag for Dinah. She wants to get better.
I can certainly understand that. Part of her working out so much is
probably due to the fact that she doesn't ever want to come that
close to death again. I even support her learning to be even more
careful than she already is, but I don't want her to work too hard.</p>
<p>She's pushing her powers to the limit now. It seems like she can do
something new everyday and while that's really great I can tell that
it's draining her. Barbara has tried to get her slow down but Dinah
isn't even listening to her and I know how much that's affecting
Barbara now. They were getting so close then Dinah just...well she just
kind of shut the door on all of us.</p>
<p>We had gotten so far. We had gotten so damn far and then Dinah just
decides we've gone far enough without consulting any of us, without
consulting me. She was the friend that I turned to when I needed to
talk about what was going on in my life. I mean, sure I could still
talk to Barbara but it wasn't the same because with Barbara we
weren't on the same level. She was my mentor, she was the teacher and
that's how it would always be.</p>
<p>With Dinah we were sort of equal. Sure I had more experience than her
and my general knowledge of the whole superhero edge was broader but
still...we were kind of equal. I trusted her. I still do trust her but
I don't think she trusts me. She doesn't want to be near me anymore.
She is always pulling herself away. She's built a nice wall up around
herself to keep everyone and everything out and I don't know how to
break it down.</p>
<p>I wonder if she'll ever figure out that she had sort of become my
hero and now I was watching her fall. It's always hard to watch the
hero fall.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Barbara asks as she joins me as I look
up into the night sky.</p>
<p>"What do you think?"</p>
<p>She only nods her head. She knows what I'm thinking about because
she's been thinking about the same thing. "She'll come around."</p>
<p>"You've been saying that for two weeks now and the only change I see
is Dinah getting stronger and faster and pulling further away."</p>
<p>"If she goes on like she is then we'll confront her. I still have
hope that she'll realize what's happening and will just come to us.
She has in the past."</p>
<p>"I just want her back." I whisper softly.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Barbara sighs, "so do I."</p>
<p>That's when Dinah decides to join us. She knows we've been talking
about her but she doesn't say anything about it. We stand there all
together looking out at the city and up at the sky. There's a peace
here. Even with Dinah's situation the peace remains.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Delphi alert goes off and Barbara and I turn to go back
into the clock tower. Duty calls. Duty always seems to call. As we
leave I can barely even hear Dinah whisper into the night, "I want to
come back too." She then just turns and follows Barbara and me to
the computers.</p>
<p>"It's Reese." Barbara says when we are both by her side.</p>
<p>I really don't want to deal with Reese right now. But what choice do
I really have. "Fine, I'm on my way." I turn to Dinah. "Do you want
to come with me?"</p>
<p>I can see that Barbara wants to object. She doesn't think Dinah is
ready to hit the streets again, but I know that if I can just get
Dinah to come with me...I make myself believe that if Dinah just comes
with me then everything will be okay. I hope to make Barbara believe
it too. For that matter, I hope to make Dinah believe it as well.</p>
<p>"So are you coming?" I ask again when I get no answer.</p>
<p>Dinah looks to Barbara for approval but Barbara just looks at her
computer screens. I'm sure she thinks this has to be Dinah's
decision.</p>
<p>"I'll go."</p>
<p>Thank God. She's going to go. "Well alright then get ready." Dinah
smiles, the first real smile I've seen from her in a while, and runs
up stairs to change.</p>
<p>"I hope that whatever you have planned works, Helena. I really do."
Barbara tells me still focusing on her screens. She hides behind
those screens sometimes.</p>
<p>"You're not the only one."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Reese has another suspicious death so he gave me a call. That's all
he really calls me for anymore. That's all I allow him to call me
for. With Dinah acting like she has been I've been reacting by going
further into my own little shell. It would seem that if Dinah isn't
happy then I'm not happy. If Dinah hides away then I have to hide
away too. That's kind of weird actually. I wonder why that is.</p>
<p>It isn't something I should be thinking about now though. I have a
dead body in front of me and there's always work to do.</p>
<p>"So what can you tell us?" I ask Reese. He looks over at me then
turns his gaze to Dinah. I get the feeling he kind of wished she
wasn't here. For some reason, he always gets tense around her. I'm
guessing it's from knowing that his father killed her mother, but
that's really only my guess. I can see how that could breed
awkwardness though.</p>
<p>"Well, from what the witness told us this guy was jumped by a lizard."</p>
<p>"Lizard?" Dinah steps closer and looks over the body.</p>
<p>"Yeah, some lizard apparently spit something at the guy and uh...my
guess would be it was poisonous."</p>
<p>"So we're dealing with some poisonous lizard man?" I ask stepping
closer to Dinah to look down at the body.</p>
<p>"Get a sample of the poison for me if you can," Oracle tells me. "If
I can analyze I can probably come up with an antidote."</p>
<p>"Yes ma'am." I pull out a vial that I keep in my jacket, for just
such an occasion and bend down over the body.</p>
<p>"What do you think you're doing?" Reese asks grabbing my arm. "We
can't tamper with the scene."</p>
<p>"Oracle wants a sample so that she can find an antidote so that when
one of us gets attack by this guy, which is inevitable and even more
inevitable that it'll be you, we-meaning you-won't die." Wow Dinah's
got some bite to her tonight. I kind of like it.</p>
<p>Reese looks at me like he's expecting me to say something to Dinah,
but I'm not going to. Dinah's right. Of the three of us, Reese is the
most likely to be attacked by this guy and not because he's going to
be any more exposed to lizard man than we are, but just because he's
well...he's not meta.</p>
<p>After a short staring contest Reese lets go of my arm and I proceed
to take a sample of the poison that is on the man's skin. I take a
closer look at our victim and I fail to come up with a name. I've
never seen him before, which isn't too odd. I actually consider
myself lucky if I recognize the dead person. That's sounds kind of
strange maybe I should rephrase that. It's always a tragedy when I
recognize the victim but at least we have something to go on if I
know them. Usually, I know some place to start the investigation.
There's no starting from scratch.</p>
<p>"Do you recognize him?" Dinah asks me after, I guess, I've been
looking at the body for too long.</p>
<p>"No," I shake my head, "I've never seen him before."</p>
<p>"Well that's a good thing." She smiles at me and I can't help but
smile back. I knew taking her out tonight would be a good thing,
especially after what I heard her say at the clock tower. I know she
wants to get back to how it used to be. Dinah's not the type to
remain silent, stoic, and broody. That's kind of my job already.</p>
<p>"Are you done?" Reese calls from above us.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I tear my eyes from Dinah. "I've got what I needed." I hold
up the vial for him to see then put it back in my coat safe and sound
for Oracle to examine, test, manipulate, and do whatever else she
deems fit. "We should probably be going now, though. Still need to
protect the city from the scum and the miscreants."</p>
<p>I don't know why but this makes Dinah laugh. I'm happy she's
laughing. "Uh yeah, but before you go," Reese tears my attention once
again from Dinah, "can I talk to you alone."</p>
<p>I don't get a chance to answer. "Huntress go ahead. I'll just uh...
start the sweep without you. I'm sure you can catch up. I know you've
been keeping in shape." Dinah smiles then begins walking away from
us. She joked with me. I missed that. I want to follow her now. I
don't fully trust her to be alone, not because I don't trust her I
just don't trust anyone else but Reese has already begun to talk and
I really should be listening to him.</p>
<p>"...Know that you're distracted." He's looking at me like he's
expecting an answer but it's always difficult to answer someone when
you don't even know the question.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry. I need to take care of Dinah now." I hope this
answer satisfies his need for an answer. It seems to fit the
word 'distraction'.</p>
<p>"When are you going to start taking care of yourself?"</p>
<p>Well it seems like my answer was the right one or at least it fit the
question. "When she's better then I'll be fine. I'm sorry I've got to
go now." And before he can say another word I'm gone.</p>
<p>It doesn't take me that long to locate Dinah. She's only a few blocks
away and she's already kicking some poor soul's ass. I'm sure he
deserved it though. Especially since there's two very frightened
individuals standing back watching Dinah pound on their assailant.</p>
<p>Oh look there's another one. He's trying to sneak up behind her, but
I'm there before he even comes close enough to throw one punch. I'm
not going to let anyone ever hurt her again. I can't let her be hurt
again.</p>
<p>The man goes flying into the side of a building and is knocked out.
He's not going to be getting back up. I turn around and notice that
Dinah is now asking the would-be victims if they're alright. The
first time I saw her do that kind of surprised me. I always just
figured the person didn't get robbed, maimed, or hurt in any way then
they were okay and I could move on. If the person was hurt then I
made sure there was an ambulance, but I never tried to help them out
after I saved them.</p>
<p>If they were too scared then Dinah would actually walk them home. If
they were just bleeding slightly then she'd actually tend to their
wounds. She didn't just walk away. She got involved. She cared more
than I ever even considered caring. I was often more concerned with
letting my anger out on some guy who deserved an ass kicking.</p>
<p>"Is everything okay?" I can't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Dinah answers for the pair of still wide-eyed and frightened
girls. "You should really be more careful with who you choose to hang
around." They both look at her then turn their eyes to me. I'm not
too sure whether I should be offended or not.</p>
<p>Dinah smiles for what seems like the tenth time tonight and turns to
look at me. "Oh she's harmless. Nothing but a big harmless kitten."</p>
<p>I raise my brow in response but choose not to make any comment. The
girl does wonders for my reputation. I don't think the girls she's
talking to believe Dinah though. At least they don't look like they
do. But then again, I'm not too sure I'd find someone who jumped off
a building and rammed a man into a wall entirely harmless either.</p>
<p>The girls thank us both once again and then go on with their lives,
as everything should be. Dinah waves to them as they depart then
turns her attention to me.</p>
<p>"Big harmless kitten, huh?" I ask stepping closer to her.</p>
<p>"Yep." She answers flippantly then turns her back to me and starts to
walk away. I stand behind her in shock then shake my head and catch
up to her. I don't know what's gotten into her tonight, but I am very
happy to see that she at least seems to be less morbid than she has
been lately. It's really unfortunate that I know this won't last.
I've only offered her a quick fix. The only way things will get back
to the way they are is if she actually starts talking to Barbara or
myself.</p>
<p>"So what's on the agenda tonight?" She asks me as we walk languidly
down the street.</p>
<p>"I was hoping we could talk?"</p>
<p>Her eyes instantly grow dark and I know I've ruined the night. I've
ruined the chance for her and I to just get out and have fun. I've
ruined our chance to forget, just for a little while that we have
some pretty deep emotional problems that seem to cripple us every
once and a while. But hey, I had to open my mouth. I just couldn't go
on and let the night happen. Fuck me and caring.</p>
<p>"What do you want to talk about?"</p>
<p>Oh hey, she didn't shut me out completely. She's actually giving me
hope that we can talk about something tonight. There are no promises
but at least there's hope. I can live with hope. I can work with
hope.</p>
<p>"I want to talk about what happened that night."</p>
<p>Dinah heaves a big sigh then throws her hand up in the air. "What's
there to talk about? I was shot. I didn't die. It's over."</p>
<p>I just now notice we've stopped walking but for some reason I still
feel like I'm moving. Maybe that's because my head is spinning. I'm
so not in my element here. I'm good at hitting things. I'm not good
at touchy feely conversations especially when my goal is to get
someone else to talk about their feelings.</p>
<p>So okay where to start? What do I say first? "That night scared me
too. I thought maybe you'd be gone forever and I really didn't like
that thought at all." Honesty is always good, right?</p>
<p>"You were scared?"</p>
<p>"Hell yeah. I was fucking terrified. I don't want to lose you." I
stumbled over my words. "You're the only real partner I've had and
well...I don't want to lose you."</p>
<p>Is she crying? Did I say something wrong? Something right? I don't
know what I'm doing. I'm just standing here in the middle of the
night trying my best to help save a person who means more to me than
I think I ever realized. I'm trying to bring my best friend back.</p>
<p>"I don't want to die." She chokes out. "But I don't want you or
Barbara to think I'm weak either."</p>
<p>"Dinah, I'd never think that. I think you're stronger than either of
us. You put your life, heart, and soul on the line all the time. I
can't do that. I really admire you so much for that. You're one of
the strongest women I've ever had the privilege of meeting."</p>
<p>"Really?" She's drying her tears with the back of her hand and I can
no longer hold back my urge to hold her. I need to comfort her. This
is yet another thing I don't understand, but it's also something I'm
not going to fight.</p>
<p>"You're my hero, Dinah." I whisper to her.</p>
<p>"You're my hero too," I hear Barbara say. I almost forgot that she
could still hear us. I'm kind of glad she didn't miss out on this
conversation.</p>
