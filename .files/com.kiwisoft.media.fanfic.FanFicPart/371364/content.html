<p><b>DEAREST SISTER:</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Miley's fingers brushed behind my ear as I ambled alongside her. My strides were stiff and my limbs were still painful to use even after two days of convalescence in Miley's care. I had said one day was all I needed, but the fatigue and fragility remained and I could hardly stand yesterday. I was a helpless puppy. Miley had redressed my wounds when they became soaked with blood and spent many hours conversing with me, listening to me, or just sitting silently by my side, watching the lake. She apologised to me a lot all day yesterday. She would stare at a healing wound and whisper, "I'm so sorry this happened."</p>
<p>And each time her expression darkened, I'd slide an arm around her shoulders and draw her close, reassuring her quietly that it wasn't her fault.</p>
<p>She'd smile and wrap her arms around my waist, doing her best to avoid the still sore areas. Once I changed into my wolf form, I wouldn't be able to change back until I was fully healed because the constant expanding of my skin would keep my wounds from scabbing over. They would reopen with every change. I explained this to Miley and she was totally sweet about it. She asked questions without disgust, wanting to know what it felt like to be part animal, wanting to know how exactly I came to be such a creature. She soothed me when I said anything self-ridiculing and the fact she could love me regardless of what I was, made me adore the girl more than I previously had.</p>
<p>I always had faith that Miley's nature would kick in during my banishment. I prayed that her kind heart and accepting ways would get the better of her and she'd seek me out, which she did. And thinking I had hurt Blue Jeans and killed her animals was a valid assumption. I mean, I was covered in blood and Miley was hysterical at the time. She reacted like any human would.</p>
<p>We arrived at Miley's house and I was feeling worn out, unable to continue. I'd strained myself so much on the day Oliver attacked, unlocked energy and power I never knew I had and it left me utterly drained. I lowered to the ground and whined.</p>
<p>"Come on, Lilly. We're almost there," Miley encouraged, but all I managed to do was roll onto my side feebly. Miley knelt down and stroked my face, telling me to stay put. I nodded and she rose, jogging up to her front door and calling out for her dad.</p>
<p>The man emerged quickly, but faltered when he saw me sprawled before him.</p>
<p>"She's pretty big," he noted and I almost felt amused at the insinuation. I so wasn't fat...</p>
<p>"It means more protection for me," Miley defended, smiling at me and nudging her dad closer to me. "Go on, she won't bite."</p>
<p>Robbie positioned himself behind me and crouched down. He muttered "you better <i>not </i>bite" as he wedged his hands underneath me and hoisted me up into his arms. I whimpered when my front leg was jostled, earning a concerned look from Miley as she walked alongside her dad, making sure he was handling me gently.</p>
<p>"Where do you want her?" he asked.</p>
<p>"My room."</p>
<p>"Dang it!" Robbie complained and Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"Don't be so lazy. It's only a few stairs." She shook her head amusedly when Robbie said something mockingly under his breath and they proceeded into the house.</p>
<p>Robbie mounted the staircase and took me into Miley's room, placing me on her purple bed with a huff and then he delivered a comforting pat to my head before bending down to meet my eyes.</p>
<p>"I never had the chance to thank you for savin' my little girl. So, thank you and just know you're welcome in my home as long as you don't pee on the rugs," he said sombrely.</p>
<p>"Daddy!" Miley shrieked. I barked a laugh and this resulted in a very surprised look from Robbie.</p>
<p>"Darlin', did she just..."</p>
<p>"I think I hear the phone ringing!" Miley intervened as Robbie stared at me, not knowing whether his ears had deceived him or if I really did just laugh at what he said.</p>
<p>Miley pushed him until he was out of the room and she turned to me after closing the door.</p>
<p>"I can't believe he said that..."</p>
<p>My tail thumped in response to my escalating joy and Miley giggled, rushing over to wrap me in a light hug. I lifted my head and nodded at her bed, wanting her to sit down and act as my pillow. She understood my mute signal and lowered herself next to me and I collapsed onto her lap. Her fingers lingered on my neck as she sighed sadly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lilly. You've done so much for me. I wish I could make it up to you somehow." I whined, wanting to tell her she didn't have to make it up to me because I was happy to do whatever I could for her. She was my best friend and I'd throw myself between her and danger without a second thought.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Miley ~</p>
<p>"Lilly, are you hungry?" I called from the kitchen, hearing light thumps on the stairs as Lilly descended them and bounded to her bowl. I knew she wasn't very impressed with being treated like a house pet, but she seemed content. Content and healed. I had done everything in my power to help keep her wounds free of infection by bathing her daily, sifting through her fur to check the multiple cuts and applying ointment regularly. I wasn't sure if her skin would react negatively to human products in her wolf form, but trial and error proved that there was no harm.</p>
<p>And, admittedly, Lilly was beautiful throughout everything. She was not a savage beast, or a depressed and frightened puppy. She was just a girl. An incredibly caring and gentle girl cursed to be an animal half her life, but blessed with a soul and heart more human than any I had known. She was immaculate company. She sat quietly by my feet when I did my homework for school, she listened patiently when I talked to her, which really was just me thinking aloud, and she gave me a strong sense of security.</p>
<p>We'd spent our nights listening to the rain or music and at times, she'd pad up to my bookshelf and scan the novels I owned, nudging ones she was interested in. I would snicker each time at the sweet display and take the book from its nook, grinning as her tail wagged enthusiastically. Late night readings became a routine thing and I read aloud until Lilly fell asleep on my bed or on the floor. She was so uncorrupted, but I actually did want to hear her voice, her laugh. I wanted to see her human face smiling and flashing with all kinds of emotions. It was a peculiar thing, but I felt lonely going back to school.</p>
<p>I wanted Lilly sitting in class with me, staring blankly into space as she thought about everything going on in her life. She trusted me with her secret and I wanted to pass her in the hall and share a knowing smile because I was the one who knew what she was hiding. I wanted her to graduate with me and explore her options for the future goals she probably assumed she lost after being turned. There were so many things I was suddenly asking and Lilly could provide no response. And I had this strange need to lie down on my bed and listen to Lilly talk endlessly about her life, her past interests. Just, everything she could possibly remember, I wanted to know.</p>
<p>But I had to wait.</p>
