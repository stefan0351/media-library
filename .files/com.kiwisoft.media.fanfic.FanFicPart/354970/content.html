<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 30: Called Out -->

<p>Several miles from Cheyenne the group came upon a covered wagon
		all but blocking the road and preventing them from passing. A large blonde woman with deep
		green eyes sat patiently on the seat. A small scar faced man sat next to her, holding the
		reins. On the ground next to the wagon a cat lay curled up. She was white except for dark
		gray feet, face, and ears. Nervous looks were exchanged between the women as Josie pulled
		the wagon to a stop. "Stay here," she said firmly to Rebecca as she hopped out
		and walked over to the covered wagon.</p>

		<p>The young woman watched the gunslinger, noting the way Josie's
		hands never strayed far from her talking irons as she approached the strangers. Rebecca
		noted that even in the non-confrontational times, Josie felt the need to be on her guard.
		The blonde in the covered wagon climbed down, aided by the gunslinger's strong arms.</p>

		<p>"It's so good to see ya," she said as she wrapped her
		arms around the woman in black.</p>

		<p>"It's good to see you too, Sandy," Josie replied,
		taking a step back from the embrace. She looked up at the small man. "Earl," she
		said with a nod, receiving the same in response.</p>

		<p>"Your wire said that you needed help," Sandy said as
		she walked with Josie back to the caravan.</p>

		<p>"I don't; these women do," the gunslinger replied,
		waving with her arm to indicate the others. Sandy looked from one woman to the next,
		mentally assessing them. Elaine dismounted and walked over to her. The others took that as
		their cue to dismount. Many of them were rubbing their aching thighs and rears from the
		long ride. Rebecca climbed down and stood just behind Josie, close enough to hear the
		conversations without being in the way.</p>

		<p>After brief introductions, they settled down to business. "I
		have room for five women, but if necessary, I can probably find positions for the others
		at one of the other houses," Sandy said. Her eyes locked on the small blonde standing
		behind the gunslinger. "I don't know about this one, Josie. She looks a little too
		innocent. Reminds men of their daughters. A serving girl, perhaps."</p>

		<p>Rebecca's eyes flashed indignantly, but she held her tongue.
		Josie smirked at her friend before turning to face Sandy. "She's with me."</p>

		<p>"Didn't think you went for the young ones, Josie,"
		Sandy quipped, drawing a confused look from Rebecca and a warning glare from the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Can we get going?" Josie asked, but it was more of a
		statement.</p>

		<p>"Yes, of course." Sandy turned her attention to the
		prostitutes. "I don't want to be seen bringing all of you into town. You'll have to
		hide in the back of my wagon."</p>

		<p>One by one the women were put in the safety of the covered wagon.
		Only Josie, Rebecca, Stacey, and Elaine remained behind to deal with the horses and
		wagons. Sandy scooped up the purring feline and climbed back up into the seat on her
		wagon. The short man snapped the reins and set the horses into motion, turning in a wide
		arc to head back into town. Josie waited a few minutes before indicating that everyone
		should mount up.</p>

		<p>"What's going on?" Rebecca asked once they were settled
		back on the sheepskin covered seat. Josie slapped the reins on her flanks to get Flossy
		going before answering.</p>

		<p>"Sandy operates the largest whorehouse in Cheyenne. She'll
		take care of them, give them jobs."</p>

		<p>"But why hide them in the back of the wagon?"</p>

		<p>"Can you imagine what would happen if people see a half
		dozen whores suddenly show up in town? Sandy will slip them in through a back entrance. In
		time no one will realize that they weren't there before," although it seemed
		perfectly clear to her, Josie didn't seem to mind explaining everything to her young
		friend. "We'll enter separately and get a room at the boarding house."</p>

		<p>Seeing that Rebecca was satisfied with her explanation, Josie
		concentrated on guiding Flossy to the livery stable with Elaine following on her horse,
		leading one of the riderless mares. Stacey brought up the rear as usual, the remaining
		horses tethered to the back of her wagon. A heated discussion occurred at the livery
		between the gunslinger and the stable owner over the price. Rebecca was certain that Josie
		was at the point of handling the situation with her irons when she stepped in, smiling
		pleasantly.</p>

		<p>"Sir, you see these fine pieces of horseflesh?" she
		indicated the small string of horses. "What are they worth to you?" He rubbed
		the stubble on his chin as his mind worked feverishly to come up with a price.</p>

		<p>"Best I can do is one hundred dollars for the whole lot,
		including the wagons."</p>

		<p>"What!" Josie said loudly, pushing Rebecca gently out
		of the way so she could tower over the man.</p>

		<p>"Uh...er...I mean...."</p>

		<p>"You mean that two hundred for the horses alone is a fair
		price. That also includes stabling the others and storing the wagons." Her deep blue
		eyes dared him to argue.</p>

		<p>"Uh...yeah," he said, defeated.</p>

		<p>"I could have gotten a better price for the horses, you
		know," Rebecca said as they walked to the saloon. Stacey and Elaine walked behind
		them, exchanging amused glances as the young woman made the statement for the third time
		in as many minutes. As before, Josie chose to simply ignore the comment. Rebecca let out
		an exasperated huff and scowled. "If you would have just been patient."</p>

		<p>"I didn't feel like waiting an hour for the two of you to
		haggle," Josie replied matter-of-factly as they reached the saloon. The scowl was
		replaced with a look of hurt, reaching straight into the gunslinger's heart and filling
		her with guilt. She looked back at the others. "You two go on ahead. Sandy will be
		waiting for you. We'll be along."</p>

		<p>Stacey and Elaine nodded, understanding the two women's need to
		have a moment of privacy. Josie pulled Rebecca away from the swinging doors and out of
		sight of the other women. "Rebecca, I'm sorry I didn't want to wait. I have no doubt
		that you could have talked him up on the price. Next time I'll be more patient." She
		managed to get the words out without choking on them. Apologizing was something that the
		gunslinger just didn't do. But looking at the hurt in Rebecca's eyes and knowing that she
		was the cause was more than she could bear. She would have said anything to see a smile on
		that sweet young face. </p>

		<p>"Come on, you can make it up to me with dinner in that nice
		restaurant I saw as we entered town," Rebecca said, forcing a smile to her face to
		show the gunslinger she wasn't upset at her anymore. The comment Josie made about the next
		time made the young woman's heart fill with hope. It was the first time the bounty hunter
		had spoken to her as though they would be together in the future.</p>

		<p>"Deal," Josie said, showing a smile full of teeth.
		"I need a drink. Let's go."</p>

		<p>The saloon was typical of a large city. The long bar covered the
		left wall while the right wall contained a small stage and piano. Straight-ahead was the
		white staircase that led to the pleasures upstairs. Scattered about were several round
		tables, mostly empty as the men were still working in the mines or fields. A large
		chandelier hung auspiciously in the center of the room, the intricate design clearly out
		of place in the dusty tavern. The light from the multitude of candles reflected through
		the teardrop shaped pieces of lead glass, casting a soft glow on the room. Josie looked
		around and noted that the women were all upstairs. The parched feeling in her throat
		helped her make her decision. "We're going to have a drink first, then we'll go check
		on everyone," she said, knowing that Rebecca would want to see how Victoria was
		doing.</p>

		<p>"Okay," Rebecca agreed. Her mouth was as hot and dry as
		the gunslingers. They moseyed up to the bar and sat down on adjacent stools. As the
		bartender approached, Rebecca felt Josie press a dollar bill into her hand under the edge
		of the bar. The gunslinger kept her eyes on the bartender and acted as if nothing had
		happened.</p>

		<p>"Whiskey," Josie said firmly. "And an ale."</p>

		<p>"Sarsaparilla," Rebecca added. The gunslinger watched
		out of the corner of her eye as the young woman paid for the drinks with the bill she had
		been given. Although Josie's face showed no signs as to her thoughts, inside she was
		smiling at the look of pride on Rebecca's face.</p>

		<p>They were on their second round of drinks when a large boar of a
		man entered, flanked by two smaller but equally evil looking men. Josie watched them
		through the mirror behind the bar as they looked around the saloon. The bartender
		nonchalantly pulled on a rope that extended through the ceiling to a bell upstairs. The
		men took up residence two stools down from the bounty hunter. Within minutes, Sandy came
		down the stairs with Bobo bounding down after her. She fixed the largest of the newcomers
		with a glare and hissed at him.</p>

		<p>"Felix! I told you to stay out of here," she said as
		she approached the corner of the bar, making sure she was out of arm's reach.</p>

		<p>"Now Miss Sandy, you know what happened was an
		accident," he said as if it were true, sending the men with him into laughter.
		"I was just havin a bit 'o fun."</p>

		<p>"Your bit of fun cost me one of my best girls," she
		snarled. "Now you get out of here. None of the girls want anything to do with
		you."</p>

		<p>Felix moved off of his stool slowly, the look on his face
		menacing as he took a step closer to the madam. "She said for you to leave,"
		Josie said firmly, her attention seeming to never leave the glass in front of her. Felix
		stopped his advance and turned to look at the woman in black.</p>

		<p>"You got somethin' to say, woman?" he said, the last
		word spoken more as an insult. "Try usin' yer talking irons."</p>

		<p>"You calling me out?" she replied as she downed the
		last of her ale. Rebecca's eyes grew wide as she followed the route of the conversation.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." she hissed, pulling on the gunslinger's
		forearm to get her attention. "What are you doing?" Josie slid off the stool
		gracefully, her imposing frame towering over the smaller woman.</p>

		<p>"Go with Sandy...now," she said in a tone that brooked
		no arguments. Josie walked to the door, deliberately keeping her gaze away from the young
		woman's face. Sandy walked past the men and put her arm around Rebecca's shoulders.</p>

		<p>"Come on, child. This is no place for you right now,"
		she said as the men followed the gunslinger outside, joking and slapping Felix on the back
		in anticipation of his victory.</p>

		<p>"No!" Rebecca yelped, wrenching herself from the older
		woman's grasp. Sandy quickly recovered and wrapped both arms around the smaller woman's
		waist, pinning her arms. Jon, the bartender, frantically pulled on the rope, getting the
		attention of the women upstairs. Elaine was the first to arrive, skipping half the steps
		in her haste.</p>

		<p>"Child, please, Josie doesn't want you out there,"
		Sandy said, trying to get the squirming woman to understand. Elaine assessed the situation
		quickly and went to the doorway. In the middle of the street, Josie and Felix stood paces
		apart, paying no attention to the rapidly growing crowd of spectators. An enterprising man
		with a short black goatee was taking bets on the outcome, favoring the man with the
		bandoleers over the tall woman. Rebecca worked her way free by relaxing her leg muscles,
		sinking out of the madam's grasp. Elaine grabbed her at the doorway.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, don't you understand? Whatever happened, she can't
		back down now," Elaine said and then watched as a flicker of understanding appeared
		in the green eyes. She lowered her tone. "If you go out there, you'll only distract
		her. You don't want that, do you?"</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca said softly. It was obvious that the
		young woman was terrified for the gunslinger and very near the point of tears.</p>

		<p>"You don't need to watch this," the black headed woman
		offered. Rebecca sniffled and cleared her throat, straightening her back and raising her
		chin.</p>

		<p>"Yes I do," she said firmly. Elaine nodded and stepped
		to the side to make room for her to see out the doorway. Victoria came up behind them and
		put her hand on Rebecca's shoulder, squeezing softly.</p>

		<p>Josie's fingers twitched, flexing and relaxing in anticipation.
		She watched his movements carefully. He seemed relaxed and assured, as if no one could
		draw faster than him, let alone a woman. He reached for his gun, his fingers closing
		around the familiar piece of steel. He only got as far as pulling it out of his holster
		when his chest took the impact of Josie's bullet. It was over in the blink of an eye. The
		gunslinger stood there, smoking gun drawn, looking at the mortally wounded man slumping
		forward. His face registered his profound surprise as he pitched forward, dead before he
		hit the ground. For a moment no one moved except for the man with the goatee, who decided
		that sticking around wasn't such a good idea. Josie holstered her weapon as Felix's
		friends dragged his body off the street. The marshal waited for her at the doors to the
		saloon.</p>

		<p>"Nice shooting," he commented as she passed. Her face
		was an unreadable mask.</p>

		<p>"I did what I had to do. He called me out." She pushed
		her way through the doors and was quickly hugged by an emotional Rebecca. Josie stiffened
		and pulled back, giving the young woman a quick squeeze on her upper arms. In a tone that
		only Rebecca could hear, she said. "I'm okay, sprite."</p>

		<p>The barkeep set the bottle of whiskey and a fresh glass of ale on
		the counter in front of Josie. Sandy moved over and spoke quietly with the marshal.
		Rebecca felt the last of her reserves waning and raced out of the saloon, Victoria at her
		heels. Josie looked at the retreating form, debating about whether to follow her or not.</p>

		<p>"Let her go," Elaine said from just behind the
		gunslinger. Josie turned to look at her. "She was pretty upset. Hasn't she seen you
		kill before?", she asked as she led the bounty hunter back to the bar. Josie downed
		the shot of whiskey and drained half of her glass of ale before answering.</p>

		<p>"Not like that. She's never seen me called out before."
		Josie stared into the amber liquid, suddenly feeling very empty. Elaine recognized the
		look; she'd seen it on the faces of countless men over the years.</p>

		<p>"Josie...." she said softly, running a fingernail up
		the length of the powerful forearm. For a brief moment the thought of drowning herself in
		the throes of carnal pleasure appealed to the gunslinger, but only for a brief moment. She
		stood up.</p>

		<p>"I'd better go find Rebecca," she said, politely
		refusing the offer. Elaine gave a little smile of understanding.</p>

		<p>"I'll be here if you need me, Josie. You're
		welcome...anytime," the last word said in an unmistakable tone of invitation. The
		black headed woman turned and went up the stairs, giving a most flirtatious smile to the
		barkeep as she passed. It never hurt to get in good with the bartender. It always made for
		the best chance of getting the better clients.</p>

		<p>Rebecca sat on the ground with her back pressed up against the
		back of the building. The alleyway was empty except for her and Victoria. "Why did
		she do it?" she said between tears. "Doesn't she realize how easily she could
		have been killed?"</p>

		<p>"Dunno," Victoria replied. "Suppose she must. Bet
		she'd done it before."</p>

		<p>"Then why? Why take such a chance?" Rebecca said as she
		picked up a small stone and flung it as hard as she could against the building on the
		other side of the alleyway.</p>

		<p>"She's not like you, Rebecca. She a killer, that's fer sure.
		In her blood, ah think. She said he called her out. A killer can't not go then. Looks
		bad," Victoria said, hoping that her words would help, but noticed that the
		expression of anger and fear didn't leave her friend's face. "If she didn't, he'd
		have killed her right there in the saloon."</p>

		<p>"There has to be another way," Rebecca said adamantly.
		"She shouldn't keep putting herself in danger like that. She was out there, right in
		the open. If she wanted to, she could have talked her way out of it."</p>

		<p>"She ain't you, Rebecca. She talks with her guns, not her
		mouth. If you don't accept it, you'd best git away from her 'fore ya git
		yer heart broke."</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched as Victoria stood and headed back to the saloon.
		She remained there for a few minutes more, letting the waves of emotions run their course.
		Josie watched silently from the edge of the alleyway, not moving until she saw the young
		woman wipe the tears from her face and stand up. The gunslinger crossed the remaining
		distance between them. There was a long silence as blue eyes met green, Rebecca's
		unguarded face betraying all of her emotions. Finally she broke the silence.</p>

		<p>"I know why you did it, Josie, but I don't have to like
		it," she said firmly.</p>

		<p>"No, I suppose you don't," the gunslinger agreed.
		"But you also can't get in my way or we could both be killed."</p>

		<p>"Josie, am I your friend?" she asked softly, her eyes
		begging for a response. Josie took a step forward and put her hands on the young woman's
		shoulders.</p>

		<p>"Being my friend will only put you in danger, Rebecca, but
		yes...you are my friend," the gunslinger said firmly, admitting it to both of them.
		For a moment, she allowed herself to feel the tenderness of the moment, the feeling of
		knowing that she wasn't alone anymore, that they were no longer two people traveling
		together, but now something more, something much deeper. Friends. The word echoing through
		her head brought a rare smile to her face. "Come on, friend. Let's mosey over to the
		restaurant and get something for dinner."</p>

		<p>The mention of food paled in significance to 'friend', but
		Rebecca readily agreed to the offer of a warm meal, happy just to be with Josie. As they
		passed the theater, the young woman's eyes lit up at the sign announcing a performance
		later that evening. Then she saw the admission price of four bits per person and the smile
		left her face. The gunslinger noted and smiled to herself, knowing exactly where they
		would be going after dinner.</p>
