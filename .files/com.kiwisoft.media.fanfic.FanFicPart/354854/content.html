<!-- The Scientific Method \ Chapter 2 - Hypothesis -->

<p>While the crew was all too familiar with Seven of Nine's brutal honesty, what they did not realize was that she is just as honest with herself as she was with them. She considered lies, as well as self-delusion to be a corruption of data, which created false results and wasted efforts. That honesty was currently telling her she did not want to be standing at the door to Captain Janeway's ready room. While her emotions may be confusing at times, she was able to clearly feel her discomfort at the idea of talking to Captain Janeway.</p>

		<p>Discomfort was irrelevant, embarrassment was irrelevant. While she had thoroughly researched human, klingon, and female same sex mating habits it was proving not enough. While she could now be considered versed in the more technical aspects, the emotional details eluded her. She realized that she needed another's input to help her evaluate her data. Which is what had brought her to the captain's door. The captain's expressed desire to help Seven recover her lost humanity, combined with the captain's life experience seemed to make her an ideal candidate.</p>

		<p>The captain's response to the entrance chime brought Seven out of her reverie. As she entered the comfortably lit room Janeway seemed to read her expression right away as she looked up from her desk. "Seven, is something wrong?" Taking a steady breath the former drone started to reply. "I am unsure captain. I require your assistance in a ? personal matter." Janeway's features softened as she led Seven to sit at her couch and poured her a glass of tea. "I do not require liquid refreshment at this time." Janeway simply smiled as she said "Just in case. Now, how may I assist you?"</p>

		<p>"I need to discuss the ramifications of the alien experimentation." A look of profound concern overcame the captain's features as she spoke. "Is there something the Doctor had missed?" Realizing her words had misled the captain Seven quickly clarified. "No, the Doctor performed with his usual efficiency. It is the nature of the alien's experimentation that has caused the problem. Pervious emotions that I did not fully comprehend have been fully realized, but now that the treatment has been removed dealing with the emotions are causing new confusion."</p>

		<p>"I had read the Doctor's report, he had said that the alien's treatment was in the early stages, and if it were not for your Borg nature slowing the treatments course you would have lost your impulse control." Seven drew another steadying breath to continue. "It's is not the actual treatment, but the emotion's it allowed me to realize. The problem is I do not know how to act upon them." With a sudden look of dawning comprehension the captain briefly touched Seven's fully human hand. "So the treatment helped you to acknowledge your emotions, and you don't know what to do next?"</p>

		<p>"Precisely." Seven felt relief wash through her as she knew she had finally managed to state the nature of the problem. "So what is the nature of the emotions?" Just as quickly Seven felt the relief vanish and the discomfort return. " I have already researched my emotions as attraction, desire, and need. I need your assistance in verifying if they are returned." Seven of Nine's normally well developed awareness did not see the shocked expression that crossed the older woman's face to quickly vanish under a more schooled mask of concern.</p>

		<p>Captain Janeway's voice seemed both deeper and softer as she continued. "I suppose the first step would be to ask who we are talking about. Then to see if they have shown any signs of being interested in you." Seven did see the captain's now gently questioning expression as she waited to hear the name. "Lt. B'Elanna Torres is the person in question, and from my research Klingon affection of takes more aggressive forms." "So what you are saying is that you are attracted to B'Elanna, and want to know if she is attracted to you as well?"</p>

		<p>While relief was not an accurate description of the emotion she felt she was able to take comfort in simply saying. "Yes." Janeway seemed to take several moments to consider the young woman's words before she replied. "You had said that these emotions were realized after the alien's began their experimenting on you. Are you sure they did not influence your feelings like they did Tom and B'Elanna's?" Feeling a bit defensive, Seven tried not to let that color her tone as she replied. "I do not believe so, from what we have been able to recover the alien experimentation revolved around ways to lower my own emotional defenses. So emotional manipulation was not only not mentioned, but it would seem to interfere with their own expressed goal."</p>

		<p>She apparently did not keep her tone neutral as captain Janeway laid a comforting hand on her knee. "I was not questioning what you are feeling, I just wished to verify it." "Consider it verified. Physically, her Klingon musculature is complimented by my Borg enhancements. Mentally, her engineering skills excel my own. Emotionally, she has a much greater emotional awareness then I." "I see you have fully considered what attracts you to Lt. Torres, but have you fully considered why you think she is attracted to you?"</p>

		<p>"No, my lack of emotional awareness, combined with my own feelings have kept me from being able to collect any data." Janeway seemed to have her emotional equilibrium back as she smiled faintly. "So you are too distracted to look, even if you knew what to look for." Seven all but abandoned her attempts at emotional reserve as she continued. "Yes, the one thing I know is that she is essential to my continued function. My concern is that if she knew of my attraction she would no loner associate with me." Janeway was already shaking her head as she replied. "I think you don't give B'Elanna enough credit."</p>

		<p>"It was shortly before you joined the crew, but she had an admirer among her own engineering staff, and while she did not return his interest she never held it against him.  The same could be said for the current relations between her and Mr. Paris. From all I have seen she has not allowed it to damage their interaction." Seeing the young woman's expression darken Janeway continued in as gentle a town possible as she was able. "I can't guarantee anything to you. That is part of being in love, risking being in pain." Seven took several moments of quiet contemplation before she spoke."</p>

		<p>Then would it not be better to keep interaction on a less personal level and not incur the risk of rejection?" Janeway's eyes left Seven's for the briefest of moments. "You would think so wouldn't you? Then you will always wonder, and always curse yourself for not making the attempt." Her eyes locked on Seven's as she said. "You have to ask yourself one simple question. Is she worth it?" Seven's reply was instantaneous. "Yes." "Then go to her Seven, spend time with her, and when your heart tells you the time is right to tell her how you feel don't let anything tell you otherwise."</p>

		<p>Seven considered the captain's words, and nodded before standing. "Thank for your time captain, and for the tea." The blonde's long legs carried her to the ready room's door and out to the bridge. Unseen to her exiting back was the captain staring at the untouched glass of tea. "You are welcome? Annika."</p>

		<p>"Would you like to talk about it?" Harry's words caused B'Elanna to look up from the console she had just pounded her hand against. "Talk about what?" "About what has had you exposing me to parts of the Klingon language that aren't part of the curriculum at the academy. Is it Tom?" B'Elanna actually laughed at that; not a full voiced laugh, but a slight shaking of her shoulders. "I wish it was that easy Starfleet. Tom was easy, loving him was easy. He was like a big kid, or maybe a really bright pet. Sure he made the occasional mess you had to rub his nose in, but for the most part he gave unconditional love and just asked for love in return." While Harry grinned at her comparison he still looked concerned as he kept questioning her."</p>

		<p>You miss him don't you?" His expression went to slight shock, as she didn't bat an eye when she said. "No, not really. It was all a lie." "So what's the problem?" There were several moments of silence before B'Elanna spoke. "The problem is these emitters are still offline, and we need to be ready if the captain wants to fly us through any more pulsars." Keying more commands into her console Torres worked for several moments before she noticed that she was the only one. Looking up she could see her engineering staff busy at their stations, except for Ensign Harry Kim. He was looking at her with a solemn expression, clearly waiting for her to continue.</p>

		<p>Normally B'Elanna would have had no problem staring down the fresh-faced ensign, but she was exceptionally tired, and Harry seemed exceptionally determined. It didn't help that he was just worrying about her. "What?" "That's what I want to know." "Harry, I really don't have time for games right now." "It's not a game B'Elanna, I can see something is wrong." B'Elanna slammed a hand back down on her console, as she looked the ensign dead in the eye. "Harry, I appreciate your concern, but nothing is wrong. I am tired, with all of these repairs I have been pulling more shifts then is really good for me so, yes, I am a bit cranky."</p>

		<p>Harry did not look convinced, but he gently nudged the lieutenant out of the way as he said. "Then get some rest, I'll hold down the fort until you get some sleep. I'm sure the Doctor would tell you that you need to rest, or you will make mistakes." B'Elanna gave the ensign a dark look, but could see he didn't flinch, and would call in the EMH if she did not take his suggestion. "Fine! I'll be back in three hours." Harry was not trying to conceal his grin as he said. "Right, you'll be back in five hours." Growling B'Elanna said "I'll find you? in four hours."</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine suddenly understood the human expression; "My heart skipped a beat." because while her nanoprobes controlled her biological functions the moment that Lt. Torres opened her door she thought her nanites momentarily ceased function. First she had narrowly missed the lieutenant at engineering, but Ensign Kim had told her she had just left for her quarters after learning he could not help her. Now the lieutenant answered her admittance chime by coming to the door in person, in a black bathrobe that hung loosely around her shoulders exposing some of her strong shoulders and almond skin.</p>

		<p>Torres seemed just as shocked as she said. "Seven, what do you want?" Nervously Seven replied. "Nothing important, we can discuss it after you have rested." One of B'Elanna's hands briefly massaged the side of her neck, as she seemed to think. "No, it's ok. Harry just threw me out of my engine room, and I guess that has me a little jumpy. Come on in."</p>

		<p>While Seven was locked in trying to decide whether to look at the skin bared before her, or the eyes which seemed to pull her in and hold her there, the lieutenant's question broke through and caused her to follow the woman into her quarters. Though Seven didn't even try to restrain the impulse to admire the diminutive woman's lean build as her back was turned.</p>

		<p>As Torres faced her she said. "Have a seat." Seven's automatic response was out before she could contain it. "I prefer to stand." B'Elanna simply nodded while she leaned against a tabletop. "Alright, so what was it you needed?" Linking her arms behind her back she started to speak. "I thought I would inquire about your recovery from the alien's experimentation." The small smile B'Elanna formed warmed the drone in a way nothing else could. "I hope you didn't ask Harry how I was doing? but why me? I mean we were all experimented on."</p>

		<p>Seven paused, but quickly recovered. "The majority of the crew underwent physiological rather then psychological experimentation, but you and I were those most directly, and extensively psychologically modified. Ensign Kim had mentioned you seemed? distracted."</p>

		<p>As she spoke she could feel the klingon/human hybrid's eyes upon her. Scanning from head to toe, and Seven found she enjoyed it. She felt light-headed, with the nipples of her breasts becoming aching, and sensitive. As she felt a slight wetness between her legs she found she had to add a conscious effort to her nanoprobes effort to control her breathing.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna found herself biting down a moan as she stood up from the tabletop she was leaning against. She had been unable to keep herself from looking at Seven. Wrapped in her light blue biosuit she made the perfect image of the ice princess, and B'Elanna wanted to cool her now feverish skin. She felt her yes get hungrier as she thought to herself. "By Kehless, if she knew what it was that was distracting me!" Her breathing was getting deeper as she slowly started to circle the former drone, her voice in a low, almost purring tone. "I'm trying to sort things out right now." Seven was turning her head to track the lieutenant's progress. "I am attempting to sort out my feelings as well.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna found herself feeling dizzy as she spoke. "What feelings are you having Seven?" As she completed another circle around Seven their eyes met for what seemed an eternity. "B'Elanna?" "Yes Seven?" Seven swallowed. "Ensign Kim is expecting my assistance in engineering." B'Elanna had moved closer with each paced circle, and now she was close enough to feel Seven's breath stir her hair. All she had to do was lean in,stretch up, the slightest of motions and she would taste those soft, full lips.</p>

		<p>As the words managed to reach her brain her eyes closed, but she was still able to say. "Better not keep Harry waiting." The former Borg drone's body seemed like it did not want to comply as she turned to leave the room. "Sleep well B'Elanna." "Thank you Seven." As B'Elanna watched Seven walk to the doors and out of them she knew what she would be dreaming of. If she managed to get any sleep.</p>
