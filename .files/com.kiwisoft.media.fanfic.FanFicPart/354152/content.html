<!-- A Little Birdie Told Me So \ Part 3 -->

<p>Buffy sat on Giles' couch staring into the
fireplace. She could hear Spike rummaging around in kitchen no doubt doing
something that she didn't want to know about. Giles had left a few minutes
earlier to go grocery shopping meaning that she was alone with Spike until
the G-man got back or Willow arrived. Buffy turned her head to the side when
she heard Spike coming out of the kitchen. He was holding a mug in one hand
and some Wheat-a-bix in the other. Buffy frowned as he started to break the
wheat into the mug and made a face. There was only one word to describe what
she was feeling and that word was "ewwww!"</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"
Buffy asked even though she didn't rally want to know.</p>

<p>"Adds texture,"
Spike responded referring to the wheat. "High in fiber too, makes Spike a
strong boy."</p>

<p>"Just when I thought that you couldn't possibly get any more
disgusting," Buffy responded turning away as he lifted the mug to his
lips.</p>

<p>"Where's Oak?" Spike asked sitting down in the chair opposite
Buffy. Buffy glared at him.</p>

<p>"Willow," she said carefully annunciating
the word, "has a class and will be coming around later."</p>

<p>"Turn on the
Tele will you," Spike said turning away from her.</p>

<p>"Turn it on yourself,"
Buffy responded picking at one of her nails.</p>

<p>"I'm in the middle of my
bloody lunch right now woman," Spike responded. Buffy looked over at him
with a disgusted look on her face.</p>

<p>"You're dead, it's not like you've got
anything better to do," Buffy responded. "Turn on the damn 'Tele' yourself,"
she continued mocking his accent.</p>

<p>"You owe me," he said pointing an
accusatory finger in her face.</p>

<p>"I what?" Buffy asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>"I've still got Buffy taste in my mouth," he responded.
"Thinking about it gives me the willies."</p>

<p>"Drop dead," Buffy said
shooting him an utterly corrosive look.</p>

<p>"Been there, done that," Spike
responded.</p>

<p>"Do you want a return ticket?" Buffy asked
snidely.</p>

<p>"You must be an absolute joy to live with," Spike responded.
"You and Malibu Maple must have fun all day long."</p>

<p>"Shut up Spike,"
Buffy said staring at him. "You may be impotent and pathetic now, but if you
make one more tree joke I'm going to make you a dust buster happy
meal."</p>

<p>"Somebody's sensitive," Spike said backing off the Willow topic
for the moment. "Maybe you need more fiber in your diet," he suggested
holding his mug out to her.</p>

<p>"Ewww," Buffy responded turning away from
him.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a while after that. Buffy was looking at the
door hoping for someone, anyone, to get back, and Spike was slurping up his
blood making 'ohhh ahhh' sounds and rubbing his stomach.</p>

<p>After a
while the silence started to get to Buffy and she spoke up.</p>

<p>"You've gone
for almost three weeks without making any Angel jokes," she started. "Are
you feeling alright? Are you sick?" she asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"I can't eat, I
can't fight, and I can't even drink my bloody.blood, in peace. Yeah, I'm
fricking fantastic," Spike responded sarcastically. "Besides I get a better
reaction from the red-head jokes."</p>

<p>"Better reaction?" Buffy
asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Spike responded happily. "When I mention Fang-boy you just
get all bitchy, but when it comes Cedar your face turns all sorts of nifty
colours."</p>

<p>"My face is not hyper-colour," Buffy muttered under her breath.
"Like you should talk bleached boy," she continued slouching down into the
chair.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Spike said hearing the 'bleached boy' comment. "Like yours
is natural."</p>

<p>"Kiss my ass," Buffy shot back at him.</p>

<p>"Not even
if you pounced on me like a rabid dog.again," Spike responded making a face.
"Besides, would you rather Willow do it," he said tauntingly.</p>

<p>Buffy
looked over and glared at him. Did everybody know how she was
 feeling?</p>

<p>"Oh, did Spike hit a nerve," the vampire said smiling. "Did
I hurt the little Slayers feelings?" he asked. Buffy didn't respond. "Come
on," Spike said. "Did I? Did I hurt your feelings? Please tell me I did," he
 continued gleefully.</p>

<p>"Get out!" Buffy said standing up.</p>

<p>"It's
the middle of the afternoon," Spike said not moving. "It's sunny out
 there!"</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy said smiling. "Now get out!"</p>

<p>"You
can't do that," Spike said standing up and backing away from. "Giles won't
let you. You need me," he continued, although the last part sounded more
hopeful than anything else.</p>

<p>"Giles, isn't here," Buffy responded. "And
you don't have anything I need."</p>

<p>"Come on now," Spike said starting to
get a little worried. Buffy looked like she was enjoying herself. "Can't we
all just.get along?"</p>

<p>"Uh, let me think about that," Buffy responded
tilting her head up to the ceiling. "No."</p>

<p>"Geesh," Spike said. "And I
thought that love was suppose to make all you humans nice, and
friendly."</p>

<p>"I am not in love," Buffy said glaring at him.</p>

<p>"Keep
telling yourself that," Spike said sitting back down. He didn't feel that
his life was in immediate danger anymore.</p>

<p>"You can't just say 'keep
telling yourself that' and sit down," Buffy responded. "What the hell is
that suppose to mean? Who am I supposedly in love
with?"</p>

<p>"Willow."</p>

<p>"Willow?"</p>

<p>"Willow," Spike
confirmed.</p>

<p>"You.you are so, so, so.so, very, very.crazy, nuts, insane.and
if I do say so myself, not very nice," Buffy responded haltingly. She didn't
really know what the hell she was saying, just that what Spike had said had
felt true to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, why don't you just hump her leg and get it
over with already," Spike said making a face. "All that hand holding, and 'I
love you', no, 'I love you', blah, blah, blah, is making me sick. Just shag
already and shut up about it."</p>

<p>"I do not want to hump Willow's leg!"
Buffy said emphatically. She could not believe that she was having this
conversation with Spike. And the fact that he right just pissed her off to
no end.</p>

<p>"Do to," Spike responded.</p>

<p>"Do not," Buffy
said.</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Not."</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Not."</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Not."</p>

<p>And
so it continued, and continued, and continued, for a long, long
time.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow
practically ran over to Giles' house after her last class had finished.
Buffy had been acting odd all morning, not to mention the fact that she had
being acting beyond strange the night before. Buffy and strange kind of went
together, but she was acting strange even for her. Also, if she was going to
be completely honest she just wanted to see her friend. She was always
happiest when she and Buffy were around each other, when they were together
it was like the sky was bluer than normal, and the grass was greener than
normal, and everything was beautiful and beauty was everywhere.</p>

<p>As
she approached the door she could hear voices yelling inside. One of the
 voices was Buffy's, she was sure of that, and the other one sounded a lot
 like Spike. As she got closer to the door then voices got louder, but she
 still couldn't hear what they were saying. Fearing that someone was about
 to get staked, Willow quickly opened the door and went in. Spike seemed to
 be yelling "do" and Buffy was countering with "not".</p>

<p>"Do not what?"
Willow asked walking into the living room.</p>

<p>Buffy turned around at the
sound of Willows voice.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Buffy answered quickly.</p>

<p>"I
don't think so," Spike said still in his yelling voice. "She's bloody in
 lo." he stopped speaking when a piece of wood went flying by his
face.</p>

<p>"You tried to stake me!" he yelled pointing at Buffy. "She tried to
stake me!" he said again turning to look at Willow as if she was going to
back him up.</p>

<p>"If I tried to stake you, you'd be dust," Buffy
responded cockily.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" Willow asked watching the
interaction between the two of them in absolute bewilderment.</p>

<p>Buffy
continued to stare at Spike.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Buffy said holding the vampires
gaze.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Spike said sullenly a moment later. "Except that I hate
her," he said giving Buffy the evil eye.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked in mock
horror. "You.you don't like me? Oh my god, however shall I find the courage
go on?" she continued in the same tone.</p>

<p>"I'm going to watch Passions,"
Spike grumbled walking away. "Grace senses evil in Harmony," he continued
heading into one of the back rooms.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" Willow
asked walking over to Buffy.</p>

<p>"Spike and I.had a difference of opinion,"
Buffy responded hoping that Willow would leave it at that.</p>

<p>"About
what?" Willow asked following Buffy over to the couch to sit down.</p>

<p>"He
wanted me to turn on the TV and I didn't want to turn on the TV, so I told
him to turn on the damn TV himself, but he didn't like that suggestion, so I
told him to drop dead, and he said that he already had," Buffy paused to
take a breath then continued. "So I asked him if he wanted a return ticket,
and he said that I must be a joy to live with, and."</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Willow
asked stopping Buffy's story.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said turning to face her
friend.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that I asked," Willow responded.</p>

<p>"Hey, we all
make mistakes," Buffy said smiling.</p>

<p>"How's your head?" Willow asked.
Buffy had told her in the morning that it was fine, but she had still seemed
distracted in psychology class.</p>

<p>"In tact and working as well as it ever
it did.which maybe isn't saying much," Buffy responded. "How was class?" she
asked immediately afterwards wanting to avoid any conversation about
her.</p>

<p>Willow smiled and started telling her about what had happened during
her last class. Buffy leaned back, all was right with the
world.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy
was out patrolling and Willow had been in the library studying, but she was
finished with that and was bored so she decided to go patrol with Buffy.
Buffy was always around the sports stadium around this time so Willow
figured that she would be able to find her pretty easily. As long as she was
able to manage avoiding being killed, she was sitting pretty. As she headed
across the campus she found her thoughts drifting towards the very person
she was seeking out. Buffy. Actually, she found that her thoughts drifted to
Buffy quite a bit, in fact more than quite a bit. She was.she was smitten,
she had to admit it.</p>

<p>It had all started with that doppelganger of hers.
Bad, vamp, shanky, Willow who went around licking girls necks and trying to
'become one' with them. She had been blissfully unaware of the 'kind of gay'
in her until that incident. There was this unapologetic, charged, free
sexuality about her double, and even if you knew that she would snap your
neck as soon as kiss you, you were drawn to her. Being around her, being hit
on by her, and for a while even pretending to be her awakened something in
Willow, and she knew that it wasn't ever going to go to sleep again. She
knew now that she was no longer 'kind of', she just was. Being with Oz had
given her a kind of respite from thinking about it. So what if she watched
Law and Order because she thought that Carmichael was sexy? She had a
boyfriend that she genuinely cared about, who adored her, so it was a moot
point. But now, now she didn't have that boyfriend and the point wasn't so
moot anymore.</p>

<p>Willow was so lost in her thoughts that she didn't see the
girl walking opposite her on the path until the crashed into each
other.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Willow said putting her hands out in a gesture of peace.
"Are you alright?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm fine," the girl said her head was still
facing away from Willow but the hacker recognized her voice. Only one person
she knew had the smoky voice, it was Claire from her psyche class.</p>

<p>"I
wasn't paying attention," Willow said when Claire finally straightened
 up.</p>

<p>"That makes two of us," she responded. "I guess that we're
equally idiots," she continued with a smile.</p>

<p>"You're in Walsh's class
right?" Willow asked as they started walking in the same direction.
"Claire?"</p>

<p>"Two for two," Claire responded. "It's the voice right?" Willow
just kind of shrugged and nodded at the same time. Not an easy feat. "Your
name's Willow right?"</p>

<p>"Just like the tree," Willow told her with a
smile.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here so late?" Claire asked. "Usually it's
like the Isle of dead out here at night. No one's in sight."</p>

<p>"Yeah,
that's because people a habit of disappearing or dying of mysterious causes
around here," Willow said shaking her head.</p>

<p>"So?" Claire asked. "I
promise to submit to the Inquisition too."</p>

<p>"I'm just going to meet a
friend," Willow said looking down at the ground.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Claire asked.
If it wasn't so dark out Willow would have seen the knowing look on her
face, but it was dark out so she didn't.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow responded
smiling. "Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Just seen her in class. Like you," Claire
responded. "Where are you going? Maybe I'll walk you, safety in numbers you
know."</p>

<p>"It's probably out of your way," Willow responded. "We're meeting
down by the stadium."</p>

<p>"That's.odd," Claire responded. Willow
smiled.</p>

<p>"It's, well it's pretty deserted out there," she explained.
Vampires loved deserted and quiet. Buffy usually got some action out there
whenever she patrolled.</p>

<p>"Oh," Claire said smiling. "I get it," she
continued. She kind of shook her head after that, she thought that it was
absolutely deplorable that people who were so obviously in love with each
other had to sneak around and hide because small minded assholes ruled the
world.</p>

<p>"Yep," Willow responded doubting very much that Claire got it at
all.</p>

<p>"Well this is where I get off," Claire said stopping in front of one
of the dorms. "I just want you to know that I think it's great," Claire
added.</p>

<p>"What?" Willow asked confused.</p>

<p>"You and Buffy," Claire told
her. "It's so hard to find someone that you connect with in this world, and
when you find someone you should hold on to them, taboos and idiots be
damned."</p>

<p>"Wha." was all Willow managed to get out before Claire
continued.</p>

<p>"With all the homophobia out there most people are so afraid
to just be themselves. I think that you two are some of the bravest people
I've ever met," Claire continued before heading towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Bu.bu.but," Willow kind of squeaked out.</p>

<p>"Yeah, bye,"
Claire said. "I know you'll have a nice night," she added with a wink. After
that she disappeared behind the door leaving Willow there staring at the
building completely, utterly,
bewildered.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>From
her spot behind the tree Buffy saw Willow approaching her. Buffy knew that
Willow couldn't see her where she was standing, so she waited behind the
tree for Willow so that she could surprise her.</p>

<p>"What's a nice girl like
doing in a place like this?" Buffy asked coming out from behind the tree as
Willow walked by, and wrapping her arm around Willow's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Willow said distractedly.</p>

<p>"Don't sound so
enthusiastic Will," Buffy said. "I might actually think that you were happy
to see me," Buffy continued.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Willow responded. "I'm glad to see
you, that's why I came out here after all."</p>

<p>"Not because you were
bored and the phone lines are down?" Buffy asked knowing that Willow's
laptop was her other best friend.</p>

<p>"Nope, just because you're so
irresistible," Willow told her.</p>

<p>"You okay Will?" Buffy asked watching the
hacker closely. "You don't look so hot."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much,"
Willow said making face.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it that way," Buffy said drawing
Willow in a bit giving her a hug.</p>

<p>"I know," Willow said. It was just
that she couldn't get her mind off of what Claire had said before she left.
She hadn't come right out and said it, but it was clear that she was under
the impression that she and Buffy were lovers or something like that anyway.
She knew that the way she felt about Buffy was more than friendly, but she
didn't think that it was so obvious that strangers could pick up on it. She
was slightly uneasy with the idea. She didn't really care if people knew
about her, not now that she was out of High School anyway, but she wasn't
comfortable with people thinking that she and Buffy were a couple. Although
the idea gave her the fuzzies, it wasn't fair to Buffy to have people
thinking something about her that wasn't true. The trouble was that she
didn't know what to do about it.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Buffy asked, something
was definitely up with Willow.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Willow said. "I was just
thinking about a paper I have to write," she said deciding to keep what she
had learned earlier to herself for the moment.</p>

<p>"School, I tell you
it's a pox on all of us free spirits," Buffy said taking Willow's hand into
her own.</p>

<p>Willow squeezed back and smiled then they continued on
patrol.</p>
