<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 10-->

<p>Sam opened the door to Brooke's bedroom quietly, not that it really mattered
since the blonde had her headphones on and couldn't hear her anyway.  The
brunette leaned against the door frame and watched as her girlfriend swayed
those sexy hips to the beat of whatever song was being pumped into her ears.</p>

<p>"Loving you is not just luck or illusion/ It's in the make up of our DNA.
It's not by chance we make the perfect solution/ Don't fight it baby, you
know that it's just destiny's way/ Baby loving You/ Comes easily to me/
It's what I'm living for, it's all in the chemistry/ Baby loving you, is how
it's meant to be, it's something that is all so natural to me," Brooke sang
as she moved about her room oblivious to her observer.</p>

<p>A huge smile spread across Sam's face as she listened to words Brooke sang
out melodically.  S Club 7, a week ago she would have had a field day with
that, but then and there she simply found it utterly charming.  The blonde
actually had a beautiful singing voice, but bewilderingly-considering that
she was a cheerleader and a debater and an all around popular girl-she
seemed to have some sort of phobia singing in public.  Sam guessed that she
and Mr. McQueen were probably the only two people to have been blessed with
the gift of hearing her sing.  Still, that didn't mean Sam wasn't going to
exploit the situation if only just a little bit.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind her, Sam moved into the room carefully, trying not
to enter Brooke's line of vision as she snuck up, then once she was in
position she grabbed the dancing queen from behind.</p>

<p>Brooke yelped and yanked her headphones off spinning around to face Sam.</p>

<p>"Don't.  Do.  That," the cheerleader said, carefully annunciating every word
as she tried to slow her heart down.</p>

<p>"Come on," Sam said maneuvering behind Brooke once again, her hands
attaching themselves to the blonde's waist.  "Let's see some s-e-x in those
h-i-p's," she continued moving her own hips against Brooke.</p>

<p>"You know," Brooke said gamely moving along with Sam, "every year that you
shave off my life by scaring the shit out of me is a year that you're going
to have to live without me and my sunshine."</p>

<p>"You and your what?" Sam asked dangerously as her hands trailed up Brooke's
side.</p>

<p>"Me and my sunshine," Brooke responded even though she knew it was going to
get her in trouble.</p>

<p>"What was that again?" Sam asked as her hands inched their way under
Brooke's shirt.</p>

<p>"Sunshine," Brooke repeated, her body torn between excitement and
nervousness.</p>

<p>"Sunshine did you say?" Sam asked as she began to tickle Brooke's side.
"What's that I can't quite hear you?" the brunette continued smiling as the
blonde squirmed in her hands trying to escape her tyrannical grasp.</p>

<p>Brooke stumbled about the room trying to twist out of Sam's grasp as the
brunette continued to talk to her in a highly amused tone.  Finally reaching
the edge of her bed Brooke flung herself down onto it hoping to break Sam's
hold on her.  It worked, and once they were both lying on the bed Brooke
quickly pressed her advantage rolling over on top of Sam and sitting up so
that she was straddling her waist.</p>

<p>"Now who's the Queen of the castle?" Brooke asked smugly, her hands
playfully rambling up Sam's sides.</p>

<p>"You know what they say," Sam responded not even pretending like she wanted
to get out of Brooke's grasp.  "Behind every great ruler is an even greater
woman," she continued smiling.</p>

<p>"My better half," Brooke mumbled leaning down.</p>

<p>"Better looking definitely," Sam replied just before Brooke's lips reached
hers.</p>

<p>"Ohhh," Brooke responded turning her head to the side a mocking look of pain
covering her face.  "You're a mean one Mrs. Grinch," and with that she
smiled and leaned down once again drawing Sam into a kiss.</p>

<p>Sam felt Brooke's hand begin to make it's way under her shirt and quickly
reversed the situation so that she was now on top.  "Ah, ah, ah," Sam tisked
looking down at Brooke.  "You've got to begin to learn how to control
yourself.  I know I'm a sexy bitch, but you've got to learn restraint," Sam
continued a sexy smile spreading across her face.  "The parental units are
coming back today, which means no more naughty, naughty touching for
Brookie, Brookie."</p>

<p>"They're not home yet," Brooke responded as her hands resumed where they had
left off.  "Waste not, want not Sam.  We should make good use of what time
we have left."</p>

<p>Sam looked up at the face above hers, a soft smile coming across her face.
The mood had been light until that moment, that instant that Sam looked up
into Brooke's face.  But after that she felt a considerable change within
herself.  At that moment that she looked into Brooke's eyes she was overcome
with emotion, her mind running wild with thoughts of how when she kissed
Brooke she felt like all four winds were blowing against her face.  Of how
she felt like she was being picked up and carried away to a land of warmth,
and peace and love.  Of how she loved the way Brooke made her feel and she
loved the fact that everything Brooke inspired in her she too inspired in
Brooke.  And of how she loved the silky texture of Brooke's hair, and the
multitude of colours within her eyes expressing her every emotion if one
only looked, and the way the skin at the corner of her eyes crinkled when
she smiled.  She thought of how much she loved Brooke, and then she rose up
and brought their lips together.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Brooke asked, seeing the somewhat amazed look on Sam's face
previous to the other girl kissing her, as she ran a hand through her hair
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I..." Sam started then stopped suddenly finding herself at a loss for words.
She brought her hands to Brooke's face, softly tracing the contours of her
features, almost as if she were trying to burn them into her memory forever
more.  "I feel so much when I'm with you," she finally said softly.  "I want
to tell you...but there aren't any other words...except...I love you," she
finished quietly.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes fluttered shut momentarily after the last of Sam's words left
her mouth.  When her eyes finally opened they shimmered with unshed tears
and her mouth opened as if she were about to say something.  She wanted to
say something, something important, something revealing, something erudite,
and meaningful that would resound throughout the rest of their lives
together.  But all that she managed was "I..." before Sam leaned up and
brought their lips together once more, and suddenly whatever Brooke had
wanted to say didn't seem so important anymore, because she was able to show
Sam what needed to know.</p>
