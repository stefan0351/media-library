<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Fifteen -->

<p>Josua Maldonado was a cocaine addict.</p>
		<p>An accountant, miraculously successful, dependent on his drug to give him the energy he needed to pass the day without flipping out at the office. He was meticulously neat when it came to his work, careful not to show his dependence on the drug. No one could ever say he didn't do his job, didn't perform higher than their standards. His office stash of cocaine was maintained in his suitcase; a small pocket mirror, a small sharp razor blade, a half piece of a drinking straw, and the most important of all, the tiny bag with the white clumps of powder.</p>
		<p>He would lock himself into a stool in the restroom, pull out his supply, and proceed to chop at it with the blade on the mirror, until it was only powder, then he would separate the mound into lines and snort up about three, sometimes more.</p>
		<p>He was handsome, in a pretty boy sort of way. Along with delicate, yet strong, features, a large muscular body, and cute brown eyes, he had the perfect disarming smile. He dressed in all the latest fashions, and got his supply from the clothes salesman himself.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was his friend, knew him since high school, in fact. He'd been addicted almost since graduation, and she'd been trying to stop him, trying to convince him to get himself into a rehabilitation program. Of course, he good-naturedly spurned her advice, and never lost his temper with anyone, no matter how much people insulted his addiction. He'd just shrug them off and go and run a couple of lines for comfort.</p>
		<p>But along with trying to stop him, Cassidy often went to see him because he listened. As high as he may be, as busy as he was, he always had time for her; always maintained that she was the best friend he could have just for the fact that she worried about him.</p>
		<p>Today, she went to just sit and be companionable, to just sit in silence and listen to the music that they both liked so much. He opened the door at her ringing the doorbell, and exclaimed at her: "Girl, you look like shit!" He was hyper, his hands were shaking, and he obviously needed his treatment; he kept sniffing, and his thick upper lip twitched just slightly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy shrugged, she could always use brutal honesty, and whom better than from Josua Maldonado. She strode past him and flopped onto the couch, her hands deep into her light jean jacket's pockets. She wasn't dressed like her usual self, and that's what Josua noticed the second he saw her. She didn't look bad, not at all, but she seemed roughed. She wore black baggy sweats, a gray T-shirt, and white sneakers. She'd let her thick mane of hair hang loose and free, covering her face as she stared down at her lap. "Mind if I keep you company?" She asked quietly, not caring if he said no. She would stay anyway.</p>
		<p>But of course, Josua would never say no to Cassidy, his good buddy. "Of course I don't mind, honey." He said, and sat on the couch next to her. He reached under the couch, where he hid some of his stash and other equipment, and placed it on the coffee table.</p>
		<p>Cassidy watched almost blankly as he pulled open the little bag with the white chunky powder, poured it onto the mirror, proceeded to chop it into dust, and separated it into six lines. He reached down again, and pulled out a little box, placing it on the coffee table also, and opened it. He retrieved another piece of his endless supply of cut up straws. He ran two lines in quick succession, and sighed as he placed the down the mirror and closed his eyes. He inhaled deeply, feeling the rush go through him and settle into a mellow haze on his body.</p>
		<p>He smiled lazily, and turned to look at Cassidy. "Talk to me." He said softly, very slowly. Cassidy shook her head, and stared down at the floor. Josua reached for the mirror, and pushed it towards Cassidy. "Do it." He said slowly, his words running together and slurring. Cassidy turned her face away and shook her head no. "Come on," He insisted. "It relaxes me, and you look like you need some relaxation." Cassidy shook her head again. "Look, do it only this time." He said gently, in a motherly tone. "If you don't like, it never has to happen again. It'll help you talk to me, it'll allow you to open up." He pushed it further towards her, tempting her with his gently manipulating words.</p>
		<p>Cassidy stared down at the mirror held so close to her face, expressionless eyes studying the little mirror with its white snowy contents. She lifted her hand, took the mirror in her hands, and grabbed the little straw handed to her. She eyed him curiously, and he nodded encouragingly. "Come on, it wont hurt you, babe. Trust me." He said softly. Cassidy looked down at the powdery mirror again, and shrugged, lifting it towards her face and placing the straw inside her nostril and against a line.</p>
		<p>She inhaled slowly, and felt a flash of sudden energy move up from her nostril and into her body. She felt her eyes roll and shook her head quickly, blinking rapidly. Josua nudged her hand holding the mirror. "Do another one, come on." He said slowly. She did, and gasped at the feeling, tasting the drug on her tongue. It was like a dissolved aspirin, the taste on her tongue. She licked her lower lip, then her upper, standing up from the couch unsteadily. Josua took the hand mirror away from her, watching her walk around rubbing her nose. She stopped by the radio, and flipped the little switch, pumping up the volume.</p>
		<p>Hard rock, Josua's type of music, came on, and she moved her head into the rhythm. She dizzily eyed the mirror in Josua's hand, and moved towards him, taking it from his hand. He watched her pull another line, and then another, swaying at the feeling. He took the mirror from her hand and placed it on the coffee table. She moved away from him, pressing on a nostril, sucking in deeply. Through a haze, she walked through the apartment. It was true; the drug made her feel so much better, so much more energetic. So high. She felt as if she were flying amongst the clouds, and began to spin around the room with her arms outstretched.</p>
		<p>For now, she was in another world, in another dimension. A place where she wouldn't have to think about her problems, her depression. A feeling of dizzying bliss overtook her, and she gave herself to it.</p>
		<p>She woke up in her own apartment the next morning. She was on her bed, completely dressed, still holding her keys in her fist. A terrible headache greeted her, and she groaned, burying her face into the pillow, hiding from the blare of the sunlight coming in through the opened shades. Struggling up onto her hands and knees, she wondered idly how she could have possibly gotten home by herself. She could remember snorting so much cocaine, running around the apartment through a dizzy haze, and then nothing. Nothing at all.</p>
		<p>She sat down, and heard the occasional bleep from her answering machine; the beep that indicated that there were messages waiting. She stood up unsteadily, swaying slightly. Stumbling into the living room, she went towards her machine and pressed the button. It was a message from Ashleigh. She said: <i>Listen, you left and didn't even let me tell you that George and Gretchen asked me to let you know to meet us at Crystal Bar next Friday night, we'll be there at about ten. They're celebrating Gretchen's victory in the courts last week. You better be there, or I'll go find you at your place</i>.</p>
