<P>"Ok team lets go." B'Elanna motioned Seven and Ensign Parker onto the
transporter. Parker was in charge of the Hydroponics lab after Kes left them.
She had studied under Kes for some time and was more than happy to take over for
her mentor. </P>
<P>Normally the away team for M-Class planets would be larger than 3 people, but
they had recently engaged some alien vessels in combat and had many repairs to
do. That's why it took a lot of convincing on B'Elanna's part to lead this
mission. </P>
<P>"Beam away Ensign Fowler." B'Elanna was beaming as she would finally get a
little taste of home, even though there were some slight differences from Earth.
Before she knew it, B'Elanna was standing in an open field looking at some
rolling hills and a bright yellow sun over head. </P>
<P>"Alright team, time to get to work. Parker, see if you can find some edible
plants within a 1 km radius. Seven, monitor for any animal life signs that could
be a potential threat. I'll be over by those trees looking for something."
B'Elanna tried to start leaving for the trees she had pointed out when Seven's
curiosity got in the way, again. </P>
<P>"What exactly are you looking for Lt. Torres?" Seven queried. "Well, I want
to see if I can find some apples, okay." B'Elanna said impatiently. "Now, if you
don't mind, I'm gonna go search for some, and you can start to do your job."
B'Elanna started walking away when Seven spoke up again.</P>
<P>"Apples, a fruit originating from Earth. Many species find the fruit
repulsive, particularly Klingons. It is highly unlikely that you will find the
same fruit here on this planet in the Delta Quadrant. Therefore, making it an
inefficient use of time." Seven responded, feeling good at disobeying a direct
order from Torres once again.</P>
<P>"So I'm probably the only half-Klingon in the whole Universe that likes
apples, and it probably is a waste of time as you so eloquently put it. But I
just gave you an order and you're gonna follow it. So stop talking and start
doing." B'Elanna was getting flashbacks of her Engineering Holo-Program, and
they weren't very nice. </P>
<P>Seven decided not to pursue the argument as she felt she had won. For some
odd reason, Seven always felt good at making B'Elanna angry. She could not
explain this feeling, but it definitely made her wonder.</P>
<P>Several hours later, B'Elanna came stumbling out of the forest with her
Starfleet jacket in one hand, and some round purple fruit in the other. She
managed to walk over to where Ensign Parker and Seven were sitting without
dropping any of the fruit.</P>
<P>"Okay, granted, they aren't apples but they taste mighty good." She dropped
her jacket on a rock and took a big bite from one of the fruits. Trying to
convince Seven it wasn't a waste of time. Ensign Parker quickly added, "Nice
work Lt., but I found some greenish-red fruit that looks a little more like what
you're looking for." She handed B'Elanna what seemed pretty close to an apple.
B'Elanna, dropped the fruit she was holding and grabbed the alien apple from
Parker so fast, she thought she was bitten by a snake. Taking deep bites into
the fruit, she thought she was in heaven. "Oh, you are so gonna get a promotion
for this Parker, these are delicious." B'Elanna mumbled while chewing on the
alien apple. </P>
<P>"I fail to see how finding a certain type of fruit warrants a promotion."
Seven was puzzled. "Take it easy Seven, I was being sarcastic. I just meant that
I owe her a big favor and if she happens to be up for a promotion, I'll put in a
good word for her." Ensign Parker seemed to be beaming with the same enthusiasm
as B'Elanna at hearing those words. </P>
<P>Seven was going to respond but was cut off by B'Elanna. "Hey, how'd you know
I was looking for apples? I only told Seven about it." B'Elanna put out her hand
gesturing for another apple. "Well, when I came back to the transport site
heading in the other direction to search for more food, Seven seemed perturbed.
So I asked her what was wrong, and she said you were inefficiently using your
time here looking for apples. I just happened to come across some of them when I
searched the trees over there." She pointed to a patch of trees that B'Elanna
had decided was too far from the transport site to go looking. The patch was on
a high hill about 2 km away.</P>
<P>"Hey, didn’t I tell you to look for food within a 1 km radius?" B'Elanna
asked jokingly. "Well, I guess I accidentally dropped my tricorder and couldn’t
tell how far I was from the transport site." She answered trying to sound as
serious as possible and about to burst into laughter. "Well, I guess that
doesn't qualify as disobeying a direct order then." B'Elanna emphasized the word
guess. The two couldn't hold it in any longer and they burst out laughing. </P>
<P>Seven merely observed at the two interacting in this manner. It often
confused her as to why the crew found it humorous to engage in this type of
sarcastic talk. Only right now she felt something other than confusion. Seven
was feeling uncomfortable at how Lt. Torres and Ensign Parker were getting
along. Almost every encounter she had with the half-Klingon was an argument. The
only time she didn't argue with her was 24 hours ago in the mess hall. </P>
<P>B'Elanna and Parker were getting a little too close for comfort and Seven
stepped between the two and stated "I believe we are finished here and should
report back to the ship." B'Elanna backed off a little from the sudden
closeness. "Okay, but make sure you mark down the location of that apple patch,
I don't want to run out of apples before tonight."</P>
<P>Seven tapped her comm badge. "Seven to Voyager, 3 to beam up."</P>
<P>They waited silently for a reply but none came. "Odd, they should of
responded by now. Seven to Voyager, 3 to beam up." The three waited for another
20 breathless seconds. B'Elanna tapped her comm badge and asked if anyone on
Voyager could hear them, but to no avail. </P>
<P>"Great, I'm stuck down here with a Borg for company and my only apple supply
is 2 km away." She sat down on a rock. "Well, on the bright side the weather's
pretty good and I still have one apple left." She looked to where Ensign Parker
had put the apples, but there were no more. </P>
<P>She frantically looked around. "Hey, who took the last apple?" B'Elanna
turned to see Seven biting down on the last apple Ensign Parker had brought with
her. "You are correct Lt. Torres, apples are delicious." </P>
