<P>A.N. Ok faithful readers, this is the last chapter of this story. I hope you enjoy!</P><P><U>Closer When Dreaming â€“ Chapter Five</U></P><P><U>Lilly's POV</U></P><P>I felt my jaw drop and my eyes widen as I looked into Miley's curious gaze. I tried to speak to tell her I was sorry, that I just got carried away but I couldn't make my voice work. She was looking at me as if she knew what I was thinking and I knew I had to get out of there but before I had even moved, Miley had leaned forward, effectively pinning me to the bed since she was already half lying on top of me and kissed me. I had no defence against this and I melted against her, knowing that this is what I had wanted for the last three or so years of my life. Her hand that was underneath my vest top started gently stroking the skin of my stomach causing me to groan into the kiss. I felt the slight smirk on her lips through the kiss that we had yet to break and then I felt her lips part and her tongue softly run over my bottom lip and I gladly gave her entrance. The kiss that had started gentle soon turned passionate and my mind was racing. Miley was kissing me; she was kissing me like this! I never wanted to break away from her but the urge to breathe soon became undeniable and we parted but Miley only moved far enough away so she could look into my eyes.</P><P>"How long?" she whispered and I knew instantly that she was asking how long I had felt this way about her. I answered in a similar fashion.</P><P>"A while ... you?" I asked back. She smiled softly, placed a quick kiss on my lips before replying.</P><P>"Maybe a while longer ..."</P><P>We didn't need any further words as she leaned forward again and I met her half way for our next explosive kiss. I moved my hands to rest in the small of her back and had just slipped my fingertips under her waist band when my alarm started ringing. I groaned in annoyance and thought about ditching my lecture but Miley shook her head and smiled, clearly telling me I wasn't ditching. She gave me a short kiss and rolled off me to watch as I stood up and quickly changed. When I was ready I turned back to her, wanting to ask her if she'd be there when I got back. I knew she had a free day today as her lecturer had cancelled the lecture. She nodded at me before I even got the words out.</P><P>"I'll be waiting right here" she grinned. I grinned back and didn't stop for the rest of the day, with the thought of going back to Miley in our bed.</P><P><U>Miley's POV</U></P><P>If I had actually thought about it, Lilly's dropped jaw and widened eyes would have been something I usually would have laughed at, but laughing was far from how I felt right now as I could tell that she was panicking, majorly. I knew that when Lilly is panicked she runs so I had to do something before she did and the only thing I could think of was to kiss her. So I did. The feeling of Lilly melting against me as we kissed was absolute heaven; I couldn't believe this was happening. My hand was in its usual place, resting on her stomach and the skin underneath my fingers was warm and I couldn't help but start stroking the toned skin. Lilly groaned into this kiss as I did this and I smirked as I heard this. Lilly's reaction emboldened me so I ran my tongue over her bottom lip and was instantly given entrance. As the kiss turned passionate my mind was racing as I realised that I was finally kissing Lilly, after years of wanting and waiting, I was finally kissing her and the best bit? She was kissing me back.</P><P>Finally we both had to breathe so I pulled away gently but kept as close as I could whist we caught our breaths.</P><P>"How long?" I whispered, knowing she would understand I was asking how long she had felt the same way.</P><P>"A while, you?" she asked me. I smiled softly, placed a quick kiss on her lips before replying.</P><P>"Maybe a while longer ..."</P><P>I didn't need to hear anything else so I leaned forward and Lilly met me for another kiss. Damn I don't think I'll ever get tired of kissing her. She moves her hands to rest on the small of my back and was just starting to slip her fingertips into my waist band, something that I was mentally encouraging her to do when her alarm went off and we both groaned, her in annoyance and me in disappointment. I knew she had a lecture now and as she looked at me I could tell she was thinking of ditching so I gave her a look that I hoped was clearly saying, 'go your education is important'. I gave her a quick kiss and rolled of her so she could get up, which she did, resignedly.</P><P>She then got changed right in front of me and I could feel myself start to drool. Over the years we had seen each other's bodies in various states of undress and I don't even think she even realised what she was doing to me because she was dressed and ready to go in mere minutes with her usual efficiency. As she grabbed her bag at the door she turned to look at me, a question clear on her face. Would I be there when she got back? I didn't even think she needed to ask, like I would be anywhere else than waiting for her to come back to our bed. I nodded at her unasked question.</P><P>"I'll be waiting right here" I grinned. She grinned back and left for her lecture. I fell back against the pillow with a ridiculous smile on my lips.</P><P>Lilly would come back to our bed, I like the sound of that.</P><P>The End!</P><P>A.N. I think that some of you might not like where I've ended this but I think it would probably ruin the feel of the story if I continue it.
