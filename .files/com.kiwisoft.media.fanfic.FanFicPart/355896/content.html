<!-- Rites of Passage \ Epilogue -->

<p>The sun felt delicious on Joey's bare back; she was nearly asleep on the blanket when the shock of ice sliding down her neck made her shriek and jump up, with Kaela laughing over her head.</p>
		<p>"You evil, evil thing!" Joey chastised her, adjusting her bikini top as she rolled onto her back and sat up.</p>
		<p>"Oh, you know you loved it." Kaela's eyes were hidden behind her sunglasses, but Joey knew they were twinkling with merriment.</p>
		<p>"I admit to nothing," Joey said stubbornly, taking Kaela's sunglasses off as she sat down next to her.</p>
		<p>"Do you have the program, or did Dawson take it?"</p>
		<p>"It's right here," Dawson said as he came over to them balancing an armload of cold drinks. "If we ever come to this festival again, we're bringing a cooler. Do you have any idea how much these sodas cost?"</p>
		<p>"Our hero," Jen laughed, coming up behind him and kissing him on the cheek, while Joey got up to help unload the drinks.</p>
		<p>When the four of them were settled back onto their blanket, Joey began to pour over the program, eager to know who the first performer was.</p>
		<p>"So when's Ani?" Kaela asked eagerly, looking over Joey's shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Not for a while," Joey shook her head, leaning back into Kaela's frame languidly. Her skin was warm, the air was sticky; just a slight sea breeze came off the nearby water to refresh her senses. God, she felt good. Impulsively, she turned to kiss her impatient girlfriend on the lips. On another, less perfect day, Kaela might have turned away-- she was still a little insecure about public displays of affection-- but sitting there by the ocean on such a lovely August day, about to hear hours of fabulous music, she just felt too good to be nervous. So she kissed Joey back, not caring who saw her tongue, until they were rudely interrupted by yet another interloper.</p>
		<p>"Hey, the people didn't pay to see that," Pacey whined in a mock-complaining tone.</p>
		<p>"No," Joey said dryly, "they paid to see Ani DiFranco, the Indigo Girls, Tracy Chapman and Dar Williams all in one day. I think they can handle it."</p>
		<p>Pacey chuckled mirthfully, in full form for teasing. Joey couldn't stay mad at him much these days, though, and particularly not today-- after all, he was the one who'd gotten them all tickets to the Newport Folk Festival in the first place, and driven them there.</p>
		<p>"Hey," Kaela said suddenly, "I think I see Shana and Liv over there!" she pointed into the thick crowd further up on the lawn, and got up hurriedly to investigate. The copious new friends Joey and Kaela had made over the summer were also a direct result of Pacey's work; he had been the one to go to the school guidance counselor and find out about BAGLY, and then he'd actually shown the chivalry of offering his truck to them on loan for weekly outings to Boston Area Gay & Lesbian Youth. It had been a little weird at first, but a huge relief for both of them not to feel singled out for a few hours out of the week, and meeting hordes of other queer kids wasn't so bad, either. Those meetings had done a lot for both of them, as they seemed to for everyone who went. It was a safe place to sort things out, to know that everyone else understood what you were going through, to help you navigate the odyssey.</p>
		<p>Joey had encountered a little "bi-phobia" even there, though; it seemed that gay people could be just as ignorant as straight people in declaring that bisexuality was nothing more than a "fear of commitment," or that people who said they were bi were either straight people who were bored and wanted to be more risque, or gay people who wanted to feel more normal. Kaela had torn into those unfortunates so quickly and so convincingly, that the argument hadn't lasted long. Joey still felt the rebuff a little, and she'd never said anything in her own defense, but she knew she would when she felt more sure of herself. She knew Kaela didn't feel that way, anyhow, and that was all that mattered to her.</p>
		<p>After Kaela had been gone a few minutes, Pacey and Dawson roused themselves to wait in the discouragingly long line for the port-a-potty, and Joey and Jen were left to their wiles on the group's disheveled blanket.</p>
		<p>"...Good day, huh?" Jen asked lazily.</p>
		<p>"Great day," Joey agreed, sighing happily. "I can almost forget that school starts in two weeks."</p>
		<p>"*That* subject is taboo today, Joey," Jen said sternly through her haze of sun and humidity. "Let's talk about something else..."</p>
		<p>"Hmmm, how about sex gossip?"</p>
		<p>"What do you want to know, madam?"</p>
		<p>"Have you?" Joey asked slyly.</p>
		<p>"Not yet," Jen said frankly, raising herself up on her elbows as she cleared her head to undertake an actual discussion. "It's weird, we've been back together since June, but something's holding him back...he won't admit it, but I think he's still nervous since the last girl he had sex with went out and got herself a girlfriend the next day." Jen said this last part with a comedic grin, but Joey still hung her head.</p>
		<p>"I hope I didn't wound him for life," she winced, shaking her head.</p>
		<p>"Nonsense," Jen insisted, "you've just given him some classic, angsty material for his first blockbuster script, that's all. I can cure him of the rest," she grinned.</p>
		<p>"I certainly hope so," Joey smiled back. "I mean, he *is* my best friend. I want him to be happy. But right now, I can't conceive of anyone being as happy as I am."</p>
		<p>"That girl's got your number, huh?" Jen giggled wickedly.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah."</p>
		<p>When Joey didn't elaborate, Jen reminded her, "we were talking about sex, remember?"</p>
		<p>"I remember..." Joey blushed and felt herself glowing. "I'm just trying to think of what the words are for what she does to me."</p>
		<p>"Joey, as a friend, I have to tell you-- you are *so* gone."</p>
		<p>"I know," Joey nodded. "I don't think I'm even here."</p>
		<p>"Hey!" Kaela's energetic sing-song cut through the near-sleep that Jen and Joey had slipped into. Joey smiled before she opened her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Guess who I found?"</p>
		<p>"Andie, hi," Joey said warmly, gesturing for her to sit. "We were wondering whether you'd make it."</p>
		<p>"Thanks," the new addition smiled as she took her seat. "I told Pacey I'd meet you guys here, but I forgot that 'here' is a thousand people thick!"</p>
		<p>"Pacey's at the little boys' room right now, so just make yourself at home," Jen offered, tossing Andie a soda.</p>
		<p>They had all been glad when the new girl in town had found her way into Pacey's heart so quickly; he had always seemed to be the odd man out before. Pacey hadn't been sure Andie was going to make it to the festival, but she'd called last night from her father's house in Providence to say that she'd be able to meet them there, and then go back to Capeside with them, since her visit with her father had already gone on longer than planned. Kaela settled herself down with her head in Joey's lap, and Joey played with her hair absently while the four girls made idle small talk.</p>
		<p>When Pacey and Dawson returned from their bathroom venture no worse for wear, they were happily surprised to see Andie had joined the group-- particularly Pacey. He gave his girlfriend an enthusiastic kiss hello, and then hunkered down on the blanket. Dawson only squeezed Jen's hand and smiled his sheep dog smile, half afraid that any moment he would wake up from this idyllic dream. How could this perfection be real? The six of them, all lounging so contentedly in the summer sun, without a drop of angst to mar the serenity? Jen sitting next to him, looking like a goddess in her black bikini top and khaki cutoffs, was still too good to be true. And his two best friends flanked him, in total bliss, wrapped up in their own relationships.</p>
		<p>"Pinch me," he told Jen quickly. She did so obligingly, but not on his arm.</p>
		<p>"Ow, hey!" Dawson cried, grabbing her hand before she could further attack his defenseless ass.</p>
		<p>"Well, in the future I guess you should be more specific," she grinned at him, kissing him lightly on the lips. Dawson found her smile contagious.</p>
		<p>After a few more minutes had gone by, an MC got up on stage and informed the crowd that the program would begin shortly, which announcement was greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the multitudes. Joey looked down and wondered if Kaela was asleep, or just lounging with her eyes closed.</p>
		<p>"Sweetie, are you awake?" she asked gently near Kaela's ear.</p>
		<p>"Mmmm," Kaela replied, which Joey took to mean 'not really.'</p>
		<p>"Don't fall asleep now, honey, the music's about to start."</p>
		<p>Kaela opened one eye slowly, then the other. A sleepy smile spread over her face. Joey felt a rush in her stomach, and grazed her fingers over Kaela's cheek, brushing away a strand of hair. Kaela caught her hand and kissed it, and the rush Joey felt broke into a swarm of contented butterflies.</p>
		<p>"What you do to me," Joey murmured, and leaned in for a soft kiss, as the Indigo Girls walked on stage and began to play.</p>
