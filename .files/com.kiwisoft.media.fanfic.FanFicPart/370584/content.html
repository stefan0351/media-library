<p><i><b>A/N: So sorry about the ultimatum, I don't usually do those but I was sad to see such a lack of Liley updates and I knew other people were too, and I know I promised this chapter after only six updates but there have been many more than that since then-in fact, I think we reached the quota the very next day after chapter 10 was posted I would have posted this much sooner, but I had to leave for California for a few days-I was in a skateboarding competition and I didn't have access to the internet until I got back home. Tonight is my first night home, so here is the promised chapter. Sorry for the delay! Chapter 12 is in the works. Much love to those who updated their stories!<hr size=1 noshade></b></i></p>
<p>"Stewart," began Ruby uneasily at the breakfast table the next morning, "I'm making up the all-star soccer team to take over to Cedar Ridge tomorrow. You wouldn't want to join, would you?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Miley amiably. "Why not?"</p>
<p>Lilly choked on her milk.</p>
<p>Trina dropped her fork with a clatter.</p>
<p>Ruby's eyebrows shot all the way up to her hairline. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"If Lilly can come," stipulated Miley.</p>
<p>"Oh—yeah. Yeah, sure," stammered Ruby. "Lilly who?"</p>
<p>"Former head counselor Truscott," said Miley.</p>
<p>"Sure. No problem." Ruby didn't particularly want Lilly on the team, but Stewart would make up for it. The way she played soccer, Stewart would make up for everybody.</p>
<p>"I thought you didn't play soccer," sneered Ashley.</p>
<p>"Shut up!" snapped Lilly. "Hey, Miley," she whispered, "I thought you didn't play soccer."</p>
<p>"I don't," whispered Miley in reply.</p>
<p>"So why did you volunteer to play?" asked Lilly, bewildered.</p>
<p>Miley's eyes gleamed. "I'll explain it later."</p>
<p>"Kitty, you unfortunate sap!" gloated Ruby, watching the baseball game between the Algonkian all-stars and the visiting team from Spruce Valley. "If you were a better chess player, you'd be winning this game."</p>
<p>"Your turn will come," muttered Kitty darkly, throwing her hat in the dirt and stomping on it as Spruce Valley scored yet another run. "Tomorrow, in fact, when Cedar Ridge pulverizes you."</p>
<p>"Don't be too sure," said Ruby. "We've got a pretty good team this year and" –she paused for effect— "Stewart's playing."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i> How did you do that? What did you promise her?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," said Ruby airily. "I just asked her to play and she said sure."</p>
<p>"But she didn't want to play baseball," protested Kitty in agony. "Why didn't she want to play on <i>my</i> team?"</p>
<p>"Who knows?" said Ruby. "And who cares? I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. She's going to play, and we're going to win."</p>
<p>The crack of a bat signified another hit for Spruce Valley.</p>
<p>"Congratulations," moaned Kitty, holding her head.</p>
<p>"Well?" demanded Lilly as she and Miley settled down in arts and crafts to work on their tie racks. She looked around to make sure that Chantel was out of earshot. "What's the big idea? Why did you agree to play for the soccer team? And why on earth did you volunteer <i>me?</i> I <i>hate</i> soccer!"</p>
<p>"Think," said Miley with great relish. "Tomorrow, as members of the Alcatraz all-star soccer team, we are going to Cedar Ridge. Cedar Ridge is on the mainland. Presto. Opportunity knocks."</p>
<p>"We're going to escape in the middle of a soccer game?" asked Lilly incredulously.</p>
<p>"Shhh. Yes," said Miley. "On the way there, we'll pick out a meeting place. Then, during the game, we'll find some way to take off."</p>
<p>"What's the meeting place for?" asked Lilly anxiously.</p>
<p>"In case we get separated," Miley explained. "It'll probably work best if only one of us takes off first. Then, while the clones are looking for one of us, the other runs off in the confusion. Then we meet and go home. Simple?"</p>
<p>Lilly laughed nervously. "And if we're caught?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "They'll haul us back the way they always do, and we'll lug a little more garbage."</p>
<p>Chantel strolled over to them. "Hi. How are the tie racks coming?"</p>
<p>Miley held up her untouched pieces of wood. "How do you like it so far?"</p>
<p>Chantel laughed. "You know, I expect better than that from the former camp director" –her glance took in Lilly— "and her chief exec."</p>
<p>Miley raised her eyebrows. "<i>I</i> expect more patience and understanding from a girl who won so many ribbons yesterday."</p>
<p>Chantel reached into her pocket. "Seven, to be exact. Say, Stewart, I just heard that you're going to play for the soccer team. Is it true?"</p>
<p>"I have no privacy," Miley complained.</p>
<p>"Then you're playing?" repeated Chantel.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That's just great. I'm glad to hear it. Okay, don't let me disturb you. Keep working on the old tie racks. And tomorrow you show Cedar Ridge what it's all about."</p>
<p>"Oh, we intend to," said Miley earnestly.</p>
<p>The beaver was having a good day. He had not been disturbed at all. The dam was nearing completion, rising strong and firm above the water level. Soon he would finish and the stream would widen into the pond he needed. He stopped in his labors and sniffed the air. It was still a good few days before the rain would come. And when it did come, he would be ready.</p>
<p>"Congratulations to <i>us!</i>" exclaimed Marina, waving her arms in victory among the rest of the counselors at that night's meeting. "We have <i>done it!</i> We have made a camper out of Miley Stewart!"</p>
<p>"We have indeed," agreed Ruby jubilantly. "The impossible has been done. If we could only explain it to Ms. Warden, I'm pretty sure an accomplishment like this would qualify us for a raise!"</p>
<p>"I should get the raise," put in Trina. "I took all the lumps."</p>
<p>"No, I should get the raise," muttered Kitty. "It was my baseball team that was sacrificed. Why couldn't you have made a camper out of her a day earlier?"</p>
<p>"We couldn't have done it without you, Kitty-girl," laughed Marina. "It was your great talent as a chess player that brought it all about."</p>
<p>"Less than twenty moves," mourned Kitty. "That kid plays chess like Bobby Fischer!"</p>
<p>"And soccer like Pele," crowed Ruby, anticipating tomorrow.</p>
<p>"And she runs like Henry Rono," added Trina, breaking into a broad grin. "We've got the intercamp track meet coming up next week."</p>
<p>"I wish we had some champagne," said Marina wistfully. "We could toast Algonkian, the new California champions—at everything!"</p>
<p>"Except baseball," added Kitty sourly. "We were eliminated today, as you might have guessed."</p>
<p>"I'm wondering," said Chantel thoughtfully, "what would make a kid like Stewart have such a change of heart."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's easy," said Marina. "Yesterday did it. Stewart had a ball, and so did all the other girls. And so did we, for that matter."</p>
<p>"Hey, Marina," said Lucy, "did Ms. Warden give you any flak about yesterday?"</p>
<p>"No," laughed Marina. "A couple of times she looked as if she wanted to ask a question or two, but then she thought better of it. I don't think she wants to know, and I sure don't want to tell her. She wouldn't understand anyway."</p>
<p>"I want to go to the soccer match tomorrow," said Trina, "and watch Stewart crush Cedar Ridge. Chantel, how about looking after my cabin for the day?"</p>
<p>"Well, I thought I'd go to the soccer game—" began Chantel.</p>
<p>"No fair!" yelled Lauren. "I never get off the island! This time it's my turn!"</p>
<p>"No chance!" snapped Kitty. "My baseball team was sacrificed! The least you can do is let me go along on the trip to Cedar Ridge!"</p>
<p>The meeting became a babble of protest.</p>
<p>"I know," announced Trina. "We'll get Stewart to pick a number at random—uh, say, thirteen."</p>
<p>"We'll draw lots," decided Marina. "That's the only square way."</p>
<p>Early the next afternoon the Camp Algonkian bus pulled up in front of a huge sign that read <i>Welcome to Camp Cedar Ridge, the Funshine Place.</i></p>
<p>All camps looked alike to Lilly Truscott, and Cedar Ridge was no exception. There were the usual cabins, buildings and athletic facilities just like those at Algonkian. There was the 'you <i>must</i> have fun' atmosphere, although in this place it was probably 'funshine.' Even the counselors looked and dressed the same.</p>
<p>"All cloned from the same master cell," commented Miley to Lilly. "I can hardly wait to see the camp director's legs."</p>
<p>The girls had been traveling for over an hour. They had left Algonkian Island by launch at one o'clock. A bus had been waiting for them at the mainland receiving dock, and they had been driven about twenty miles, according to Miley's calculations, in a south-easterly direction.</p>
<p>"Look," whispered Miley as the team rattled off the bus, "do you see that big road sign down there around that bend? The woods are right up to the highway at that point. We'll meet just inside the woods by that sign. Got it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but how do we get there?" squeaked Lilly.</p>
<p>"I'll figure that out when I see the soccer field," said Miley.</p>
<p>"All right!" chirped Ruby, "who's going to win?"</p>
<p>"We are!" cheered the Algonkian girls.</p>
<p>Trina, who had picked the longest straw at yesterday's counselors' meeting and was convinced that her bad luck was changing, placed a hand on Miley's slender shoulder. "I'm expecting great things from you out there, Stewart. I'm really glad you got smart and joined the team."</p>
<p>"I'm glad too," said Miley, poker-faced.</p>
<p>A Cedar Ridge counselor, the image of Marina, jogged up to greet them. "Hi there, Ruby. Back for more?"</p>
<p>"We'll see," said Ruby smugly.</p>
<p>"Come on, you guys! Let's move!" bellowed Trina, and the team trotted off towards the soccer field where the Cedar Ridge all-stars were already warming up.</p>
<p>"Perfect," approved Miley to Lilly, who was jogging along beside her. "The soccer field goes right up to the trees. Here's the plan. We'll play for a little while to get the clones really excited. Then, when the time is right, I'm going to kick the ball into the woods. You go after it and keep on going. While they're looking for you, I'll slip away and we'll meet at the sign."</p>
<p>"But—" Lilly began.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "If you don't want to go, I'll look for that ball myself."</p>
<p>"I'll go," gulped Lilly.</p>
<p>"It's five to nothing! Five to nothing!" howled Trina as Miley maneuvered her way up the field and kicked another goal.</p>
<p>Ruby uttered a hoarse cry of joy and cast a triumphant look towards the Cedar Ridge counselors, who were huddled on the sidelines trying to hide their dismay. Algonkian had always been an easy mark at soccer—and at everything else, for that matter. What was going on here? Who was this kid who had scored all their goals and handled a soccer ball as if it was glued to her feet?</p>
<p>On the field, Miley stole the ball and began snaking her way through the Cedar Ridge players, relentlessly moving towards their goal. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Lilly standing near the out-of-bounds line at the corner of the goal. Lilly would never be in a better position than she was now. Miley drew her leg back and kicked. The ball whizzed by the goal and sailed into the woods just beyond where Lilly was positioned.</p>
<p>"I'll get it!" called Lilly as she disappeared after the ball.</p>
<p>"She missed!" Trina exclaimed, astounded. "Stewart <i>missed!</i>"</p>
<p>"It's about time, too," growled the Cedar Ridge coach.</p>
<p>"But Stewart doesn't miss. Ever." Trina turned to Ruby. "Why would she miss?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't she?" said Ruby impatiently. "She's human."</p>
<p>"Not Stewart," Trina insisted. "She hits what she aims for."</p>
<p>"That's silly," said Ruby. "You've hardly seen her play at all."</p>
<p>"I've seen enough," said Trina. "Enough to know she doesn't miss. <i>Why</i> did she miss?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Ruby, beginning to pace. "Where's Truscott with that ball?"</p>
<p>"Truscott," repeated Trina. "Truscott…<i>Stewart!</i>"</p>
<p>Miley was successfully mingling with the spectators on the sidelines, and edging herself ever closer to the trees.</p>
<p>"Hold that kid!" bellowed Trina, starting to run towards Miley. "It's a trick!" she yelled over her shoulder at Ruby. "A trick! You find Truscott! I'll get Stewart!"</p>
<p>Ruby tore off into the woods where the ball and then Lilly had disappeared.</p>
<p>Miley tried to make for the woods, but the crowd of decidedly hostile Cedar Ridge campers crowded tightly around and kept her from making any progress. Finally she assumed a resigned look and raised her arms in surrender.</p>
<p>"Comrade," she said mildly as Trina came puffing up.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Stewart! And get those hands down! Now, where's Truscott?"</p>
<p>"Who?" asked Miley innocently.</p>
<p>"Your accomplice! Truscott!" yelled Trina.</p>
<p>"Sorry. Never heard of her," replied Miley politely.</p>
<p>"Come on, Stewart!" ordered Trina. "Tell me where to find Truscott!"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid all I can give you is my name, rank and serial number," intoned Miley.</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart!</i>" roared Trina.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you may torture me," said Miley dramatically, noting that she had an astounded audience of Cedar Ridge campers and counselors. "You may beat me. You may stick flaming bamboo under my fingernails. But I still won't give you any information."</p>
<p>"What's going on?" asked one of the Cedar Ridge counselors. "What are you guys running over at Algonkian—a prison camp?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Miley pointedly.</p>
<p>Trina looked around, but Ruby had still not returned. "Stewart, if you don't start talking, I'll break your neck!"</p>
<p>"Dead, I am of no use to you," said Miley calmly.</p>
<p>All at once the crowd was on Miley's side.</p>
<p>"She's got a point there," laughed one of the counselors.</p>
<p>"Leave her alone!"</p>
<p>"Pick on someone your own size!"</p>
<p>"Stewart," begged Trina, "where's Truscott? If she gets lost, something could happen to her!"</p>
<p>"You may hang me by my thumbs," replied Miley, "or stretch me on the rack. You may stick my head in a blender, but I'll never tell."</p>
<p>By now, Cedar Ridge was hysterical with laughter.</p>
<p>Ruby came loping out of the woods with the soccer ball but no Lilly. "Where's Truscott?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean where's Truscott?" cried Trina. "I sent <i>you</i> after Truscott!"</p>
<p>"At least I got the ball," said Ruby. "As for Truscott's whereabouts, let's squeeze it out of Stewart."</p>
<p>"You may hold my head under water," Miley continued, "or feed me to the alligators, but never will I break down."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't go to that Algonkian place!" said a very small camper fervently. "They torture you there!"</p>
<p>"And they've got alligators!"</p>
<p>"Hey," said one of the older girls to Miley, "is it always like this at Algonkian?"</p>
<p>"No," said Miley, poker-faced. "Sometimes it gets exciting."</p>
<p>"Where is she, where is she, <i>where is she?</i>" Trina was shouting. "Where's Truscott?"</p>
<p>"Here," said a sheepish voice. The crowd parted and Lilly, red-faced, walked up to face her counselors.</p>
<p>"<i>Where were you?</i>" bellowed Trina.</p>
<p>"You only have to give your name, rank and serial number," Miley reminded her.</p>
<p>"I couldn't find the ball?" suggested Lilly hopefully.</p>
<p>"Can it!" snapped Trina. "I know where you were!"</p>
<p>"Then why did you ask?" said Miley.</p>
<p>"Five more days work detail for the two of you!" yelled Trina.</p>
<p>"Hey, guys," put in Ruby, "could we finish the game?"</p>
<p>"All right," said Trina sternly, "we're going to finish the game! Stewart, Truscott, no tricks, right?"</p>
<p>"Right," conceded Miley and Lilly.</p>
<p>Both teams took the field again.</p>
<p>Marina was waiting as the launch slipped into its place at the Algonkian Island dock.</p>
<p>"Well?" she asked Trina, who was the first one off. "How did we do?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask!" muttered Trina furiously, storming on by.</p>
<p>Marina turned to Ruby. "You mean we lost?"</p>
<p>"No, we killed them," Ruby replied. "Eleven to two. Stewart scored ten goals."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Marina, bewildered. "Then, what in the world…"</p>
<p>"…is eating you, Trina?" asked Marina at that evening's counselors' meeting. "We won, didn't we? Our girl Stewart clobbered them."</p>
<p>"Yes, and she also tried to run away again," stormed Trina. "Truscott would have made it, too, if she hadn't got lost taking two steps without Stewart. Stewart hasn't reformed. She's worse than ever. She only agreed to play on the soccer team because it would get her to the mainland."</p>
<p>"But then why did she score all those goals?" asked Kitty, mystified. "Why did she bother to play so well if she only went there so she could run away?"</p>
<p>"As I see it," said Chantel, "that's Stewart's character. She's honest, and she won't purposely play below her ability. I suppose the kid just doesn't like camp. It's not for everybody, you know. Maybe we should have told Ms. Warden a long time ago. But it's too late now. How do we let her know all this has been going on and we haven't told her?"</p>
<p>"I <i>tried</i> to tell her," Trina insisted, "the first time we caught Stewart and Truscott lighting out on a boat. She didn't understand."</p>
<p>"She doesn't understand anything," said Marina. "We're just going to have to see this through."</p>
<p>"And we've got to keep tighter security on Stewart," added Trina. "She can't be given an opportunity to go anywhere near the mainland. And she'll have to be under twenty-four hour surveillance, even on the island." She gestured helplessly. "Who knows what she could be doing right now?"</p>
<p>"What about the dance tomorrow at Silver Lake?" asked Lucy. "Everybody's going."</p>
<p>"No way!" snapped Trina. "I absolutely forbid it! Stewart and Truscott aren't going. Much as <i>I</i> want to go, I'll stay here with them."</p>
<p>"You can't do that," exclaimed Marina. "Everybody is supposed to go—all the campers and all of us."</p>
<p>"Not Stewart and Truscott! And not me, if that's what it takes to keep them here."</p>
<p>"All right," said Marina, "<i>you</i> explain it to Ms. Warden."</p>
<p>Trina swallowed hard. Then, "Well, if we really watch them, I suppose they can go."</p>
<p>There was a long silence. A strange look came over Trina's face, almost like a goofy grin, and she said, to no one in particular, "I like it better this way. I do. I could never get used to the idea of a nice peaceful Stewart." She sighed. "This way at least I know where I stand."</p>
<p>All the girls were in bed, and Cabin 13 was dark. From the lower bunk in the far corner a foot rose and delivered a sharp kick to the mattress above it.</p>
<p>"Hey," whispered Lilly, "what did you do that for?"</p>
<p>"That," said Miley, "was for coming back when you were home free."</p>
<p>"I wasn't home free. I was lost," Lilly defended herself.</p>
<p>"No one could get lost with such simple instructions," said Miley. "Did you get to our meeting place?"</p>
<p>"Well—yeah."</p>
<p>"Then why did you come back?"</p>
<p>"Because you didn't come," said Lilly. "So I went back to see what had happened, and I saw you were caught. So I gave myself up."</p>
<p>"Two stupids don't make a smart. You were free and you blew it. Now you'll have to spend another day here—maybe two."</p>
<p>"Then we're going again?" asked Lilly in a small voice.</p>
<p>"Naturally," said Miley. "Now get some sleep."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Miley."</p>
<p>"Don't apologize to me." Miley yawned. "Apologize to yourself."</p>
