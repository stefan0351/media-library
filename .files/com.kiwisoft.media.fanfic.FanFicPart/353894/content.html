<!-- Bound \ Chapter 5 - The Fury -->

<P>It had taken nearly two hours to repair the damage in the Jeffries Tube and B'Elanna was deadly tired. She needed a shower, food and bed and she was seriously considering skipping the first two and going straight to bed. She was really pissed off about missing her evening with Seven and was toying with idea of paying a quick visit to Cargobay Two. If Seven was regenerating, then she could leave her a poem or a dirty limerick or something. The thought of seeing Seven, even if only for a few minutes washed away the tiredness and she quickly started to make her way the cargobay. Halfway there, she bumped into Tom and Harry coming out the holodeck. They were dressed in 20<SUP>th</SUP> century gangster suits, they clearly been having a good time.</P>
<P>"Hey, B'Elanna, my sweet, my favourite ex-wife, how are you?" Tom called out a little too loudly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna leaned against the wall and folded her arms, "Tom, you idiot, you're drunk." </P>
<P>She looked over at a sheepish looking Harry Kim, " You let him drink, Harry?"</P>
<P>Harry grinned and shrugged his shoulders, "We're on our way to sickbay now and he's not on duty for another 6 hours. Everything's under control."</P>
<P>Just as he said that Tom stumbled and nearly fell, B'Elanna caught him just in time and tried to prop him up against the wall.</P>
<P>Tom had other ideas and draped his arms around her shoulders and planted a huge sloppy kiss on the surprised mouth of his ex-wife.</P>
<P>"You know, Lanna, we don't dance anymore, whyish that?" he slurred. </P>
<P>B'Elanna giggled. " Tom you are an absolute dolt, we never danced. Now get off me, you big lug."</P>
<P>In the ensuing struggle to get Tom fully upright and walking in the right direction, none of the three noticed Seven observing the scene. She had arrived when Tom had his arms around B'Elanna and watched in fury as he kissed her. She turned on her heel and stormed away, not fully understanding what she had just seen other than that B'Elanna had been in the arms of her ex-lover. </P>
<P>By the time she and Harry had got Tom to the Doctor, B'Elanna could barely see straight she was that tired. She went to bed promising herself that she would see Seven the following day even if it killed her.</P>
<P>The next day just after her shift ended B'Elanna was reading some reports in her quarters. She planned to surprise Seven with a long walk on the holodeck in a few hours.</P>
<P>She looked up in surprise as Seven strode into her quarters. Something was clearly upsetting the woman.</P>
<P>"Seven, what's wrong? Has anything happened?" Her concern was evident, but Seven was so caught up in her fury that she didn't notice.</P>
<P>"You are prepared to spend time with Paris, laughing and joking with him," Seven bit out. Her implacable blue gaze was ice-cold. "You touched him, you... you kissed him." The ex-drone was furious and showing it. B'Elanna couldn't get a word in edgewise.</P>
<P>"Seven, he was ..."</P>
<P>"Do not attempt to deny it, B'Elanna Torres, you are still in love with him." Seven accused. She actually felt as if her cardiac muscle was going to cease to function. She was hurting, badly.</P>
<P>"Seven, calm down and listen to me. You are just feeling a little insecure, that's all." </P>
<P>B'Elanna put down the reports that she had been reading and walked over to the statuesque woman. </P>
<P>"I never would have expected it, but I guess you're just a little jealous that's all." She ran her thumb over Seven's full lower lip.</P>
<P>Seven, however, was having none of it. She shoved the smaller woman away from her.</P>
<P>"Do not attempt to distract me. Do you still love Lieutenant Paris?"</P>
<P>"Seven, of course I do, I was married to him, he's been a friend for over six years ..."</P>
<P>She didn't get a chance to explain that she loved him but was no longer <B>in love</B> with him.</P>
<P>"You have been deceiving me all these months ..."</P>
<P>"Seven, stop..."</P>
<P>"You do not care for me, was this some form of punishment?"</P>
<P>"Seven. Stop it. Right now." B'Elanna was beginning to get annoyed herself.</P>
<P>"Why? Why should I trust you or believe you? You have given me no promises, no assurances. You are willing to kiss that, that insignificant little man in full view of every one but you resist even holding my hand in public."</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes, it was true.</P>
<P>"Despite my promise that I would wait, you have made no attempt to resolve your aversion to me."</P>
<P>"Seven, will you stop and listen for one goddamned minute," The Klingon temper could only be held at bay for so long.</P>
<P>"It has only been a few weeks since we discovered what we felt for each other. We agreed to wait for your sake as well as mine." B'Elanna stalked around her quarters, she was good and angry herself now.</P>
<P>"Look at you, you're still a virgin for christsakes. You have absolutely no experience of sex or sexuality or anything. You don't know what you want right now."</P>
<P>Seven grabbed B'Elanna by the shoulders roughly and pulled her up close.</P>
<P>"I know that I want you and you are denying me. You are denying both of us. I never thought that you could be such a coward."</P>
<P>That really stung. B'Elanna pulled herself away.</P>
<P>"Is that what this is about, Seven?  You have an itch that needs scratching? You wanna fuck right now then? B'Elanna was so angry that she couldn't help herself. </P>
<P>Neither could Seven. Her Borg enhanced hand shot out and back-handed B'Elanna across the face. The force lifted the engineer clear across the room. There was a stunned silence from both of them.</P>
<P>Seven had a look of pure horror on her face at what she had done, but she was rooted to floor at the look of unbridled fury on the face of B'Elanna as she stumbled to her feet.</P>
<P>"I'm ... I'm so sorry. I..." Seven couldn't get the words out right. They sounded lame and stupid. In the recesses of her mind, she noted that the fury seemed to drain away from B'Elanna, but that fact didn't help any.</P>
<P>"Seven, I think you should leave." The words sounded muffled, but they were quite calm. Too calm.</P>
<P>Tears rushed to her eyes and Seven made no attempt to hide them. "Please let me help you."</P>
<P>"No, Seven, I want you to leave now." B'Elanna looked up at the stricken ex-drone, her blue eyes brimming with unshed tears and just wanted to go into her arms, but she didn't.</P>
<P>"We'll talk tomorrow, but for now, I just want you to go."</P>
<P>Seven nodded miserably and left, her head bowed.</P>
<P>As the doors closed, B'Elanna crumpled to the floor. She was too upset to cry. Of all the fights that she'd had with Seven, or anyone else for that matter, this was by far the worse. She wondered if that crashing noise was the sound of her twin hearts shattering.</P>
