<!-- New Frontier \ Part 8 -->

<p>Janeway sat at the edge of her desk, her legs crossed in front of her, looking at Tom Paris with a perplexed look on her face. She couldn't understand how such a talented young man could be such an asshole. She corrected herself. It is not right to think of your crew as assholes. However, Tom Paris was an asshole.</p>

		<p>He had been caught fighting with Chakotay this time, attacking him for no particular reason, and Chakotay was pressing charges. Janeway just couldn't understand it and knew that she would have to come up with a more proper punishment than cleaning.</p>

		<p>"Tom, I honestly don't know what to do with you. You are acting out in a most undignified way and going against many protocols that have been in place since the beginning of sailing across the open sea. You do not hit a fellow or commanding officer, ever. You have not only done that once aboard this ship, Tom, when you hit Harry, your supposed best friend, but when you just hit my second in command, Chakotay. Tell me your reasoning."</p>

		<p>"You won't understand."</p>

		<p>"Try me."</p>

		<p>"You see, you're her friend. You're both of their friends and you won't understand."</p>

		<p>"I thought that we were friends, too, Tom. But see, if they had done something like this, they would have been properly punished, too. I gave you leeway because Harry didn't press charges. I punished you by making you clean his quarters. Not too terribly difficult, but demeaning and I hoped that would send a message to you. What didn't you understand?"</p>

		<p>"It's not that... Captain, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. There would have been other women, but she would always be there. She would be my friend and we would always have each other."</p>

		<p>"Most people don't see relationships like that, Tom. You promised to be monogamous. You were not. She ended the relationship. However, I don't see why this has anything to do with why you hit Harry and Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"They remind me of her."</p>

		<p>"How so?"</p>

		<p>"Harry wants to comfort me but all he does is remind me that B'Elanna isn't there. Chakotay, he and B'Elanna knew each other forever."</p>

		<p>"Did he say something?"</p>

		<p>"No. Just talked to me like normal."</p>

		<p>"Mr. Paris, I'm going to confine you the brig for an amount of time yet to be determined, demote you to crewman, and you must talk to a counselor."</p>

		<p>"Who?"</p>

		<p>"Yet to be determined."</p>

		<p>"Will I be able to pilot the ship as a crewman?"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>"Dammit, Captain! That's the only thing I have left."</p>

		<p>"You had it, Crewman Paris. You need to think about your actions and behavior now. I will not allow you to continue to behave this manner while holding the alpha shift pilot rotation. Tuvok to ready room," she ended by tapping her comm badge.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Tom chose the perfect time to fly off the handle and attack Janeway, wrapping his hands around her neck. As her eyes started to bulge out, she kneed him in the groin. He doubled over in pain and backed up straight into Tuvok. He proceeded to hold him up and take him dispassionately to the brig where he was likely to be for quite a long time.</p>

		<p>Janeway got herself a glass of water as she regained her breath and rubbed her neck. The door chimed and she croaked, "Come."</p>

		<p>Chakotay walked in, concerned by what had just happened.</p>

		<p>"Did he hurt you?"</p>

		<p>"No, only himself," she said, gaining her voice again. "I'll be damned if I ever see him on the bridge again. If he gets out of the brig, he'll be in the bowels of the ship, scraping up mold."</p>

		<p>"Revenge, Kathryn?" he asked.</p>

		<p>"No, truth. I've given him too many allowances. We need two things now, besides someone to officiate the trial. A new pilot and a counselor."</p>

		<p>"You are going to attempt to counsel him?"</p>

		<p>"I'm not. Somebody else. I think there's something not right about Tom. I don't understand his behavior. I also don't want to confine him to the brig for the rest of the journey, no matter what he has done."</p>

		<p>"Understood."</p>

		<p>"It's 1600 hrs and I'm going home. Have any suggestions for either position on my desk tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

		<p>He followed her out of the ready room and she made a b-line for the turbolift. Ensign Nicole Lang followed her in."</p>

		<p>"Finishing your shift, Ensign?" Janeway asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am," she said with a smile.</p>

		<p>"Good."</p>

		<p>"Captain, if I could be so forward, may I cook you dinner tonight?"</p>

		<p>"My, that is forward," Janeway said with a smile.</p>

		<p>"I try."</p>

		<p>"You may, if you call me Kathryn when we are off duty. Would your roommate mind?"</p>

		<p>"Probably. Would you provide the setting?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, I would. Come by at 1900, if you would like."</p>

		<p>"Will do, Kathryn."</p>

		<p>"Very well, Nicole," Janeway said as she exited on her deck. She turned back towards to the turbolift only to see the doors closing on a very cute smile on Nicole's face.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"I can't go any further, Seven," B'Elanna said as she fell against Seven's shoulders.</p>

		<p>"You do not have enough endurance, Lanna."</p>

		<p>"We've been doing this all day, Seven. How could I possibly endure that?"</p>

		<p>"I have endured it."</p>

		<p>"But you have enhancements that allow you to endure it. Nanoprobes."</p>

		<p>"My nanoprobes have hardly anything to do with it. I am simply in better shape than you."</p>

		<p>"We've been chasing after Naomi since 1000, she has only rested once for lunch. It is now 1700 hrs."</p>

		<p>"I will speak with her, Lanna. We will take her back to her mother so you can take a nap."</p>

		<p>"I don't need a nap, Seven! I just need to rest."</p>

		<p>"So you do not wish to lay in bed with me," Seven asked with a devilishly innocent look on her face.</p>

		<p>"Oh! Naomi, it's time to go home. You're mom will have dinner ready for you at any time," Lanna said quickly. She amazingly had enough energy again. In fact, she had enough energy to get outside the ship and push it home.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Nicole, this is wonderful. What is it again?"</p>

		<p>"Mama Frizoli's Frightful Feast of Fuccini."</p>

		<p>"And what's in it?"</p>

		<p>"Too much to say. Nothing that'll kill you, though."</p>

		<p>"That's good," Kathryn said before she took another laugh. "Why didn't you take the ship's chef position when it was open?"</p>

		<p>"Neelix needed to do something. He's a good guy and he's not all that bad. People just complain too much."</p>

		<p>"But leola root?"</p>

		<p>Nicole started laughing, soft at first and when Kathryn questioned her, she laughed harder. She even snorted as Kathryn looked on with a distressed look on her face.</p>

		<p>"What is going on? Is there leola root in this food?"</p>

		<p>Nicole nodded and fell on the floor in a fit of giggles.</p>

		<p>"It doesn't even taste like it."</p>

		<p>"He... was cooking... it... wrong," Nicole sputtered, unable to get off the floor. Kathryn knelt down next to her on the floor and suddenly, Nicole turned serious. She pushed her brown hair away from her eyes and absent mindedly stroked her now exposed and very toned stomach.</p>

		<p>"Something wrong?" Kathryn asked, her voice a low timber. It sent shivers through Nicole and her breathing deepening.</p>

		<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

		<p>"Kathryn."</p>

		<p>"Kathryn, there's nothing wrong," she whispered.</p>

		<p>Janeway quirked up a corner of her mouth. Nicole took the opportunity to sit up and press her lips into the captain's. It was Janeway who made the kiss deeper, cradling Nicole's head in her hands and teasing her lips with her tongue. The need for air a moment or two later made them separate and look in each other's eyes.</p>

		<p>"Oh, my god," Kathryn said, desire clear in her voice.</p>

		<p>Nicole pulled her down for another kiss and pushed her down to the floor. It wasn't forceful, just loving. She didn't touch the captain anywhere but her waist and the top of her head, stroking her hair absentmindedly with her hand. Kathryn did the same as their lips danced in a slow, passionate ritual, their tongues playing with each other, teasing each other, not fighting each other.</p>

		<p>Kathryn moaned as Nicole pulled away and kissed her eyes and her forehead.</p>

		<p>"Did you plan on seducing me tonight?" Kathryn asked with a sexy laugh.</p>

		<p>"Yes," Nicole answered as she put her snuggled into the crook of Janeway's laugh.</p>

		<p>"Should I be worried?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know. Why would you be worried?"</p>

		<p>"That I let somebody affect me so quickly. That I let someone seduce me. What do you want from me?"</p>

		<p>"Your love. That's all."</p>

		<p>"You're asking for a lot."</p>

		<p>"Maybe, but I'm not asking for it now. I know it's very difficult for you to be involved with an ensign, although I was sure to look up any rules regarding any relationships between captains and their crew. There aren't any rules, just a general suggestion that you keep your private life separate from your professional one. I understand that completely and would never ask for any favors or extra consideration from the captain. What I'm asking is that you take a chance on me. I will take this as slowly as you want, Kathryn, but I will never lie to you and say that I'm not attracted to you."</p>

		<p>"Are you attracted to the position I have on this ship?"</p>

		<p>"I can say that I'm not, but that would be a lie. It's a part of who you are and I can't deny it. However, the last couple of days have taught me so much more about you. I can't believe how open and loving you can be. I've never heard a laugh so beautiful in my life. I am attracted to you, Kathryn Janeway, who happens to be the captain of this ship."</p>

		<p>"And you are an ensign."</p>

		<p>"Yes, but someday I'll be captain of my own vessel. You may be an admiral, but I will be a captain. Experience will get me there, as well as a job well done, but that can only happen when we get home. I don't want your job. I don't want anymore consideration that you would give any other person aboard this vessel."</p>

		<p>"You are very well spoken."</p>

		<p>"You are skirting the issue. Are you attracted to me?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, very much so," Kathryn purred.</p>

		<p>Nicole smiled and then leaned down and kissed Kathryn again, passionately. She held her close by placing a strong hand on the captain's hip. The captain ground her hips into Nicole's. They both felt the desire building inside of them, so much so that they felt the earth shake beneath them. When the red lights poured down on them and the klaxon's started sounding, they soon learned that it wasn't the passion, but the ship being attacked and put under red alert.</p>
