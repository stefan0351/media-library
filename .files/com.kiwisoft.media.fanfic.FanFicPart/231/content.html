<!-- Trick or Treat \ Part 1 -->

<p>&quot;Neelix, Neelix! Hey look what I found.&quot; Naomi screamed across the
mess hall while waving a data pad.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, honey?&quot; Neelix asked as he went to scoop the little
Katarian up in his arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Halloween&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hallow-what?&quot;</p>

<p>Confused and quite curious as to what this little girl was all excited
about, Neelix sat down at an empty table with Naomi on his lap.</p>

<p>&quot;Halloween, silly.&quot; Naomi said with all the patience of an eight
year old child. &quot;It's a human holiday, a very old one not celebrated any
more. It's about...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh a holiday, which means party and with the crew still feeling a
little anxious over the recent mutiny attempt, this could definitely put the
crew at ease and lift quite a few spirits.&quot; Neelix contemplated aloud already
planning the event in his head.</p>

<p>Putting Naomi back on her feet, Neelix stood to go start his proposal to the
Captain. Mumbling excitedly to himself he crossed the mess hall and walked into
the kitchen. As Neelix exited the kitchen again this time hands full of data
pads, he realized something. &quot;Wait, what exactly is Halloween and what
type of party am I suppose to throw?&quot;</p>

<p>Standing with her hands on her hips, Naomi waved the data pad at him.
&quot;Well, I was about to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>Neelix returned to their table and motioned for Naomi to sit.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, do go on.&quot; Neelix smiled and sat as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, you see Halloween was a time when children got dressed up in
different costumes and went around collecting candy...&quot;, referring to her
pad, Naomi continued to tell Neelix all about Halloween.</p>

<p>In the Captain's ready room, Neelix stood at parade attention with his hands
tightly clasped behind his back. The Captain on the other hand sat comfortably
in her chair behind the desk reading Neelix's request.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Neelix, this certainly does sound.. interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is Captain and fun too. With all the stress and uncertainty the
crew's been under lately, wondering if they can trust one another again, this
should definitely be something so silly it will make the crew forget the past
month or so and help them to... well, lighten up.&quot;</p>

<p>Looking up from the pad, Janeway wondered just how much the crew had been
affected by the recent mind control incident. Janeway knew the Maquis members
of the crew were not really responsible for the mutiny but how does the rest of
the crew feel about it. Trust on the ship had been diminishing slowly ever
since Tuvok's investigation. Perhaps moral was worse off than she thought.</p>

<p>&quot;You just might be right, Mr. Neelix. After starting a civil war within
the borg, Seven's near death experience, and a not so relaxing space race it's
time to get a little... silly.&quot; Janeway said, accompanying that last word
with a silly face of her own. She handed back the pad to Neelix with a huge grin
on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Make it so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, Ma'am.&quot; Neelix answered with a grin of his own.</p>

<p>The following day saw to it that the rumor of this Halloween party,
happening in less than a week, was all over the ship. Walking into the
conference room was Harry Kim and his best friend Tom Paris talking about what
else, but that damned rumor. Harry looked to be about as excited as Naomi was
when Neelix told her the Captain had approved of the party. But Tom looked as
though someone had stolen his favorite toy and killed his only pet.</p>

<p>&quot;So, Tom, you going to the Halloween party, or what?&quot; Harry tried
to lighten his mood.</p>

<p>&quot;No&quot; was the only response Harry got when both he and Tom sat down
next to each other. Other than the Captain and Tuvok, who were over in the
corner talking amongst themselves, they were the first to arrive.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not, Tom? Its suppose to be really silly and who does silly better
than Tom Paris?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think so, Harry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tom, I know she might be there but you can't keep hiding from her.
Yes, you see her for staff meetings but you still have to spend a lot of time
on this ship together and believe me its a small ship. You will eventually bump
into her so why not do it sooner rather than later? At least at the party there
will be lots of people around so it shouldn't be that uncomfortable.&quot;
Harry reasoned with Tom, trying desperately to get him out of this funk he'd
been in for days. It seemed that during the mutiny an ensign from Astrometrics
had let it slip to B'Elanna in a disparaging comment about Starfleet officers
and their loyalties, that Tom Paris had slept with Jennifer Delaney about a
month before he proposed to B'Elanna. At that point in their relationship, Tom
and B'Elanna had been arguing a lot. The latest being that B'Elanna had
volunteered for the extremely dangerous away mission to get assimilated by the
borg. Tom didn't like not being asked if it was okay with him for B'Elanna to
volunteer. When confronted about the infidelity, Tom argued that it had been
because they were fighting so much and he needed comfort but that was in the
past and his proposal was for the future. B'Elanna had some doubts about
continuing her relationship with Tom even before the proposal, as well as,
after and they were proven correct with Tom's betrayal. So since the marriage was
no more than an agreement, there had not been a ceremony because of one thing
or another, B'Elanna had just called it off, leaving Tom in the wallowing mess
he was in now.</p>

<p>Harry looked at Tom with pleading eyes and Tom knew that if he didn't give
in now, Harry would just continue to pester him about going. 'Maybe he's right,
maybe I need to get out and try to move on. Obviously B'Elanna didn't have
trouble forgetting about me. After all there are plenty of fish in the sea.'
Tom tried to gain some of his bravado back.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Harry. You win, I'll go.&quot; Tom said with a sigh, only now
wondering what he was getting himself into.</p>

<p>After hearing Tom's relenting, Harry jumped right into a conversation about
what costumes to wear.</p>

<p>About a half hour later the staff meeting was just about concluded except
for one more matter Janeway wanted to bring up.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, people. Now about this Halloween party.&quot;</p>

<p>Groans were heard across the table and the Captain guessed that this group
was tired of hearing about it, all except Harry and Neelix that is.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm all sure you've heard all about this party Neelix is throwing so I
won't go into great detail about it.&quot; Sighs of relief was the response
that Janeway got. She even thought she heard one from Tuvok.</p>

<p>&quot;But I do want to say one thing. I expect to see ALL of you there and
in full costume,&quot; holding her hands up to stop the protests from Seven,
B'Elanna, and Tuvok, &quot;I know recently has been a very trying time but this
is the perfect opportunity to relax and perhaps even get silly. We are all over
due for some R &amp; R and I wish I didn't have to make this mandatory but
knowing the dedicated crew I have I'm going to have to. So I will be seeing you
all there and can't wait to see what creative costumes you choose to wear.
Dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone gathered there things and filed out all the while grumbling under
their breaths. And the Captain was left alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that went easier than I thought it would.&quot; Just then a
chill went up her spine. 'What was that old phrase... I think someone just walked
over my grave.' Which could only mean one thing. This was definitely not going
to be easy in the least.</p>
