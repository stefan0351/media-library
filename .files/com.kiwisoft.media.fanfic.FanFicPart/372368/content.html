TEN</b></p>
<p>"<i>Tonight I saw a side of you that I'd like to see more of, if you'll let me."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Of course I will." Miley said softly, "I want that more than anything."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Are you ready to open your eyes?"</i></p>
<p><i>Miley nodded eagerly. "Hell yes. I've been waiting for it all night."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Okay, then." Lilly relented, "Go ahead, open them."</i></p>
<p><i>Miley dropped her hands to her lap and revealed bright blue-grey eyes that clouded in confusion as she turned her body to face her friend. "Um, Lil… what are you giving me?" she asked, noting the lack of anything that looked even remotely close to a present.</i></p>
<p>"<i>I'm giving you the </i><b>real</b> <i>Lilly Truscott."</i></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>All Miley could hear was the <i>thump, thump, thumping</i> of her heart in her ears even as Lilly started to speak again. She simply could not focus on anything other than the beautiful girl in front of her because she was connecting the dots in her mind, which was reeling at her best friend's words.</p>
<p>"—is that okay with you?"</p>
<p>Miley shook her head and looked up to meet Lilly's eyes. "What did you say?"</p>
<p>"I was just – wondering if this is okay with you?" Lilly asked, waving between them.</p>
<p>"Yes." Miley said seriously, leaning forward to kiss her softly. "Best birthday present <i>ever</i>. This is – god, this is amazing, Lilly. <i>You're</i> amazing. I love you."</p>
<p>She then fell silent, her admission hanging heavily in the air. "…I'm not going to take that back and say that I don't mean it, Lilly." Miley said finally. "I do mean it. I love you." She dropped her eyes to her lap as Lilly sat across from her, silent.</p>
<p>"Miley, when I said I was giving you the real me, I meant every part of me." Lilly said, resting her hand on Miley's thigh. "My body." She leaned over and engaged Miley in an open-mouthed kiss, her tongue brushing against Miley's before she broke away and added, "And my heart."</p>
<p>"So, uh, what were you thinking could get rid of the dreams?" Miley cleared her throat as Lilly leaned back a few inches. She was still entirely too close to think clearly.</p>
<p>Lilly lifted an eyebrow, her lips forming a small smile. "Well, I was thinking… maybe if you got a taste of the real Lilly, you won't be so… dependent on the fake one."</p>
<p>"You mean…" Miley exhaled slowly, not quite grasping what Lilly was telling her.</p>
<p>"Miley…" Lilly rolled her eyes good-naturedly, "Make love to me."</p>
<p>Miley's mouth went dry as Lilly's words registered. "Are you sure, Lilly? Usually people – I mean, shouldn't we wait?"</p>
<p>"Why would we wait?" Lilly asked, "We've known each other for seven years, and we've been best friends since the day we met. We know everything about each other. I love you, and you love me… unless you don't want to do this with me?"</p>
<p>"I do! I'm just saying that it seems a little rushed." Miley explained quietly.</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and stood up. "All right. Don't worry about it, Miley, it's fine."</p>
<p>Miley averted her eyes as Lilly changed into a pair of short shorts and a t-shirt, lifting her head when Lilly crawled into bed next to her. Moonlight filtered into the room, falling across Lilly's still form as she lay on her side facing away from Miley.</p>
<p>The brunette then did the same, changing into her own outfit that somewhat mirrored Lilly's. She then lay down next to Lilly, resting her head on her hands as she stared at her girlfriend's back. What was she doing, letting this opportunity go to waste? Was she doing the right thing by waiting?</p>
<p>What Lilly said was true. They were already close as two best friends could be, and they'd taken the next step to starting a relationship. The next step was… it was intimidating. Miley wanted to be with Lilly in every way possible, there was no doubt about that. But she was so caught up in her dreams, in the images her brain conjured up every night. Actually making love to Lilly would be so different to Lilly fucking her in her dreams. Was she really ready for that?</p>
<p>"Hey, Lilly?" Miley whispered, poking her girlfriend in the side.</p>
<p>Lilly jerked at the contact, grunting in response. "Hmm?"</p>
<p>"I love you, Lilly."</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miley." Lilly responded softly. "Now are you going to cuddle me or not?"</p>
<p>Miley grinned and scooted closer, both of them shifting so Miley could wrap her arms completely around Lilly from behind and hold her close.</p>
<p>"You're a lot better at cuddling than Beary is." Miley told her after a moment, "And a lot cuter."</p>
<p>"I'd hope so. I'm a lot less hairy than he is, too." Lilly responded, shaking with silent laughter. "Goodnight, Miley."</p>
<p>"Goodnight." Miley echoed as she buried her face against Lilly's neck, pressing her lips to the warm skin. She felt Lilly shiver beneath her as she planted more soft kisses against her neck, each one longer than the one before.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, Miles?" Lilly asked weakly.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Miley slid one of her hands beneath Lilly's shirt. Her fingers danced across Lilly's stomach – toned from years of sports, firm beneath her fingertips. Lilly gasped as Miley's fingers glided farther up, running over her ribs.</p>
<p>"Does you offer still stand?" Miley whispered before her lips closed around Lilly's earlobe, tugging it lightly with her teeth.</p>
<p>"Yes." Lilly breathed out, rolling over to face Miley.</p>
<p>They crashed their lips together, Lilly's hands coming up to grab fistfuls of Miley's dark curls to pull her infinitely closer. As their mouths parted, she moaned into Miley's mouth.</p>
<p>Miley then pulled back, her eyes locked onto Lilly's. "I want to do this with you, girlfriend. I'm ready if you are."</p>
<p>Lilly grinned back at her, nodding. "Yes, I'm ready."</p>
<p>Miley dipped her head and kissed Lilly, then broke away as they slowly removed each other's clothes, taking in every detail of the exposed skin. Lilly then pulled Miley down on top of her, her hand wrapping around her neck as she pulled the brunette into a searing kiss.</p>
<p>"You are so beautiful," Lilly whispered against Miley's lips. She reached up to cup one of Miley's breasts, flicking her thumb over her nipple. "You are <i>so</i> incredibly beautiful, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley dropped her head against Lilly's shoulder, groaning softly as Lilly moved her hands against her skin.</p>
<p>"I, ah, don't know what I'm supposed to do." Lilly then whispered, embarrassed as she moved her hands from Miley's breasts to her back.</p>
<p>"It's okay." Miley responded quietly, lifting her head from Lilly's shoulder. "Have you ever done… anything before?"</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head. Miley then smiled at her and kissed her, trailing one of her hands over her chest. Lilly sighed as Miley's fingers tweaked her nipple into a hard peak, her sigh turning into a sharp gasp as Miley lowered her head and closed her lips around the other nipple. Lilly dug her nails into Miley's back as she began to rapidly flick her tongue over the tip, one of her hands tangling in the brunette's long hair as Lilly tried to pull the other girl closer.</p>
<p>Miley lifted her mouth, releasing Lilly's nipple with a <i>pop</i>. Her mouth covered Lilly's as she lowered her other hand, sliding it slowly down her stomach until she reached the patch of hair just above where she desperately wanted to be. Lowering her hand just a bit lower, she started forming circles around Lilly's clit. The blonde gasped loudly, her chest rising and falling rapidly at the shock coursing through her.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Miley whispered, pausing for a moment.</p>
<p>Lilly jerked her head up and down. "Yes, I'm – I'm good, it's just… <i>wow</i>."</p>
<p>Miley grinned as she moved again, lowering her head to press her lips against Lilly's neck. She sucked and nibbled at the girl's skin, smiling to herself as she found Lilly's spot. She then slowly lowered her fingers, slowly entering Lilly.</p>
<p>Both of Lilly's hands flew to Miley's back, gripping her shoulders hard as Miley slid her fingers in and out of her, those long, slim fingers trying to move in a way that drove Lilly crazy. Miley knew she was doing it right as Lilly once again pulled her down into a kiss.</p>
<p>"Do it like that," Lilly whispered hotly against her lips, "Right… there, Miles."</p>
<p>Miley started rubbing Lilly's clit with her thumb as she moved inside of her, keeping up the pleasurable action up for a few long minutes until Lilly tensed beneath her.</p>
<p>"It's too much…" Lilly whimpered, "Miley, it's too much."</p>
<p>"Shh… it's okay, babe." Miley told her, "<i>Just breathe</i>."</p>
<p>However, she then removed her fingers and scooted down on the bed. She bent Lilly's legs and spread them apart, holding her down with one arm as she lowered her head to Lilly's clit. Her mouth closed around it and Lilly bucked her hips. She flailed around as Miley flicked her tongue over her clit, one hand holding Miley to her, the other grabbing a pillow to hold against her face as she reached her climax.</p>
<p>Miley smiled against her, but couldn't bring herself to stray away from the space between Lilly's legs. She took a moment to let Lilly relax and catch her breath, but as soon as the blonde removed the pillow from her face, she dove back in and repeated her previous actions. She couldn't tear herself away even for a moment. Lilly was… intoxicating; she tasted <i>incredible</i>.</p>
<p>"Miley, Miley, <i>Miley</i>…" Lilly whimpered. "Oh, God, <i>Miles</i>!"</p>
<p>Miley slid her fingers into Lilly, who instantly started moving with Miley. It didn't take long for her to come again, screaming into a pillow, and Miley took in all of Lilly's wetness, moaning at the overwhelming taste of her girlfriend.</p>
<p>Lilly clawed at her, pulling her upward. "I love you."</p>
<p>Miley grinned down at the blonde girl, her hair out of place and her beautiful body covered in sweat. She laid down next to the girl and licked Lilly off of her fingers.</p>
<p>"Finger lickin' good," Miley whispered, smirking. "The Colonel would be proud."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed softly before being pulling her into a soft kiss. Lilly ran her fingertips along Miley's side, the skin as slick with sweat as her own. She trailed her fingers up Miley's side, over her arms that instantly broke out into goosebumps, and cupped her face as she continued to kiss her. Eventually she pulled back and brushed the hair off of Miley's forehead, tucking loose strands behind her ears.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to see if the real thing is as good as your dreams?" Lilly asked her softly, dropping her hand to Miley's breast. Miley inhaled sharply at the touch, her eyes sliding shut. "I take that as a yes?"</p>
<p>Miley wordlessly nodded, her lips parting slightly as Lilly pushed her onto her back. The blonde propped herself up on one elbow as she echoed Miley's earlier actions, stroking one nipple into hardness with her fingers as she took the other one into her mouth. Lilly then progressed quickly, almost immediately placing her hand over Miley's center. She slid her fingers down before finding her clit.</p>
<p>"You're… so… wet." Lilly whispered in amazement. She moved to hover over Miley as her fingers entered Miley with ease, her mind reeling at how tight the girl beneath her was.</p>
<p>"Sweet nibblets." Miley hissed as she arched her back almost violently, resting her hands on Lilly's hips as she started to rock against the fingers moving inside of her. "Go faster," she pleaded after a minute or two.</p>
<p>"Would you rather I… go down…?" Lilly muttered, almost self-conscious at her inexperience. "Would you like that?"</p>
<p>"I'd love just about anything you do to me, Lilly." Miley responded, moving her hands to Lilly's butt. She dug her nails in, dragging them up and onto her back.</p>
<p>Lilly jerked, enjoying the feeling immensely. "I think I want to try it. It felt really, <i>really</i> good," she dipped her head to kiss Miley deeply, "I want to make you feel good, Miles."</p>
<p>"Go for it." Miley whimpered as Lilly withdrew herself. She instantly reached down and wrapped her fingers around Lilly's wrist, pulling it up and into her mouth, wrapping her lips around one of Lilly's fingers and tasting herself.</p>
<p>Lilly watched with a dry mouth as Miley licked herself off of her finger, the brunette's eyes burning into hers as she did so. Miley then pushed Lilly's wrist toward her and Lilly didn't hesitate in doing the same with her other finger.</p>
<p>"Let's get this show on the road." Miley said, trembling in anticipation as Lilly crawled down her body, leaving hot, open-mouthed kisses against her stomach as she did so. And then Lilly's mouth was hot against her and Miley bit down on her fist to keep from screaming out. Lilly's movements were hesitant as she started, but she remembered the way Miley made her feel and she followed her basic instinct.</p>
<p>"Use the pillow, silly." Lilly said, lifting her head from Miley for only a second.</p>
<p>Apparently Miley took her advice because as hard as she was shaking from the pleasure Lilly was bringing her, there was no way she'd be able to stop herself from screaming out. Lilly was surprised that Miley could last as long as she did, Miley finally arching her back and coming hard after many long minutes. She wasn't completely able to stifle the scream that erupted from her lips, almost animalistic in its nature. Lilly was taken aback as Miley came, not really expecting the wetness that she produced, but she leaned forward and lapped it up anyway. <i>Oh,</i> <i><b>wow</b></i><i>.</i> Lilly thought to herself at the taste of what was purely Miley.</p>
<p>Miley threw the pillow down on the bed beside her, getting her breathing under control. Lilly propped herself up on her elbows as she looked up Miley, whose arms were on the bed above her head. The blonde licked her lips as she gazed at her girlfriend's body, crawling back up her beautiful form and going back for more of Miley's breasts.</p>
<p>One of Miley's hands started to stroke Lilly's hair softly. "Lil… come up here."</p>
<p>Lilly pouted as she pulled herself away from what was becoming her favorite part of Miley's body, but gladly laid down on her side next to her. Miley instantly curled into her, pressing their lips together in a deep kiss. They remained like that for what seemed like an hour, and probably was, before splitting. Lilly laid on her back and drew Miley into her arms, wrapping them around the other girl's trembling body as she buried her head into the crook of Lilly's neck.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you've never done that before?" Miley murmured, almost purring as Lilly stroked her back lovingly.</p>
<p>"I could ask you the same thing." Lilly returned, "But I think I know the answer to that…"</p>
<p>"Technically, I haven't." Miley quipped, "I'll admit that I have, uh, educated myself on certain things, but I haven't done this with anyone else. It's just you. It's always been you, Lilly."</p>
<p>"Charmer," Lilly said, "…What do you mean, you <i>educated</i> yourself?"</p>
<p>"Besides the obvious?" Miley asked with a grin, "Um, do you remember a couple weeks ago? We found a DVD and I said it was Jackson's?"</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes widened as she looked at the top of Miley's head. "That was yours? I was ready to tear into Jackson for leaving his girl-on-girl movies around."</p>
<p>"I know." Miley admitted, "I would've let you do it, too, consequences be damned. He still doesn't know about that."</p>
<p>"Mm, good." Lilly muttered, her eyes sliding shut as Miley drew shapes on her stomach. "Let me know how tonight goes, okay?"</p>
<p>Miley tilted her head up and covered Lilly's lips with her own. They kissed deeply for several minutes, Miley keeping Lilly in the kiss, not ready to separate from her lover yet.</p>
<p>"I will." Miley told her, settling back down against Lilly with a wide, content smile on her face. "Love you, Lil."</p>
<p>"Love you too, Miles." Lilly murmured before drifting into an easy sleep.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Sunlight filtered into the bedroom, falling across Lilly's sleeping face. Her nose scrunched and her eyes flickered before finally opening slowly. She felt a warm body all around her, two arms wrapped tightly around her – definitely not how she fell asleep, but the feeling was welcomed.</p>
<p>"Morning, sunshine." Miley brushed her lips against Lilly's ear before pressing a kiss to her cheek. "How'd you sleep?"</p>
<p>Lilly groaned softly, stretching as much as she could in Miley's arms. "I slept in your arms. It was wonderful, of course. How about you?"</p>
<p>"…I think I had the best night's sleep I've had in five months." Miley admitted.</p>
<p>"No dreams?" Lilly asked, looking up at Miley with a hopeful smile.</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "No dreams." She confirmed.</p>
<p>She was startled when Lilly was suddenly on top of her, every inch of their skin pressed together, their legs a messy tangle of limbs as Lilly cupped her jaw and planted kisses all over her face. Miley erupted into laughter, thoroughly enjoying everything Lilly was giving her.</p>
<p>"I'm… just… so… happy…" Lilly murmured between kisses against Miley's lips, cheeks, nose and forehead. "Now… you… can't… knock… my… ideas."</p>
<p>"You had no idea if it would work, did you?" Miley deadpanned.</p>
<p>"Nope." Lilly answered, "I figured it was worth a shot, and if it didn't… well, I'd still want to share such a special thing with you, Miley. That wouldn't have changed."</p>
<p>"No regrets?" Miley asked softly.</p>
<p>"Absolutely not." Lilly told her firmly, poking her nose lightly, "I wouldn't take back what we did for the world."</p>
<p>"Thank you for giving me a chance." Miley said after a few moments of silence, "I don't know what the hell I did to deserve you, but I'd do it a million times to wake up like this for the rest of my life."</p>
<p>Lilly was silent for a moment. "I would too, Miley. I want you, and I know that this is what I want. I want to be with you for the rest of our lives and whatever comes after that. I <i>need</i> to be with you."</p>
<p>"Just what are you proposing?" Miley asked playfully, brushing strands of hair out of Lilly's face.</p>
<p>"I propose that we finish out our senior year and after that… I buy you a ring – when I manage to save up some money, of course." Lilly said. "Sounds like a good plan, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. It really does." Miley whispered, her eyes stinging with unshed tears. "I love you, Lilly Truscott."</p>
<p>"And I love you, Miley Ray." Lilly echoed lovingly, kissing her softly. "…So when are we gonna tell your dad?"</p>
<p>Miley bit her bottom lip, trying to stifle a grin and a wave of heat from filling her cheeks. "I think it's safe to say we don't actually, um, <i>have </i>to tell him."</p>
<p>"Miley…"</p>
<p>"At least you weren't the one he heard screamin' at the top of her lungs." Miley murmured, embarrassed. She then added happily, "He gave us his blessing, though! Can you believe he <i>texted</i> me about it? Awkward."</p>
<p>"True." Lilly looked down at the girl beneath her, taking in every detail. "I can honestly say I wouldn't have it any other way, though. I kind of like being able to do this without your dad barging in."</p>
<p>"Doing what? Just laying here?" Miley questioned, lifting an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Among other things." Lilly grinned, "Would you mind <i>educating</i> me some more?"</p>
<p>"I think that can be arranged." Miley said, "And for the record, I prefer the real Lilly Truscott. I think she's pretty great."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, remembering the first time Miley had told her that only four years ago. It was good to know that Miley did, too.</p>
<p>"Now… lesson one." Miley started with a searing kiss against Lilly's lips, "You're lucky, Miss Truscott. I pass all my students. Or should I say <i>student</i>?" She placed her hands on Lilly's butt and squeezed, watching in amusement as Lilly squirmed and pressed her body down into Miley's. "Shall we begin?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>END</b></p>
<p><b><hr size=1 noshade></b></p>
<p><b>Well, this is the end. I just want to say thanks to all of you who favorited this and put it on alert. But most of my thanks goes to those of you who reviewed (especially to Stephanie/Don't Label Me!). Ya'll are just so awesome and you've inspired me to keep going with this even though I've been kind of down lately, so thanks for keeping me writing.</b></p>
<p><b>I kind of got sucked into this one, and I have to say that I'm really into writing... um, dirtier things lately, so it's safe to say that I'll be back with what I like to call the "lileysex" in the near future (as well as so many other ideas I've been working on). I won't be writing a sequel to this or if I do it won't be for a LONG time, but I have some things up my sleeve that I'll be posting really soon. Anyway, thank you and see you soon!</b></p>
