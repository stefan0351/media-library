<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 27 -->

<p>Brooke tussled her hair and pursed her lips looking into the mirror again.
Spinning around dramatically she tried several different poses, all
determined to discover whether or not her pants made her ass look big.
After that she entered into a whole new series of poses designed to
determine whether or not her hips looked big, her chest looked flat and her
claves looked bovine-ish.  Finally, once she was satisfied that everything
looked in proportion, she tussled her hair some more.</p>

<p>“How do I look?” Brooke asked finally spinning around to look at the other
occupant of the room.</p>

<p>“Gwyneth herself would be envious of your radiance tonight,” Nicole replied
with a wicked grin.  “Very nice.  How about me?” she asked spinning around
so that Brooke could get a good look at the magnificence that was her.</p>

<p>“Very Charlize Theron a la Oscars double nines, sexy and stylish.  Two
thumbs up,” Brooke responded smiling.</p>

<p>Turning back to the mirror Brooke smoothed out her shirt and looked at
herself contemplatively again.  There was something slightly narcissistic
about the amount of time she had spent in front of the mirror that night,
but she couldn’t help it.  “You think Sam’ll like it?” she asked Nicole
meditatively as she turned her head to the side.</p>

<p>“She has eyes right?” Nicole responded watching Brooke begin to primp and
preen again with a  touch of amazement.  Not for the first time she
considered the oddity that was Brooke and Sam’s relationship.  She just
didn’t understand what Brooke saw in Sam and her adventures in open-mouthed
journalism.  She wasn’t blind, she could see that Sam was attractive young
woman, after a beer or two Nicole was even fairly certain that she could do
Sam if the girl managed to not open her big, fat mouth.  But loosened
inhibitions didn’t explain Brooke and Sam.  As much chagrin as it caused
her, Nicole had to admit that Brooke seemed to be in love with Sam, and Sam
seemed to be in love with her too.  She had to acknowledge that they
genuinely liked each other as people and had a mutual respect for each
other.  The only way that she could comprehend that was to repeat to
herself,  “the universe is a strange and wonderful place”, so that’s what
she did.</p>

<p>Nicole was interrupted from her thoughts when she sensed Brooke move behind
her.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re coming,” Brooke stated simply.  She was now certain that
nothing short of death—or boarding school if their parents were to find out
what they were up to—would separate her from Sam again, and that being the
case she decided that she had to start trying to merge their worlds
together.  It was easier for her in enter Sam’s world as Carmen already
liked her, Lily was fairly indifferent to her and Harrison, well she wasn’t
really sure about him anymore but he wasn’t openly hostile.  It was going to
be a little bit tougher for Sam she was sure, which was why she had asked
Nicole to join them on their excursion.  After herself, Nicole was the big
cheese as far as the social order went and she knew that if she could get
Nicole to at least tolerate Sam’s presence the rest of the flock would fall
into order because they wouldn’t want to rock the boat.  It was the how to
get Nicole and Sam getting along part worried Brooke, but this was a start.</p>

<p>“Please, it’s lady’s night,” Nicole responded swishing around to face
Brooke.  The truth was Nicole was a firm believer that in today’s world of
broken homes and nuclear families, ones friends became their family.  That
being the case, Brooke was her family, and as such certain considerations
had to be made though she loathed to do it.  Despite her momentary lapse
into supreme bitchiness, Brooke really was the most important person in
life—sad as it was.  So, if it meant that she had to be civil towards Spam,
she would do it, grudgingly.  Plus, it really was lady’s night.</p>

<p>“We should go,” Brooke said glancing at her clock.  “We’re late.”</p>

<p>“I’m not the one that spent two hours getting dressed for someone who’s
already seen me naked,” Nicole responded swishing out the door fabulously—as
always.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” Brooke responded pouting a bit as they made their way down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Jane and Mike were in the living room and came out to greet the girls as
they descended.  They too were dressed for a night on the town.  Brooke
frowned, she hadn’t known they were going anywhere.  If she had known *they*
were going somewhere *she* wouldn’t have been going anywhere!</p>

<p>“Looking good Big Mac,” Nicole commented patting Mr. McQueen on the shoulder
and winking at him.  Brooke sighed and shook her head, it really disturbed
her when Nicole did this.  Flirting was one thing, flirting with her father
was another thing.  It was just, well gross.</p>

<p>“You look nice,” Brooke commented turning to face Jane who seemed slightly
amused by Mike’s discomfort.  She needed to distract herself, Nicole was
telling Mike how ‘strapping’ he looked, which meant that she was moments
away from hyperventilating and passing out.  This had to be avoided at all
costs.</p>

<p>“Thank you, you don’t look to shabby yourself,” Jane responded smiling.  She
was actually glad that the girls were spending some time apart.  Not that
she wasn’t one for family togetherness, she just wasn’t really big on too
much family togetherness.  And, she figured the less time they spent
together, the faster Sam’s infatuation with Brooke would pass.  This having
separate plans thing pleased her immensely.</p>

<p>“Oh, this old thing,” Brooke replied ignoring the look Nicole sent her.</p>

<p>After another moment of exchanging pleasantries Brooke began to herd Nicole
out the door.  “Have fun,” she called back to the parental units as she
headed out the door, “and don’t wait up.” With that the blondes vanished
from their world.</p>

<p>“Freedom,” Brooke purred as she slipped into the plush leather of Nicole’s
car.</p>

<p>“Even better, ‘Sirens’,” Nicole responded as she started the car up.</p>

<p>“Where did you hear about this place anyway?” Brooke asked.  Nicole merely
smiled and pulled out of the drive way.  Yeah, tonight was definitely going
to be fun.</p>

<p>Sam ran her hands over her shirt—not that there was much shirt to run her
hands over—and exhaled sending strands of her hair flying about her face.
Taking another look in the mirror she observed herself for a moment before
deciding that this was as good as it was going to get.  Turning around she
observed the other occupants of the room who were finishing up them selves.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” Sam said drawing their attention to her.  “Do I have my skank on
or what?”</p>

<p>“Two words: Fab Bu,” Carm responded before letting out a little whistle.</p>

<p>“Are you sure I look trashy enough?” Sam asked looking herself up and down.
“After all, we are going to a club downtown, and eleven is when the ho
parade begins.”  Truthfully, she didn’t really care about proper club
wardrobe, she just wanted to look delectable.  She wanted to look hot, dead
sexy and all that good stuff.  She wanted to drive Brooke crazy.</p>

<p>“Let me put it this way,” Lily responded running a hand threw her hair
tousling it a little.  “I’d do you,” she continued receiving grins from both
Carm and Sam.  She smirked to herself amused by the fact that they didn’t
know she was only half joking.</p>

<p>“Any glaring fashion faux paus?” Sam asked thinking that the outfit was
coordinated as far as she could tell.  “With the fashion Nazi coming with
us, I can’t be clashing,” she continued.</p>

<p>“You’re clash free, not that it matters since Brooke would probably think
you looked delicious in a burlap sack,” Carmen responded. And it was true.
The fact was that she wanted a boyfriend just like Brooke.  “That girls got
it bad for you,”  she continued enjoying the flush that came to Sam’s face.
Deciding however to give her break, she then asked “Moving on, question.
Why is Satan…I mean Nicole coming anyway?”</p>

<p>Sam smirked.  “I think Brooke wants us to bond.  Or you know at least stop
her from referring to me as Spam and me from referring to her as Smug Bitch
,” she answered shaking her head.  She had really gotten attached to calling
Nicole Smug Bitch too, it rolled of the tongue with the greatest of ease,
conveying everything Sam felt for the girl in one neat little package.  It
was as close to perfection as anything had ever come and she was going to
have to give it up.</p>

<p>“Yeah, and next week we can solve the problem of world hunger,” Lily
commented sarcastically.  Then again, she had never thought that Brooke and
Sam would learn to get along.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget overpopulation, and the destruction of the Amazon,” Carmen
added.  “We can tackle those after we all start getting along with Mary
Cherry,” she continued.  “Right Lil’ Lily?” she asked smiling her friend
winningly.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” Lily responded pouting.  “I wasn’t tryin’ to kiss her!” she
continued defensively.  “And who the hell is Joe anyway?”</p>

<p>“Well have to discuss that later,” Carmen responded taking a look out the
window.   “The cavalry has arrived…and it got a new paint job.”</p>
