<P>a/n: okay, there's gonna be one more chapter after this. Then this is done, and I might try to think of another story to write. I had an idea earlier but idr it now…</P><P>Chapter Eleven; BEFORE THE STORM</P><P>'God I can't believe I didn't at least say bye to her…I can't believe it.' I thought harshly to myself, 'She's going to be devastated in the morning…all I did was leave that stupid note…I was so…stupid.'</P><P>"Lilly, will you stop sulking? It's going to ruin your face," Lilly's mom said from across the table. "Just because you had to leave your little girlfriend is no reason to be so upset."</P><P>"Mom…" I spat, "You don't know anything."</P><P>"Oh Lilly, you can go back next summer is fine." Her mom rolled her eyes, flipping threw a magazine. "We'll be landing soon in Malibu."</P><P>I sighed, knowing I won't be back next summer, 'Mom hates going anywhere twice…we'll be as far away from Tennessee next year as we can get. And Miley won't be able to come visit me, home-schooled or not she wouldn't be able to come out to Cali.' I thought, looking out my window down at California as they flew over it. 'Miley won't ever be able to come here…she's too busy…'</P><p style="text-align:center;">~Two Years Later~</P><P>The plane landed in the small Tennessee airport nearby Crowley Corners, "Thanks, Ted." I called to the pilot.</P><P>"Ms. Truscott, are you sure you won't be needing a flight home?" He asked me.</P><P>"No, if I do…well, I'll just take a regular flight, but I have a feeling I am home."</P><P>He gave me a funny look, but helped me get my luggage off the plane. "Well, here you are Ms. Truscott, and there's your car you ordered and the air port had delivered for you."</P><P>"Thank you… so much," I hugged him quickly. "Good luck with my mother at home."</P><P>He smiled, "Well…good luck to you Ms. Truscott…out here." He looked around at the fields, and farms surrounding the small airport.</P><P>"Thank you," I grinned and started loading my luggage into the bed of the little pick-up truck I had bought before I arrived.</P><P>"Well, I'll see you sometime soon maybe." He nodded, and headed back to the plane my mother owns.</P><P>I got into the little truck, 'It sure is good to be back here.' I started the drive towards the Stewart Bed and Breakfast that I located on the GPS in the truck.</P><P>I parked in the parking lot by the bed and breakfast, jumping out of the truck I ran towards the stables, "Hello?" I called out not seeing anybody except the horses. I ran up to Cinnamon's stall, looking for Nellie. "Where's your baby at?" I frowned, then realized it's been two years since I've been here…and this slightly older looking Cinnamon was obviously no longer going to have Nellie with her. So I walked through the stables checking in each stall for somebody, "Hello?" I called out again.</P><P>"Hey." Somebody said behind me in a rough Tennessee accent, "You looking for somebody?"</P><P>I turned around, "Travis?" I grinned at him.</P><P>He looked confused, "Umm…yup, that's me."</P><P>"It's Lilly, Lilly Truscott. I was here like to summers ago." Wow, did everybody forget me?</P><P>His face lit up in recognition, "Ohh! Yeah, Lilly…" Then he frowned. "Wow…so uh, I guess you're looking for Miley huh?"</P><P>"Yeah, sort of." I said uncertainly.</P><P>"She's out in the fields right now," He nodded towards the path that me and Miley had at one point in time taken together almost daily. "Lemme get your horse."</P><P>I grinned at him, "So you remembered."</P><P>"How could I forget?" He chuckled, then a dark look passed across his face, but faded as soon as he came up to a stall. "Hey girl."</P><P>A large horse stuck her head out of the stall, and whinnied at me. I looked at the sign on her stall and saw a faded dusty sign hanging from it with, 'Nervous Nellie' painted across it. "Nellie." I smiled at her.</P><P>"She's not so much of a Nervous Nellie," He grinned, "So you're gonna have to be a little tough with her." He started throwing tack on her, and had her all set up and ready to go within fifteen minutes. "You know the way out there I'm guessing." He handed me the reins.</P><P>I took them, and swung up onto the saddle wondering how I was still able to do that after two years of not even seeing a horse. "I know the way." I took off at a gallop down the path towards Miley.</P><P>I pulled Nellie to a stop; jumping down from her saddle silently I landed on the ground and dropped her reins, letting her graze the grass on the bottom of the hill. I started walking up the hill trying to get a better view of the girl standing at the top of the hill, underneath a tree singing for a group of cows of the other side. I walked quietly, listening to her voice as it carried through the light breeze, I watched this curious…wonderous girl singing on top of this hill, I heard the ending of the songs verses drifting towards me, "Trying to keep the light from going out, And the clouds were ripping out my broken heart. They always say a heart is not a home without the one who gets you through the storm…Standing out in the rain knowing it's really over, Please don't leave me alone…I'm flooded with all this pain knowing that I'll never hold ya like I did before…the storm."</P><P>I felt a feeling of sadness overwhelm me, 'God I've caused her so much pain…'</P><P>"Thank you…Alfred." She said sadly, "You're my biggest fan."</P><P>"I'm your biggest fan." I said from behind her.</P><P>She spun around quickly, "Holy crap…" She breathed.</P><P>"Miley," I started saying, but then broke down crying.</P><P>"Lilly.." She ran the few feet separating us pulling me into an embrace, "Even though that was a slightly creepy way to acknowledge yourself standing behind me…god I've missed you."</P><P>I choked out a laugh through my tears, "I'm so sorry."</P><P>"For what?"</P><P>"Don't…Miley, you know what I'm talking about." I whined, "I'm sorry I left…I'm sorry I didn't come back…I'm so sorry just for everything…"</P><P>"But Lilly," She said softly, "You did come back."</P><P>"When? When did I come back?" I said angrily.</P><P>She laughed, "Right now Lilly, you came back now…'nd you don't know how happy that makes me."</P><P>"I should've come back sooner…"</P><P>"Now is better then never." She whispered, resting her chin on my shoulder.</P><P>"Why'd you wait for me? I didn't deserve it."</P><P>"'Cause Lilly…" She paused for a couple of seconds, "You really are worth it."</P><P>"You never came to visit me."</P><P>"I looked you up though…your mom's a multimillionaire 'nd you own one of the largest houses in Malibu, California."</P><P>"We don't deserve to be millionaire's…it's all because of my dad, he had millions invested in stocks and owned an oil company…then he died in a car crash coming home for the weekend from a long business trip. He left my mother five million dollars, and me two million in his will…I don't even want the money, but now that I'm eighteen…I have it." I told her sadly.</P><P>"I love you Lilly," Was all Miley said, then kissed me gently on the lips. "And you're so worth waiting for, I've missed you…and I hope you have longer to stay here than a month this time."</P><P>"I have a lifetime." I told her, "Or as long as you want me here."</P><P>"I'll take the first choice," She whispered.</P><P>a/n: and holyy crapp, you don't know how much I like that song 'Before The Storm' Miley sang with Nick jo-bro for some reason…I love it. But I dislike the jo-bros for the most part…</P><P>& WOW, I've been like loving lilly these past few days…usually I just like her, but I realized she's pretty cute too. Aww liley. It's so adorable.</P><P>-wait now I can't decide if I like this chapter as an ending or not…</P><P>So tell me…is this a good ending or should there be another chapter? Share your thoughts, and give me a review ;) !</P>
