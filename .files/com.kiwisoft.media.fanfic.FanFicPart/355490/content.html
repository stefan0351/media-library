<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 4 -->

<p>I have this birthday card with a picture of Dorothy and Toto. Oz is
my favorite movie. I got the card, along with the video, for my ninth
birthday. I got them from her. Sure they both gave me a bunch of
other stuff together, but this present was only from my mom. I threw
the video away a long, long time ago in one of my anger bursts, but
the card still sits in the back of my drawer together with a picture
of my mom. On the back of the card it reads simply `Mommy loves
Pookie.' That's what I called myself when I was way little.
`Pookie wants a cookie. Pookie is a pig girl.' And that's
what my mother called me when we were alone. No one else in the whole
world knows that.</p>

<p>She gave me the present late at night, after dad was already asleep.
She slept in my bed that night, and I was the happiest little girl in
the world. A week later she was gone.</p>

<p>The card is like this magical doorway to my childhood. Whenever I
study it, all kinds of things from the past come to life. There's
my dad a few years younger, my childhood friends most of whom I've
lost contact to. How did that happen? How come I didn't make ONE
lasting friendship as a child? Harrison is the only one of them I
even see anymore. And that's just because he lives next-door.</p>

<p>But most vividly it brings back my mother. In all her beauty. Through
my nine-year old eyes she looked like an angel, with golden hair and
a caring smile. Now with my extensive life experience I can see past
that beauty, I can see past the smile she always wore, I can see
straight into the sadness that always hid beneath the surface.
It's there in her eyes. It's in the picture I have in my
drawer. It's in every picture I've ever seen of her. And
it's in my memories. It was there when I was making those
memories, I just didn't know what to look for.</p>

<p>"What'ya got there?", Sam's voice comes only a few
feet behind me and scares me half to death. No wait, I was already
there to begin with.</p>

<p>Still, the surprise is enough to make my arm swing in a wide arc and
knock down a glass of water on my table. Quickly I recover the card
from the table and raise it up to safety, only to have it snatched
out of my hand by Sam, "Hey!", I protest and jump up to face
her.</p>

<p>Sam backs away towards the door and is pointing at my table, "You
better dry that up before the water ruins the table."</p>

<p>"Fuck the table. Give me my card", I'm in no joking mood.
Haven't been in a while.</p>

<p>Sam on the other hand is, "Come on Brooke, you gotta learn to
share", she stops in the doorway. I take a hesitant step in her
direction. She grins and takes a step backwards.</p>

<p>"Sam please", I whine with my most pathetic voice trying to
collect some pity points. She raises the card to take a better look
at it, "I'll do anything!", I suddenly scream making her
head jolt back up, "I'll do anything you want if you give me
the card back", I repeat with a normal tone.</p>

<p>Sam stares at me for a long time, "Will you let me take a look at
it?"</p>

<p>So like Sam, always bending the rules. She doesn't want to
alienate me any more by looking at it against my will, so she tries
to find a loophole, "No. It's private."</p>

<p>She was expecting the negative response, "Will you tell me why
it's so important then?"</p>

<p>"It's not", oh god, what have I done? Like she's gona
believe that one.</p>

<p>At first there's no change in her expression, then slowly she
starts to laugh. Yeah, it's very funny. She knows she's got
the upper hand now. The laughter stops pretty soon when she realizes
the situation isn't funny after all, "Yeah right. For days you
haven't shown any interest in anything, and now all of a sudden
you go ballistic over a postcard? And there's nothing special
about it?", I have no reply.</p>

<p>My eyes become irritated and I blink them a couple of times. Slowly I
remove them from Sam and let my gaze slide to her left. That's
better, my night table is a much more comfortable sight,
"It's a birthday card", I whisper. Too quietly for Sam to
hear.</p>

<p>She heard me mumbling though. Or saw my mouth moving,
"What?", she gives me plenty of time to answer. I don't,
"Look... okay, take the card. I'm sorry I teased you
Brooke", I hear her steps as she walks closer, but I keep my eyes
fixed on the table. Just in case Sam's playing some sort of a
trick, "Here. Take it."</p>

<p>Quickly I turn my head back to her. She's standing at an
arm's reach holding out the card. I'm still skeptic. She has
the advantage, why doesn't she use it? Why doesn't she break
my armor? Warily I reach for the card and take a hold of it,
"Di... did you...", why is my throat so dry all of a sudden?
It makes talking harder, "Look at it?"</p>

<p>She shrugs her shoulders, "No. I mean I saw the picture. Dorothy
and that dog from the movie", that's not so bad. As long as
she didn't look at the back, "It's pretty", I look at
the card. It is pretty, but that's got nothing to do with why I
love it. I usually don't even see the picture, just the memories,
"It's from your mother, right?"</p>

<p>It takes a few seconds for the words to sink in. She lied. She did
look at it  No, why would she lie and then confess to it right
after? "How'd you know?", I ask not looking up.</p>

<p>"I've got a brain, Brooke. There are precisely two things
that have gotten a reaction out of you. Your mother and that
card", I nod, "So I just put two and two together."</p>

<p>There's something different about Sam when I look at her again.
Usually her stare feels like it's penetrating right through my
skull, but not now. Now it's softer, kinder. And it's not
just the stare, it's everything about her. She's giving me
time and not pressing for the answers like usually. Like last night.
And it's working better too. I wanna tell her things. And I would
if not for this tiny voice in my head still screaming, `It's a
trap! She's got some hidden motive, she doesn't care about
you.' And even when my twisted little mind realizes how stupid
that sounds, a part of me believes it.</p>

<p>Finally I open my mouth, not fully knowing what's gona come out,
"I thought you were having trouble with math", uh oh... that
sounded like a joke.</p>

<p>Sam's face lights up like a candle. She sees this as some major
breakthrough. I've gotten her hopes up, and then when nothing
actually changes she'll be crushed. Again. In a way this
`Save the Brooke' project of hers is more important to her
than to me. By helping me she's helping herself deal with the
pain.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I am", she says after a while, "Could you help me
with it?"</p>

<p>"Sam", I say and sit down so I don't have to look at her
when I shatter her hopes, "I know you've kinda taken it upon
yourself to... I don't know... rescue me or something. But honest
to god, there's nothing you can do."</p>

<p>She's silent. And I don't dare to look up. Almost a minute
goes by without a word spoken. I know cause I watch the seconds tick
away in my clock on the table. Which is still wet by the way. I
don't know why Sam was so worried, it doesn't seem to absorb
any water. I grab a couple of tissues from the open drawer and start
to dry up the table. Sam's still not talking. Should I get
worried? A quick glance over my shoulder proves that she's still
standing there. There's nothing soft in her eyes anymore though.</p>

<p>She speaks when I turn my attention back to the table, "Lying in
god's name, Brooke? That's not good", she falters
slightly when she talks. I managed to really hurt her, "Not good.
I suppose you think your mother can help you?", her voice drips
of poison.</p>

<p>Done with my cleaning, I turn around again and look at Sam. Her eyes
have narrowed into tiny slits, and her mouth is a straight line,
"I don't expect you to understand it Sam."</p>

<p>"Try me", she says immediately. And I should try,
shouldn't I? Cause she deserves to know. And I feel bad everytime
I hurt her by not letting her help me.</p>

<p>I sigh and start to think of a way to explain it. It's hard cause
I don't know if I understand it myself even, "Do you remember
the first day we went back to school?", she nods. And I see the
hope float back into her, when she realizes I'm gona share some
of my secrets. Talk about mood swings. She's gona be a wreck when
the day's over. The day is over, it's almost eleven already,
"I saw the way your friends were consoling you. They were there
the minute you stepped into the school, and they cared. Your friends
love you Sam", she isn't following my train of thought.
Now's the time to stop, if I don't want her to know. But
I'm not gona stop, she wants hear it. Who knows, maybe it does
some good for her, "And I realized that with my dad gone, there
isn't a single soul in this world who truly loves me. And
everybody needs love, Sam. Because being without it hurts like hell.
For a while, and then when the hurt is gone, there isn't anything
left."</p>

<p>At first she just looks at me. Looks real hard, "Brooke
that's just...", she flings her hands in the air, spins
around and takes a couple of steps towards my bed, stops and turns
around to face me again, "And you look to your MOTHER for love?
She abandoned you!", yeah, thanks for pointing THAT out. Like I
wasn't painfully aware of it already, "Besides", she goes
on and takes a step forward, "You have people who love you.
There's Josh and..."</p>

<p>"If you say Nicole, I'm gona slap you silly", I cut her
in mid-sentence. Slowly she closes her mouth, "First of all, you
said you had a brain. So you should be able to separate Josh's
puppy-crush from the real thing. And secondly, I'd appreciate it
if you would just shut up about my mother. I know what she's
done."</p>

<p>She opens her mouth and I just know she's gona bash my mother
some more. But nothing comes out. At first. There's like ten
seconds before she speaks, "But you and Josh were together like
so long. Sure he had feelings for you?"</p>

<p>"Look, enough with Josh. The guy makes me sick", I say and
mean it. I've had enough of him for a lifetime. That's what I
told him in the cafeteria that first day we went back. Maybe not in
those very words.</p>

<p>It's like, all morning he just keeps pestering me, `Are you
okay Brooke? Do you nead anything? How do you feel?' And I tell
him over and over again that I'm fine. Just give me some room to
breathe. But no, he just doesn't get it. Finally at lunch
I've had enough.</p>

<p>`Do you want some more milk, Brooke?',<br>
`No.'<br>
`How about water?'<br>
`No.'<br>
`Any..'</p>

<p>That's when I jump up and yell, `Jesus Christ! Can't you
just leave me the fuck alone?', and storm out. He tries to patch
up things the next day, but I won't listen.</p>

<p>
"You know I wasn't gona say Nicole", once again Sam pulls
me back to reality. It's like the manyeth time during these past
days. It takes me a while to replay our previous conversation in my
head, and to pick the right spot, "You know, when I said you have
people who love you", she helps me when she sees I'm having
trouble grasping her meaning.</p>

<p>"Oh... okay", so what?</p>

<p>"I was gona say me", oh that's what. Sam's voice is a
little tense. Like she is forcing herself to say the things, "I
care about you Brooke."</p>

<p>"Yes, well", I answer her, "There's a difference
between care and love. Lots of people care about me. Like aunt
Jessica."</p>

<p>"Fine. I love you then", she blurts out just like that. Not
very convincing. And there's still that tension in the voice.
She's just telling me what she thinks I want to hear.</p>

<p>"Really sweet of you, Sam. But you can't just say it and make
it so."</p>

<p>"I really, really do love you Brooke. You have to know that",
I look at her skeptically and she notices it, "You think I enjoy
the time I spend here trying to get you to live again?", amazing
how easily we revert back to our old habits. This banter is just like
the one's we used to have before the accident, "Well, I
don't. I do it because I love you."</p>

<p>The conversation has probably gone on longer than all my other
one's from the past two days put together. And I'm growing
tired. And Sam won't end it. Cause she's making such
progress. So it's up to me, "Okay. Could you do it another
time maybe? I'd like to get some sleep."</p>

<p>"Just say you believe me. And I'll go."</p>

<p>But I don't believe you. You have this weird look in your eyes
everytime you say it. You are just lying to get your way, "I
believe you", just like I'm lying to get mine.</p>
