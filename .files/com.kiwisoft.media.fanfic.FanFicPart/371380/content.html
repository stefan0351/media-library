<p><b>Chapter 6</b></p>
<p><i>Christmas…</i></p>
<p>Her nose wrinkled since something cold passed over it again, and her mouth twitched with discomfort as she was dragged slowly out of her deep sleep. The rest of her body was warm, comfortably so, yet the warmth was not coming from the duvet on top of her, or from the depth of the mattress. She was warm because of another source that was beneath the covers with her.</p>
<p>Lilly opened her eyes and glanced around at the room which was similar, but certainly wasn't hers. She wasn't in her bed. This was a different space within the hotel and in that moment of realisation her eyes jerked open properly. Then she became aware of her face, and how the movements were stiffer because her muscles were chilled; someone had accidentally left a window open and the room was freezing.</p>
<p>Then Lilly turned her head to the side and the five seconds of confusion broke apart, allowing the reality of the previous night to come flooding back to her in the same way the extra warmth spread through the bed towards her.</p>
<p><i>Oh my god…</i> Lilly mouthed to herself, and she had to bite down on her lip to suppress a laugh, although the smile still shone through. It was too good to be true, and yet it had actually happened and she could remember every moment and every soft touch.</p>
<p>Miley's eyelashes fluttered and Lilly held her breath at once, not wanting to ruin the other girl's sleep. She didn't awaken, however, and Lilly released a sigh of relief, which brushed over Miley's sleeping expression and brought a ghost of a smile to her lips. She was beautiful, even in sleep. The state made her look more vulnerable and entirely serene. Lilly wanted to gather Miley up into her arms and hold her tightly, but she couldn't. She daren't wake the other girl, in case the spell would break and the path they wove together the night before would be undone.</p>
<p>It was difficult though, to be still and not to rouse the other girl by pressing her mouth, already hungry for further kisses, against Miley's pouted lips. Lilly had learned the shape and feeling of Miley's mouth in the space of that one evening. She knew how Miley liked to be kissed and she wet her lips in memory of the touch. Her heart was swelling up within her once more, it was impossible that she felt this way, so completely <i>attached </i>to this other girl when it was so early in their relationship. They weren't even declared a couple and yet, somehow, Lilly knew they were. Because she knew Miley – she had learnt her through the long hours they had spent together tracing the sides of the mountains.</p>
<p>Ever so carefully, Lilly reached across with a tentative hand to twine her fingers in some of Miley's loose curls, which were splayed across the pillows. She twisted the fine, dark hair gently and smiled whilst her eyes roamed over the sleeping girl's face. It was only shortly after dawn and Lilly had gained little sleep from the night, she had been too excited to succumb to such a trivial need when the want inside her being had become almost too much to resist.</p>
<p>Miley shifted within the bed until she was lying on her side and her lips parted further. Her mouth moved, forming words and her brow creased in the middle with something that looked like confusion, until it softened and she was still. "Mornin'." Miley mumbled and Lilly felt her throat tighten. After a few seconds, Miley lazily opened an eye and peered at Lilly. On seeing her new friend tucked up tightly beneath the covers, Miley's expression spread into a slow yet bright smile for such an early hour. "You're still here."</p>
<p>Lilly's lips curled into a smile then, "Yeah. I didn't want you to be lonely on Christmas morning, so I thought I'd stay and wake up with you."</p>
<p>Miley's smile became a tingle-inspiring grin, "I'm glad you did. I thought you'd have suddenly realised what you'd let yourself in for and snuck out."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, "I dunno. I just can't believe my luck; that I get to wake up next to you on Christmas day."</p>
<p>Lilly blushed, "I couldn't stay away." Her tone turned serious and she found her heart struggling to hold back in its beats, "Something's happening inside of me, and I really can't stay away from you."</p>
<p>She felt hot then, almost uncomfortably so, and yet her heart willed her on, it had made her say the words and Miley was still silent, her eyes flickering over Lilly's. Until Miley leaned forward and kissed her, so softly and slowly and passionately on her lips that Lilly thought she would melt right there.</p>
<p>Miley broke away carefully and somewhere under the covers her hand managed to find Lilly's and link their fingers together, "Then don't stay away from me. Just be with me and make my Christmas day perfect." Lilly smiled shyly and Miley crinkled her nose, "Your face is cold." She giggled then, "Jees, it's freezing in here." Miley pushed herself up on her pillows and shivered when the duvet slipped from her neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>"I think you left the window open last night."</p>
<p>Miley's smile turned mischievous, "That was the intention. I kinda fancied some snuggling." She pouted hopelessly at Lilly, who was already lost on the expression.</p>
<p>"Well, there was plenty of that."</p>
<p>"Hmm…" Miley sighed and eased herself back down and nearer to Lilly. "You are very huggable." She then slid one arm casually across Lilly's midsection and burrowed her head into Lilly's shoulder.</p>
<p>Lilly laughed, "And you're too cute to deny. Is this going to be a problem, for future reference?"</p>
<p>Miley shook her head from side to side and her cold nose tickled Lilly's skin, "Nope. As long as I get my way we'll be just fine." She then pressed a kiss against Lilly's throat and the blonde gave up and stroked Miley's hair.</p>
<p>"Have you ever done this before, Lilly?" Miley asked after a few comfortable moments had passed.</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Just, you know, lain with a girl before, like this?"</p>
<p>Lilly frowned slightly, "No, I can't say I have."</p>
<p>"Me neither." Miley replied and Lilly could hear the smile in her voice. "What about with a boy?"</p>
<p>"There was one boy." Lilly answered slowly and she was certain the smile had become frozen on Miley's face.</p>
<p>"Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. But that was a couple of years back, we were kids and our relationship wasn't serious. We would just cuddle sometimes."</p>
<p>Lilly felt the release of Miley's tensed muscles, although the movement was subtle. She ran her hand down Miley's back and the girl pressed herself nearer, causing Lilly's skin to ignite. "What are ya doin' today?" Miley asked through a yawn and Lilly's hand drifted deeper into her hair, playing with the curls.</p>
<p>"I'll probably go to my parents' room this morning and open my presents, and then I don't know really…We'll have breakfast I suppose and then maybe go skiing?"</p>
<p>"That sounds like my day plan too." Miley replied, "Do you and your family want to eat with us?"</p>
<p>"I would." Lilly grinned and pressed a kiss against the top of Miley's head, "And I'm sure my parents won't say no."</p>
<p>"Hmm." Miley sighed and her body released another yawn. Lilly could sense the other girl was falling back asleep and she felt it too. Her body was becoming heavier and her eyes were sliding shut.</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>When Lilly next opened her eyes she discovered that the room had grown lighter, despite the curtains being pulled tightly shut. It was properly morning now and the sun glancing off the pure snow on the landscape outside the windows had caused a white glow to burn quietly beyond their dark room.</p>
<p>Lilly sighed, turning to cast her eyes over Miley's sleeping expression and then the digital clock-face on the other side of Miley's bed, telling her that her mother would be rapping on her door in t-minus ten minutes. Lilly rolled her eyes and heaved herself upwards into a sitting position with some difficulty for Miley's sheets were warm.</p>
<p>"Mmm… Where are you going?" Miley muttered, and her voice was thick with sleep.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled and ran her hand over Miley's cheek, brushing her wild hair away from her lips. "I better go before my mum comes bursting into my room and wonders where I am."</p>
<p>"Don't go." Miley blearily opened an eye and her lips curled away to reveal a toothy smile.</p>
<p>Lilly's lips twitched into a grin of her own, "I have to. But I'll see you at breakfast." Miley tried to sit up beside her and Lilly giggled to see the inelegance of her attempt. She leaned down and graced Miley's lips with a soft kiss, which quickly turned deeper and the longing within Lilly's chest grew. She drew away, "I really have to go."</p>
<p>"Not yet." Miley murmured and her hand slid across Lilly's cheek, around to the base of her neck where she held them together and kissed Lilly with a slow passion that burned from the press of their lips down into the rapid beating of her frantic heart.</p>
<p>"Miley…" Lilly whispered against the quiet urgency in which Miley was kissing her. "… I'm still going to be yours in an hour. Nothing will change if I leave you for a few long minutes."</p>
<p>"Mine?" Miley asked in a low voice, her smile coy yet knowing. "All mine?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Lilly blushed. Miley's fingertips were splayed out and drifting across her neck, exciting her skin and depleting Lilly's resistance. Yet Lilly had to be strong, "I really need to get back to my room, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley nodded and eased away, her cobalt eyes holding onto Lilly's, "I'll see you in one hour."</p>
<p>Lilly jerked her head in agreement; her body seized up as she internally did battle with her desire to cover Miley's being with her own and drown her in long kisses and slow touches. Lilly blinked and seized the moment to deliver a swift and unassuming kiss upon Miley's lips. "I'll see you soon." Lilly promised and swung her legs around and out of the bed.</p>
<p>The room was still cold and Lilly shivered as she stumbled to find her shoes in the grey light. She hastened to pull her rumpled shirt down and smooth out the creases with hands that were itching to become acquainted with Miley rather than obey their true mistress. Lilly could smell her shirt when she bent to tug her shoes clumsily onto her feet; she was coated with the fragrance of Miley's bed and Lilly almost whimpered at the unfairness of having to leave the sleepy beauty.</p>
<p>Allowing herself one last meaningful gaze at Miley, who held onto her with a powerful yearning which spilled from her eyes, Lilly managed to bow gracefully out before scurrying guiltily back to her own room. She put her trust in the stairwell again, not having faith in the elevator which was surrounded by young families. Her cheeks bore a permanent pink stain; although she knew that nothing had happened that night beyond sweet kisses and tentative touches, she was very much aware that she was still in the clothes of the day before and had stayed in a different room under not quite innocent circumstances. She was fortunate enough not to bump into anyone she knew, particularly her cruel brother, and her hands were barely shaking as she managed to unlock her bedroom door and slip inside.</p>
<p>Lilly stripped out of clothes quickly, leaving them in a colourful array all over her hotel room floor, and rapidly pulled a dressing-gown across her bare skin when she heard a tap on the door. "Good morning mum." Lilly chirped brightly, yet she was still very much aware of the burn across her cheeks and her awkward smile.</p>
<p>Heather Trucott's eyes twinkled vibrantly as she took in her daughter that morning. She understood Lilly better than the young woman was aware and she could read the brightness in her daughter's eyes. Heather knew the pure happiness which seemed to radiate from Lilly had nothing to do with Christmas cheer.</p>
<p>"Happy Christmas, Lilly." Heather said and stepped forward to draw her child into a warm embrace.</p>
<p>"Happy Christmas, mum." Lilly replied and she hugged her mother back tightly, revelling in the arms she had known her entire life.</p>
<p>Heather inhaled deeply, at once breathing in a smell that was alien to the natural scent which came from her daughter's skin. She did not know the fragrance; it was thick although it was already beginning to fade, and it was also decidedly feminine. That was one good thing though, and Heather's worries dispersed at once.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to come and open your presents, darling?"</p>
<p>Lilly glanced back into her room, "I was just about to have a shower, but can I meet you in your room in, like, fifteen minutes?"</p>
<p>Heather smiled, "Of course. You have a nice, warm shower and your father and I will see you presently."</p>
<p>Lilly did not fail to notice the knowing glint in her mother's eyes and she smiled shyly when Heather's hand stroked her daughter's cheek, a silent message which conveyed that everything was alright. "I love you mum." Lilly said then, suddenly, and she smiled brightly at her own surprise.</p>
<p>Heather beamed back and hugged Lilly again, "I love you too, sweetie. Happy Christmas."</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>Wearing a flimsy hat atop her head Lilly grinned whilst her father only shrugged weakly since they were all being forced into paper crowns from the Christmas crackers at their place-settings on the breakfast table.</p>
<p>"Matthew, you <i>will</i> wear it, it's tradition!" Heather Truscott insisted as she leaned across her son's squirming frame and placed the paper hat in its rightful position.</p>
<p>Sarah giggled when her eyes landed on the mortified expression of her fiancé and Lilly's chuckle was also remorseless. She had given in to her mother quickly, knowing only too well the woman's stubborn nature, which she shared with the son who had only been wheedled into it through persistence and threats of disappointment in the breaking of tradition.</p>
<p>"Oh Matthew, don't you look handsome." Lilly crooned and her brother glared at her.</p>
<p>Heather laughed, but she paused on her way back to her seat and rested her hand on Lilly's shoulder, "Oh, Lilly, isn't that Miley?"</p>
<p>Lilly's head jerked around so quickly she almost gave herself whiplash. Massaging her sore neck, Lilly swiftly blushed when Miley met her eyes and she remembered the funny hat on her head. When she reached up absently to remove it, however, her brother's stern reproach made her think otherwise and she silently cursed herself for not fighting her mother's wishes, just this once.</p>
<p>Miley was smiling brightly though and she tugged on her father's arm to get him to stop, indicating for them to sit with the Truscott family, of which Robbie Ray seemed only too happy to do. Heather was there at once, striding forward with the air of the most gracious hostess, although breakfast in the hotel dining room was not her place to host.</p>
<p>She welcomed Robbie Ray warmly, kissing him on each cheek before shaking Jackson's hand and finally turning to Miley. "Happy Christmas." Heather said fondly and to Lilly's embarrassment she embraced her new girlfriend as if she had known the girl for many years, and not just a few days.</p>
<p>Heather inhaled deeply as she hugged the young woman, who shyly returned the affection of the jovial mother and, when she drew away, all of the pieces of Heather's puzzle fell miraculously into place. She had no need to ponder now over the lingering smile shared between the two girls, and the way Lilly hopped onto her feet and politely pulled out a chair for Miley. Heather only contented herself to ensuring that Robbie Ray and Jackson were equally as comfortable around the table before she could sit down and begin her own breakfast.</p>
<p>"Your mum is really nice." Miley whispered to Lilly when she reached across her to take a croissant from the pile in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>"Is she?" Lilly asked quietly, though she was smiling.</p>
<p>"Yes." Miley replied sternly and Lilly laughed at her tone.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she's okay." Lilly met her mother's eyes and Heather winked before returning to her conversation with her new friend Robbie Ray.</p>
<p>Miley was smiling whilst she applied strawberry jam to her croissant and Lilly could not help the longing comparisons she was making between Miley's pouting lips and the colour of the sweet confit. As her friend delicately took a bite of her breakfast Lilly had to drag her eyes away from the lips which had temporarily become coated in the fruit sugar. She yearned to kiss the sticky jam from Miley's lips herself, but that just wasn't breakfast table etiquette so she sat still and complacent, dipping her croissant in chocolate spread and trying to eat without making a mess.</p>
<p>"It's like the first morning of the holiday." Miley sighed as she wiped the crumbs from her fingers onto her napkin. When Lilly looked confused Miley grinned at her, "You, stuffing your face with croissants."</p>
<p>Lilly almost choked on her mouthful, "What?"</p>
<p>"Well, you almost ran me over in your hurry to get to the croissant mountain." Miley replied with a simple shrug.</p>
<p>"Hey, that's not fair. You were totally in <i>my</i> way." Lilly argued playfully back and Miley only smiled.</p>
<p>"Well maybe I was hoping you'd bump into me."</p>
<p>Lilly blushed and the colour spread further across her cheeks when Miley's hand suddenly found hers beneath the table. She twisted their fingers together and Lilly gazed ardently into Miley's eyes which were such a deep and changing blue that morning that Lilly didn't quite know how to stop staring. Nothing had changed in one hour except, perhaps now, Lilly desired Miley more. The blonde smiled giddily at the thought and pressed her palm tightly against Miley's, destroying the slight spaces between their hands. She felt feverish – alive with a burning heat of adoration for the brunette beside her; the snow would melt beneath her wake today and the mountains would bend under each of her footsteps. Lilly had to inhale deeply and take a sip of cold orange juice; she had never known such an intense craving to be with another young woman before now.</p>
<p>"Lilly?" Heather's voice was attempting to break through the cloud of Lilly's daydreams and, with some difficulty, Lilly managed to focus on her mother and smile weakly in encouragement for the woman to continue. "We're going to spend the morning skiing as a family but after lunch you and Miley can go off and have some free time until the evening when we're all going to have dinner together. Does that sound alright with you?"</p>
<p><i>No,</i> was Lilly's instant thought, yet she knew the value of being a good daughter and managed to smile through her annoyance at being separated from Miley. "Yeah, that's fine with me."</p>
<p>She turned to share a glance with Miley, who for one second allowed Lilly to see a glimpse of her own disappointment, until the brunette covered it up with a more convincing sunny exterior, "Sounds like a plan Mrs Truscott." Miley replied with a bright grin. "Though, I am going to miss my skiing buddy." Miley nudged Lilly gently in the ribs and Lilly felt the surge of heat flowing through her increase.</p>
<p>"Hmm… On the other hand it might be nice to get away from the girl who promises a train wreck every time she straps herself into a pair of skis." Lilly mused and earned a playful punch to the shoulder from Miley.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Lilly grinned, her sky-like eyes sparkling as they flickered over Miley's face, taking in her pouting expression and at the amusement playing in her own oceanic irises. "You'll be sorry when we meet up later and I'm ten times the better skier than you." Miley insisted in a childish tone and Lilly laughed openly.</p>
<p>"Bring it on!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's already been <i>brung</i>."</p>
<p>"Erm Miley, that's not even a word."</p>
<p>Miley frowned, pondering through her internal dictionary, and then she smiled sheepishly, "Damn it."</p>
<p>"I don't mean to be the one to break up this little love-fest," Lilly's older brother was making his voice heard as he rose from his seat, "but my feet are itching to get on the slopes and kick Lilly's…" Heather was watching closely, "…bottom… at skiing this morning."</p>
<p>Lilly revelled in the challenge and was on her own feet a second later, "We'll see about that." She turned to wink at Miley, "He's got nothing on me."</p>
<p>"As long as the next time I see you won't be in a stretcher, being towed along behind the ski-medics." Miley grimaced and Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"I'll be careful." She rested her hand on Miley's shoulder and automatically bent down to kiss her, until she stiffened and realised the eyes of her family were all upon her. Lilly cleared her throat, "Erm, I'll see you later then." She murmured somewhat awkwardly, "Do you want to meet up around three? I actually have something for you." Lilly said quietly as the rest of the breakfasters were finishing up around them.</p>
<p>"Sounds great." Miley answered with a warm smile. "It's a date." She finished and laughed softly.</p>
<p>"Yes, a date." Lilly replied and she couldn't prevent the sweet grin from spreading across her face.</p>
<p>"I'll meet you at your room, at three then?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and gave Miley the number hastily before her brother started tugging her out of the dining room. She was allowed only one more fleeting glance at the girl who was beginning to weave her way into Lilly's every thought, and then she was stumbling along with her brother who was smiling wickedly.</p>
<p>"What?" Lilly asked of Matt with some exasperation and he chuckled until she stopped in her tracks and he came to a halt beside her. "Seriously, what?" Lilly asked, her voice rising slightly as she squared up before him, the younger sister gazing deeply into the blue eyes of her older brother who was watching her with an unreadable expression.</p>
<p>Then his poker-face shattered and a true smile of affection flooded his handsome features, "You've bagged yourself a good one this time, sis." Lilly blushed and suddenly her shoes were more interesting than anything else. Matt laughed again, drawing Lilly towards him only to wrap her head beneath his arm and tangle her golden hair with his other hand.</p>
<p>"Hey! Not… the noogie…" Lilly panted and he released her, his own cheeks flushed pink with mirth.</p>
<p>"Oh Lilly…" Matt sighed and he ruffled her hair again. His good humour was contagious though, and Lilly couldn't help smiling even though her brother was probably the single most irritating person she had ever known. "Seriously, congratulations on finding yourself a little hottie. Miley is probably the best catch you will ever make."</p>
<p>Lilly scowled, "Whatever." Then her expression broke, "She is though, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Matt shrugged, "As long as all of the pieces fit. All I'm saying is that you two are good together – I can already see that. You two girls are <i>so </i>goofy."</p>
<p>"Oi!" Lilly grumbled, but Matt was already a few strides ahead of her, getting a running start before her fists could start flying.</p>
<p>"Lilly's in love!" Matt cried mercilessly and his laughter rang through the hallway, startling other hotel guests as he passed them. Lilly's cheeks burned when their curious expressions landed on her, and from the intuition of her family who had already worked out every inch of her feelings for the other girl, within her secret heart.</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>Lilly brushed the ice-flakes from her chin and quickly ran her hands over the scarf around her neck to prevent the snow from melting into the material and making her cold later. Her lost ski was only a couple of feet away and already being brought back to her by her amused father.</p>
<p>"I wiped out again." Lilly said and her father smiled with her.</p>
<p>"Your concentration is somewhere else this morning, Lilly." Michael Truscott reflected with a wry smile and Lilly could only mirror the expression somewhat sheepishly.</p>
<p>"She's too busy thinking about her girlfriend." Matt chided from the side and Lilly was quick to bend, scoop up a tight ball of the white stuff and hurl it directly into his face. For once Matt didn't see it coming and it was finally his turn to choke on snow.</p>
<p>"Don't pay any attention to him, sweetheart." Michael said gently as he watched his incredulous son glare haughtily at his younger sister. "When he first started dating Sarah he was an emotional wreck and he would do well to remember that." Michael had increased the volume of his voice and Matt skied away hastily.</p>
<p>"Thanks dad." Lilly sighed softly and her father wrapped one arm awkwardly around her shoulders, still holding his ski poles in his free hand. He didn't need to say anything, which was a relief to Lilly and instead she enjoyed the peaceful moment with him in the freezing air of the winter wonderland spread out around them. "It's so beautiful up here." Lilly said after a few long seconds of peace, "I'm so glad you brought us skiing for Christmas."</p>
<p>"Well, Malibu hardly promises a festive season full of snow, does it?"</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, "But this was an amazing gift for us, dad, and I just want you to know that I really appreciate it."</p>
<p>"I thought you might." Michael replied quietly, "Your mum and I had some amazing ski holidays when we were younger. It really is a very romantic setting."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Lilly's tongue twisted in her mouth as her cheeks turned pinker than the frozen landscape had managed to make them so far.</p>
<p>Michael only chuckled ruefully and squeezed Lilly closer to him before releasing and digging his poles into the white tundra beneath their skis. "Are you ready to move on?"</p>
<p>"And meet mum at the bottom? Let's go." Lilly leaned forward, eager again for the thrill of the speed she had reached without a lesson full of less able skiers slowing her down or clogging up the slopes before her.</p>
<p>"Race you." Michael said, the competitive side he shared with Lilly at once coming out and he copied her stance, edging himself forward.</p>
<p>"See ya!" Lilly squeaked as she launched herself forwards with a bright laugh. She could hear her father's cry of dismay at her head-start and she curled into a more aero-dynamic position, her poles tucked up under her elbows and her bright eyes focused on the white landscape before her. Lilly could barely remember a time before this Christmas morning when she had felt more alive.</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>Lilly sat Indian-style on her bed, nervously running her fingertips over the wrapped package resting in the space she had made between her legs. She checked the digital bedside clock again, the time reading two minutes until three and she chewed her lip, inhaling deeply to keep her pulse from lifting her off the bed.</p>
<p>She was wearing her most comfortable hooded jumper and her ski pants from earlier which were now dry. Even though she was bathed in warmth, Lilly couldn't help the shiver of anxiety or the flushes of heat as her body attempted to gain control over her adrenaline-filled blood. Her breathing was irregular and her heartbeat was equally so; it was as if her intelligent mind could not get a grasp on the most basic of her internal controls.</p>
<p>A gentle knock on the door brought Lilly out of her reverie and she felt her armpits prickle with the threat of a nervous sweat. She shook her head, attempting to shake herself out of her increased state of longing agitation and made her way to the door. Lilly ran her hands through her loose hair, ruffling it up in an effort to make herself appear casual and like she hadn't just been waiting for the other girl to walk back into her life since the first minute she had left her behind at breakfast that morning.</p>
<p>"Hey." Lilly sighed when her eyes landed on Miley Stewart who was already in her ski clothes, with her jacket bunched up in her arms.</p>
<p>"Hi." Miley replied, her great blue eyes already sparkling and drawing Lilly to her. "Can I come in?" Miley asked, giggling slightly as she continued to watch Lilly who was standing in an apparent daydream.</p>
<p>"Sure." Lilly smiled sheepishly and stepped aside so that Miley could enter her room.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't quite know what to do with herself, so she hovered awkwardly behind Miley, her hands clenching and unclenching at her sides whilst she fought against her will to throw herself on the other girl and drown her in kisses. That, however, seemed to be Miley's own intention on visiting Lilly in her hotel room when she turned, her eyes piercing Lilly with her own desire and, with her hands grasping Lilly's sweater, she drew the blonde flush against her body, kissing her deeply.</p>
<p>"Mmm… I missed you today…" Miley murmured quietly in the small passage they had allowed between their lips during a moment's pause.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled and pressed her lips ardently against Miley's once more, "Missed you more." When Lilly broke the kiss, she tugged Miley's lower lip away with her, and then released her. "You have the most delicious lips." Lilly ventured softly and Miley smiled.</p>
<p>"Aren't you adorable?" Miley whispered, her hand rising to stroke Lilly's cheek as she smiled into the blonde's eyes.</p>
<p>Lilly had never felt so saturated in feeling before. Her heart was leaping in her chest; each beat a joyful event at keeping her alive so that she could remain closer to Miley. Lilly shook her head incredulously because she knew where these emotions were leading, but she didn't want to say it aloud just yet for fear of jinxing their holiday romance.</p>
<p>"I have something for you." Lilly ventured and managed to pull herself away from Miley to retrieve the object from where she had left it on her bed. She passed it to Miley carefully, "It's just a little something so that you'll always remember our holiday together."</p>
<p>Miley smiled shyly, "I haven't got you anything."</p>
<p>Lilly blushed, feeling embarrassed even before she could reassure Miley, "Just being able to kiss you and hold you in ways other girls aren't allowed is enough for me."</p>
<p>Miley quirked an eyebrow, "Who says they're not?" Then Miley laughed, "No, there's only you."</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes though the smile remained on her lips. The close emotions of what they were each saying was getting to her and she needed to dilute them before she said something she might regret, "Just open your present, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley smiled; her eyes watchful of Lilly for a few moments, as if she was trying to discern the contents of the parcel from the depths of Lilly's eyes. Lilly blinked and Miley's intense stare was gone whilst she concentrated on unwrapping her gift, very slowly so as not to ruin the paper.</p>
<p>Eventually the paper was allowed to drift to the floor when Miley stood holding the glass orb, resting on a small stand, in her hands. Her eyes were filled with a quiet joy that only grew with the smile that curved across her face. "A snow globe." Miley breathed, "Oh Lilly, it's beautiful."</p>
<p>Miley carefully turned the globe upside-down, before righting it again and then repeating the action a couple more times. Finally she stopped and held her present up between them and they silently watched the miniature flakes of snow swirl, before settling on the tiny mountain village encased within the glass.</p>
<p>"I love it." Miley whispered, "Thank you so much, Lilly."</p>
<p>"You're welcome." Lilly replied, temporarily at a loss for words and she was relieved when Miley wrapped her arm around her waist, tugging her close for another sweet kiss. "I'm so glad you like it."</p>
<p>Miley's fingers had returned to tracing the curves of Lilly's face, "I like it even more because it's from you."</p>
<p>"Miley…" Lilly murmured and looked away shyly.</p>
<p>Her girlfriend laughed softly, "It's the truth. Gosh, Lilly…"</p>
<p>Lilly met her eyes again and saw the pink stain on Miley's cheeks, her eyes glittering with the same affection that was currently burning through herself. Miley looked as if she wanted to say something further but Lilly only kissed her quickly and encouraged her to place her present back on the nightstand.</p>
<p>"Come on; let's hit the slopes before it gets dark."</p>
<p>Miley nodded and waited for Lilly to gather up the rest of her skiing belongings before they made the journey to the changing rooms, where the smell of old socks still hung in the air. "Mmm… I don't think this aroma will ever grow old." Miley cracked, her voice heavy with sarcasm.</p>
<p>Lilly chuckled, "It kinda reminds me of a male fragrance my brother once requested for Christmas when he was a teenager. Mum had to spray a room with practically a can of aerosol every time he passed through."</p>
<p>"I wish my brother would grow out of the stinky phase." Miley sighed, "Unfortunately I don't think he ever will." Lilly grinned and pulled her chunky ski boots onto her feet, "Do you want me to do those up for you?"</p>
<p>Miley dropped to her knees in front of Lilly and turned her deft fingers to the buckles of Lilly's boots. Lilly watched the brunette curls fall across her face whilst she bent lower to ease the straps nearest Lilly's toes into place. She reached out and ran her fingers through Miley's hair, gently massaging the top of her head and she shuddered at Miley's quite moan of approval.</p>
<p>"You're really good at that." Miley murmured and her eyes returned to meet Lilly's.</p>
<p>Then her hands were away from Lilly's feet and resting on her knees instead, sliding up Lilly's thighs whilst Miley leaned nearer. Her eyes were glazed with longing and Lilly forgot the unpleasant smell of the locker room, because she was only aware of the other girl and her warm hands creeping closer…</p>
<p>A burst of noise jolted Lilly back to her senses and her eyes swerved away from Miley, zeroing in on the father with his two rambunctious twin toddlers who had chosen the wrong timing to intrude. He smiled apologetically at the girls and their moment was gone. Miley was grinning mischievously and Lilly couldn't help the smirk which slid across her face; Miley wanted her and that was enough.</p>
<p>"Let's get outta here." Miley said quietly, whilst rising to her feet and she extended her hand to help Lilly off the bench.</p>
<p>"Good idea." Lilly agreed as she watched the children running in circles around the poor man who was trying to get two pairs of hands into two sets of gloves, and failing.</p>
<p>Miley led the way out and soon their feet were making tracks in the settled snow across the forecourt of the hotel. Miley stopped to pull her hat over her head, juggling her skiing equipment inelegantly in her free arm and turned to smile at Lilly, "I think it's getting colder."</p>
<p>"That's okay, I'll keep you warm." Lilly replied enthusiastically and Miley almost dropped her poles.</p>
<p>"I was hoping you'd say somethin' like that." Miley drawled. "Come on, we're going this way." Lilly was happy enough to follow the brunette who was directing them both to another lift, one which she hadn't ridden very often to the top of the slopes.</p>
<p>There was barely anyone else around; families seeking comfort in the warmth of their rooms, or napping before the big Christmas feast promised by the hotel that evening. The Stewart and Truscott families had reserved their table and Lilly was already looking forward to sharing their Christmas meal with the girl who was finally beginning to satisfy all of her hungers.</p>
<p>They stepped into the lift together, a small cubicle suspended on a wire, and with a slight bump they were lifted up, higher into the mountains. Miley was at Lilly's side instantly, taking her hands into her own and running her thumbs over the back of Lilly's gloved palms. Then Miley paused in her ministrations and removed the layers which prevented her from touching Lilly's skin. She brought Lilly's left hand to her lips and pressed a kiss against her knuckles, followed by her palm.</p>
<p>"Your hands are so soft." Miley said and her voice was filled with a hushed wonder. "You know Lilly; you really are the most beautiful girl."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what to say. Miley's quiet awe of her was, in Lilly's own opinion, entirely undeserved. Lilly had been falling over herself all holiday just to be near the captivating young woman, who was currently moving her lips to rest against Lilly's wrist and the pulse which fluttered there.</p>
<p>"Your heart is beating really fast." Miley said and there was concern in her oceanic eyes.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, "I've been close to a heart attack all holiday. It's you – you're the one doing this to me."</p>
<p>Miley's eyes widened, "Perhaps I ought to stay away from you?"</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head slowly, not breaking their connection, "Don't. You have no idea how miserable that would make me."</p>
<p>"I think I do." Miley replied, her voice low, "Because every minute without you, my blood runs a degree colder."</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed, "Oh."</p>
<p>"Lilly, I think I'm…"</p>
<p>The lift stopped. "We're here." Lilly gasped and turned away to gather her skis before allowing Miley to exit the cubicle first.</p>
<p>Miley led the way up the small path to where the café was at the top of the slope and together they stood and looked over the map which showed the different routes they could take to the bottom. "How about this one?" Miley pointed to a small course and her finger trailed over the wiggly line which showed a way through copses of trees. "It's kinda off-piste. Dad and Jackson did it and all I heard was complaining afterwards because it was so tame."</p>
<p>"An easy slope is a good idea." Lilly agreed. "Let's go."</p>
<p>They both clicked their feet into their individual pairs of skis and followed the imprinted arrow on the sign which showed the way to the start of the course. Both girls manoeuvred neatly with more expertise than they had shown at the beginning of their adventures in the Alps. The route was simple enough and Lilly felt her confidence grow when she managed to parallel brake on a flatter part of the course whilst she waited for Miley to catch up.</p>
<p>"Impressive." Miley said and almost toppled over when she attempted to mimic Lilly's technique.</p>
<p>"Easy cowgirl." Lilly squeaked as she caught Miley by the elbow to prevent her from hitting the snow.</p>
<p>"Thanks honey."</p>
<p>Lilly blushed, "You're welcome."</p>
<p>To her joy Miley leaned in and kissed her softly. Miley's lips were wonderfully warm and Lilly smiled at the sensation of her friend's cold nose bumping against her own. "I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself." Miley sighed as she pulled away.</p>
<p>"You don't need to apologise for kissing me." Lilly replied and, to demonstrate her point, her mouth found Miley's once more. "See? I'm not sorry for just having done that."</p>
<p>"Me either." Miley grinned. "Come on." She inclined her head and Lilly followed Miley's gaze to the tree-lined road of snow, which was stretched out ahead of them and waiting for the passing of their skis.</p>
<p>The sky above them was becoming darker and just as they turned the next corner all of the light was there before them in the setting of the winter sun. Glancing upwards Lilly could see the pale streaks of clouds changing in colour with the dying of the day. Their ruffled edges were tinted with pink and, as she followed the direction of the rays towards their source her amazement at the sight before them could only grow.</p>
<p>"Gorgeous." Miley whispered and Lilly heard her lower her ski poles to the snow so that she could take Lilly's hand in her own.</p>
<p>The ground was level here and, with a shared look, both girls bent to release themselves from their skis. Together they padded forward, their boots making deeper dents in the snow than before, their footprints mixing as one as their sides brushed together whilst they walked. They stopped at the ridge and two pairs of blue eyes turned to sweep the view of the valley into which the sun was sinking.</p>
<p>"I don't think I've ever seen anything as gorgeous as that." Miley breathed and when she turned to face Lilly again her eyes were alive with such vivid beauty that Lilly couldn't help herself.</p>
<p>"I have – it's you, Miley. You are <i>so</i> beautiful."</p>
<p>Miley swallowed and she suddenly looked perplexed, yet brave at the same time and she swallowed before opening her mouth to speak, "Lilly, I think I'm…"</p>
<p>Lilly's fingers flying to still her shaking lips brought Miley to silence and Lilly felt incredibly guilty for the young woman who stood before her, eyes brimming with the adoration that Lilly also felt.</p>
<p>Then Lilly smiled, "I know." Her lips found Miley's through the cold, winter air and their mouths moved together in a dance of slow passion. "Is it wrong to say it so early? Is it too much?" Lilly whispered, her breath in small clouds of mist which rose up between them, but Miley's eyes would not be torn away.</p>
<p>"Like I said before Lilly, it could never be too much." Miley's eyes sparkled, "I'm falling in love with you."</p>
<p>Lilly's smile broke at the same time the sun's light flickered behind the peak of a mountain and then flared into full, golden light once more. "I love you too."</p>
<p>They stood then, in that wonderful space of the in between; after the sun had fallen, yet before it had set. Somewhere amidst the near start of the New Year in the dying of Christmas day. The sky was alive with the flames of their quiet love, which had come falling as lightly as the newborn snow – après ski.</p>
