<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;"><b>The Banana Conundrum</b><br>
by Satan's Camaro</p>
<p>Miley Stewart was livid. The entirety of her face was fire truck red not only out of anger, but also embarrassment in the wake of humiliation that seemed to follow her around like a lost puppy. Making a fool out of herself seemed to be a certainty lately, and today was no exception. Even thinking about it made Miley flustered and false swears – such as 'sweet flabbit' and 'dang nibblets' – flew loudly from her mouth as she crossed the living room to get to the kitchen, pausing only to dump her backpack on the couch next to her startled father. Robby Ray watched silently as Miley threw open the fridge and began raiding it, searching for something with unseeing eyes.</p>
<p>"Darlin', are you all right?" Robby Ray asked and stood from the couch, beginning to cautiously approach his daughter.</p>
<p>Miley paused and pulled her head from the fridge to utter a simple "Yes," and then began to fill the counter beside the open fridge door with ingredients for a sandwich.</p>
<p>"Then would you mind telling me why you're home before lunch?" Robby Ray asked with his eyebrows lifted in question. His voice was soft but firm as he observed her jerky movements with a wary eye.</p>
<p>"I just am." Miley retorted, but at the stern look Robby Ray gave her, she continued. "Fine. Something… happened today, and I didn't feel up to staying. Okay?"</p>
<p>Robby Ray stared at her, but Miley didn't face him. Instead, she was fixed on making herself a sandwich and though she was looking down, he could see her red face and the moisture welling in her eyes. "What happened, darlin'?" he wondered softly. Miley threw everything back in the fridge and sat down at the table, biting her sandwich with unnecessary force. After chewing and swallowing her food, she took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I might have accidentally come out to Lilly today."</p>
<p>Robby Ray had no idea what to say. In fact, he had no idea that she was inside of anything. "Come out of where?"</p>
<p>"The closet, Daddy! I came out of the damn closet. I like girls," she exclaimed, nearly hysterical.</p>
<p>"Oh." Robby Ray took a moment to digest this information, choosing not to think too deeply about it, knowing his daughter would overreact if he took a moment too long to acknowledge it. "So what happened?"</p>
<p>Miley looked pensive for a moment, then lifted her eyes and met his steadily. "What happened, Daddy, is what I like to refer to as… <i>The Banana Conundrum</i>."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">—</p>
<p>Miley did not approve.</p>
<p>Health class had always been one of her favorite classes, seeing as how she loved learning about the human body and how it worked, but that ceased to be true the moment she and her best friend Lilly Truscott stumbled through the doorway of the classroom in a fit of laughter. Within the first few seconds after stepping into the room, both she and Lilly laid eyes on two long, bright yellow bananas sitting on the table they shared together. Mr. Johnson, their new health teacher that looked to be fresh out of high school, stood at the front of the classroom giving instructions to practice the proper technique of putting on a condom the bananas. Miley sobered up immediately as a handful of condoms were placed into her waiting hand by the young teacher.</p>
<p>"There are more on the table, girls."</p>
<p><i>That's fantastic,</i> Miley thought as she moved to follow reaching her table, Miley set the packages down and reached out with wide eyes and trembling fingers. She plucked a small square from where it was nearly hidden beneath the bananas. Miley sat down and looked at Lilly nervously. Between her index and forefinger she held a thin foil package that did nothing but tease her with its golden wrapped displaying the head of a Trojan soldier. Mr. Johnson was still at the front, ripping open a packet carefully – <i>don't tear the condoms!</i> – and Miley couldn't help but swallow the large lump forming in her throat.</p>
<p>"Can you believe this?" Miley leaned over to whisper to Lilly, "Did you know he was going to do this today?"</p>
<p>"Oliver might have tipped me off last night," Lilly quipped, a sly smile on her face. "Apparently he did this last year."</p>
<p>While Miley was determining whether or not she should fight the mortification creeping up on her as she attempted – and failed – to do as instructed, Lilly was sitting next to her in a fit of giggles. Miley wanted to bang her head on the table. Why was Lilly giggling at a time like this?</p>
<p>Lilly obviously had no ill-feelings toward what was taking place so shortly after lunch but if she felt like Miley did – like her lunch would soon be making a miraculous reappearance – she didn't show it. Truth be told, Miley had no idea why these bananas were making her so uneasy. It wasn't as if she had never seen one – in fact, she ate them regularly. Perhaps it was the disapproving look she was receiving from Mr. Johnson as she fumbled with the small foil package that was her true source of her lack of comfort. Or maybe it was because she didn't see herself ever using a condom with any guy at Seaview High or life beyond high school.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Miley should have seen this coming. Not once in the four years of being a student at Seaview High was she ever required to do this particular assignment. More than one show on television displayed teenagers much like her doing the same thing she was attempting to do – with much less difficulty, of course.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you?" Miley intoned, her voice low as she tried to shake off her feeling of discomfort.</p>
<p>Lilly paused in her giggling to answer with a quick, "You're doing it wrong."</p>
<p>Miley lifted an eyebrow and lowered her eyes to the banana Lilly held in her hands. She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at the offending piece of food lying there looking all innocent… Miley scoffed. Yeah, right. Innocent her <i>ass</i>. "When am I even going to use one of these?" Miley murmured as she twirled the small golden package between her fingers.</p>
<p>Lilly let out a soft chuckle. "C'mon, Miles, I'll help you." She took a package from the table and thrust it toward Miley. "First, you open it."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain Duh," Miley felt her face flush as she did so. "Okay. Now what?"</p>
<p>"Now you unroll it about half an inch to see which direction it is unrolling to make sure it is right side out. Then put it on. It should unroll easily down the banana." Lilly explained smartly. "It's kind of like putting on a sock, you know?"</p>
<p>God, she did not just say that. A <i>sock</i>? Feeling unease creeping up on her once more, Miley wiggled her toes and cringed at the feel of her socks against her feet. Lilly took another wrapper from the table and thrust it toward Miley. "Just make sure you hold the top half-inch of the condom between your fingers to keep out air bubbles, which can cause it to break."</p>
<p>Miley did as Lilly instructed and let out a slow breath to calm her wildly beating heart. Releasing the banana, Miley bent her elbows on the table and rested her head in her hands. "When am I ever going to use one of these?" she murmured tiredly. "How do you know about all of this, anyway?</p>
<p>"My mom might have educated me earlier than most. Besides, it's not like you don't know what a condom is for." She paused and allowed Miley to let out a strangled sound. "You can't tell me you're never going to have sex."</p>
<p>"I wasn't plannin' on it…" Miley replied quietly, swallowing hard, "bein' with a guy." Her admission hung heavily in the air. Lilly said nothing and Miley didn't expect her to. What would Lilly say after –</p>
<p>"What do you mean you don't plan on having sex with a – ?" Miley slapped her hand over Lilly's very loud mouth, pinning her with a dangerous look.</p>
<p>"I promise you that you will not live to see another chocolate fountain if you finish that sentence," Miley growled. "Understand?" Lilly nodded, remaining silent when Miley removed her hand and began to distract herself with the banana once more. "Look, can we just forget I said anything?" Miley could tell by the look on Lilly's face that forgetting was not an option. Her secret – second only to her being Hannah Montana – was out in the open and there was nothing she could say. It wasn't as if she could tell Lilly about the butterflies that flapped their wings erratically in her stomach every time they were near each other or how about the tears she shed when Lilly wasn't around.</p>
<p>"Is she cute?" Lilly asked finally, "The girl that really caught your attention, I mean. Is she cute?"</p>
<p>Miley stared at Lilly and took in the features of her beautiful face. Those clear blue eyes and perfectly arched eyebrows, those full lips that Miley was sure would fit perfectly against her own, and that pointed chin and defined jaw that Miley wanted to run her lips over.</p>
<p>"Very cute," Miley said dreamily.</p>
<p>Lilly suddenly lifted an eyebrow and waved her hand in front of Miley's face. Miley blinked and realized that she was in full-on dream mode, something that Lilly would recognize from past attractions to boys such as Jake and Jesse and Gabe.</p>
<p>"Were you…" Lilly paused for a moment, and it seemed to Miley that she was struggling with her words. "You just zoned out for like ten minutes. You were looking at <i>me</i>, weren't you? You think <i>I'm</i> cute."</p>
<p>"I – uh – is that Orlando Bloom?" Miley exclaimed and pointed somewhere behind Lilly.</p>
<p>Lilly surprised Miley by not falling for it. "Miley…"</p>
<p>Miley didn't want to hear what Lilly had to say. There was no way this conversation could end up in her favor – Lilly was straight as a damn ruler, and just ended a long-term relationship with Oliver Oken – and this was certainly not the place to have a conversation that would surely break her heart. Besides that, anything that would come out of her mouth would only break her heart. Miley couldn't handle heartbreak, not from Lilly Truscott.</p>
<p>"No, Lilly," Miley said sharply, her hands falling into her lap. "Forget I said anything."</p>
<p>The rest of health was spent in an uncomfortable silence. Miley wanted nothing more than to open up to Lilly. Even more than being the girl she was so interested in that it hurt sometimes, Lilly was first and foremost her best friend in the whole world. But she couldn't bring herself to talk it out with Lilly. And when health ended nearly twenty minutes later, Miley packed up her stuff and walked out of the school.</p>
<p><i>"Miley has left the building."</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">—</p>
<p>"…and then I came home and told you this ridiculous story about how I ruined my life." Miley finished, using a napkin to wipe the corner of her mouth where she could feel a blob of mayo. "As you can see, it was clearly a life-or-death situation and I had to get out of there."</p>
<p>"Mile…" Robby Ray sighed and looked past Miley. "Do you really think leaving school was the best thing to do? You can't avoid Lilly forever – she lives with us! You two share a room!"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Then I can avoid her until school lets out. And maybe I can take Blue Jeans out for a really long ride. Hey, maybe I can even take my guitar and just sit out in the fields while I play. Doesn't that sound fantastic?"</p>
<p>Robby Ray rolled his eyes. "Your plan sounds wonderful, darlin', and it would'a worked had she not just walked in the door," he explained, motioning toward the young woman coming to stand behind Miley.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on!" Again, Miley found herself wanting to bang her head on the table as she felt the presence creeping up on her, the warmth rolling off of Lilly in waves as she stood behind Miley. "Why me?"</p>
<p>"You two need to fix this, understand?" Robby Ray told them sternly as he stood, and then he was gone.</p>
<p>Lilly kneeled down and gently ran a hand over the back of Miley's head, her fingers scraping her scalp. Miley let out a shuddering sigh and propped her head up on her fist, looking tiredly down at Lilly. Lilly dropped her hand to her knee and stood up. "Come on," she said softly, "We need to talk." Miley felt like throwing up as she followed Lilly into their room, and very nearly did as she turned to sit down on her bed and found Lilly watching her closely. "How come I never saw it before?"</p>
<p>Miley ducked her head and said nothing, not uttering even a single word when Lilly kneeled down in front of her. Miley squeezed her eyes shut and let out a shaky breath, then reopened them to blink back the moisture pooling. Tears were on the verge of falling from the corners of her eyes and Miley was frustrated. She was angry at herself for letting her attraction to Lilly – her <i>need</i> for her – show. She was upset about Lilly and her damn good looks that managed to captivate her without her even noticing. And God, she was so frustrated with these feelings that couldn't go on any longer.</p>
<p>"Miley…"</p>
<p>Miley stared down at Lilly. Then, with very little thought as to what she was doing, Miley lifted her hands to cup Lilly's cheeks and pulled her upward as she leaned down. Their lips met at once and the first thing Miley noticed beyond the sheer softness of Lilly's lips was how stiff Lilly was beneath her. But she couldn't stop kissing Lilly. It was too good, too satisfying to tear her lips away. Lilly finally began to move under her and deepened the kiss considerably, but only for a moment. Hands pushed against her chest and Miley pulled back, licking her lips as she did so. Through half-hooded eyes, Miley considered Lilly. Lilly sat down on her backside and propped herself up on her arms, giving Miley just as much attention.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, chuckling softly. "That was… weird." Miley's face fell, her heart hurting at Lilly's words. <i>Weird?</i> "Oh – oh, no – Miley," Lilly sighed and ran a hand through her hair. "I didn't mean it like that, Miles. You have to know that. I just… this is a weird situation."</p>
<p>"I guess." Miley mumbled.</p>
<p>"It is," Lilly confirmed, "But it's not… unappealing. I mean, I was thinking on the way home. And I decided that, maybe, I could be attracted to you, too. Or maybe more… a <i>lot</i> more, you know?"</p>
<p>"Lilly…" Miley forced out, "Don't say that just because you know how I feel now. Don't tell me that just to make me happy."</p>
<p>"I would never do that," Lilly said and Miley knew it was true. "It's just that… I love kissing you," she said suddenly, smiling shyly. "I love touching you in any way and sometimes I get really sad when you're not around and when I see you, I just want to… <i>dance</i> because I'm crazy happy. Do you feel like that, too?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded and slid down to the floor, sitting on her knees in front of Lilly. "Yeah," Miley said quietly, "That's exactly how I feel."</p>
<p>Lilly sat straighter and scooted closer to Miley, smiling when Miley straddled her thighs. Miley's eyes fluttered shut at the feel of Lilly's fingers splayed out against her cheeks and the sensation of being pulled forward and kissed so softly, so lovingly she felt she could cry. Kissing Lilly was so much more than she had ever imagined – and she did imagine it many times with Lilly only feet away from her – and Lilly tasted so good, so sweet on her tongue. Lilly was slick and warm and her tongue was caressing Miley's in a way that would have made her knees buckle had they been standing upright, and pulling back to draw a breath was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Lilly suddenly reached down and pulled something out of her pocket. "Mr. Johnson… you left before he could give you one of these," she explained breathlessly, holding up a condom wrapper between her index finger and thumb. "It's our responsibility to have safe sex, you know."</p>
<p>Miley laughed throatily and swooped down to kiss Lilly before placing her lips near her ear, whispering hotly, "I don't think we'll be needin' those tonight, Lilly. Or any other night, for that matter." She knew full well that they wouldn't be having sex anytime soon, she definitely wasn't ready to take that step yet, but that didn't mean she couldn't tease her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"If you don't stop talking in that sexy accent of yours, I'm not going to be able to wait until tonight. Although, I do like how thick it gets when you're turned on." Lilly teased.</p>
<p>There was nothing that Miley could say to bounce back from that comment. Rather than say anything at all, she wound her arms around Lilly and rested her head against Lilly's shoulder. Miley sighed in content at the feel of Lilly's arms holding her tightly.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?"</p>
<p>A soft <i>hmm</i> sounded from deep in her throat. "Yes, Lilly," she responded softly, "I'm just happy."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Lilly ran her hands up and down Miley's back in languid strokes and pressed her lips to the top of Miley's head, letting them linger against her hair.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Miley purred. "I love health class."</p>
<p>"I thought you loved <i>me</i>."</p>
<p>"I do," Miley admitted softly, getting a deep kiss in return. After several moments, Miley pulled back and gave Lilly a teasing grin, "You know, I was thinking…" Lilly hummed in response. Her attention was solely on the lips that found their way to her jaw, steadily making their way down to her exposed neck.</p>
<p>"How ironic is it that Mr. <i>Johnson</i> gave us condoms?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>fin</i></p>
<p><i><hr size=1 noshade></i>I don't even know about this.</p>
