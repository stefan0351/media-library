<!-- High School Hell \ Backrubs And Office Visits -->

<p>Sam was lying on her bed with her top half hanging over the edge letting all the blood rush to her head. She wasn't sure why, it was just something to do while she was bored and avoided her homework. She was starting to see spots in her vision and giggled. (That's probably not good) she told herself. There was a knock on her door. </p>
<p>"Come in," she called. The door opened and in walked Brooke, upside down to Sam's point of view. This made her laugh harder. Brooke tilted her head to look at her reclined lover. </p>
<p>"Uhm, whatcha doin' Sammy?" she asked slightly bewildered. Sam's face was red and she was hanging upside down. While it had been months since she's recovered from her coma, a small paranoid part of Brooke's brain pointed out logically that that couldn't be a good position for someone who once experienced severe head trauma. </p>
<p>"Nothin'," Sam answered, still staring at Brooke from her viewpoint. "If you come a little closer, I might be able to see up your skirt." Brooke rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Typical Sam," she muttered. "Sit up you hormone driven lust bucket," Brooke mock ordered. Sam pretended to pout and then tried to sit up. She wobbled for a second and Brooke eventually had to help her back onto the bed. </p>
<p>"Whoa, head rush," Sam mumbled as she closed her eyes and waited for the dizziness to pass. Brooke sat down on the bed beside her and pulled her into a heated kiss. </p>
<p>"What were you doing that for, Einstein?" she asked after they parted. Sam smiled and shrugged. </p>
<p>"Bored, and stretching my back," she explained. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Back still bothering you?" she asked. Sam's back had been hurting lately, probably a remnant from the accident. Sam nodded and sighed. "Take off your shirt and lay down on your stomach, I'll give you a back massage." Sam arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Ooooh," she teased, "is that what they call it these days?" Brooke swatted her on the arm. </p>
<p>"As much as I would love to join you in the gutter your mind has jumped into, Mom and Dad are home so it really will be a back rub. Like the ones I used to give you after your therapy sessions." Sam pouted for real for a minute before complying. </p>
<p>"I've missed these massages," she admitted after laying down. Brooke smiled and began to rub Sam's back. </p>
<p>"All you had to do was say something and I would have gladly given you one. I used to love that part of your therapy because it gave me a reason to touch you when I thought I'd never get the chance to," Brooke told her quietly. Sam laughed lowly. </p>
<p>"It's strange the way things work out, isn't it?" she asked as Brooke continued. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I never thought you'd love me back," Brooke said, a hint of awe and wonder still in her voice at the fact that Sam loved her. </p>
<p>"With all my heart and soul Princess," Sam confessed. Brooke said nothing but moved her hands to the center of Sam's back. "OW!" Sam's body all but leaped off the bed involuntarily, scaring Brooke. Sam was panting and her eyes were screwed shut in pain. </p>
<p>"What Sam, what is it?" Brooke asked worriedly. Sam shook her head, unable to speak for a second and tears were leaking past her eyelids. "Should I get Mom?" Sam shook her head a little harder. </p>
<p>"No, `m fine," she gasped. "Give me a sec," she panted as the wave of agony passed. She hadn't felt that much pain in a long time. She opened her eyes and saw the fear, guilt, and concern in Brooke's hazel ones. </p>
<p>"I'm OK, you didn't do anything wrong," she immediately assured her terror stricken girlfriend. She reached up and wiped away the pain-induced tears. "I don't know what the Hell that was but, ow," she joked weakly. Brooke moved a little closer. </p>
<p>"Let me see if there are any bruises," she offered. Sam turned around and Brooke inspected the area, careful not to touch it again. "I don't think I see anything, Sam but I think we should take you to the Doctor." </p>
<p>"I hate doctors, Brooke, you know that," Sam pointed out as she put her shirt back on. Brooke rolled her eyes. Yes, Sam McPherson's loathing of doctors was now legendary in their corner of the universe. As a matter of fact, when any hospital staff saw her coming, they ran in the other direction.</p>
<p>"I know Sam, but think of it this way, which is worse: doctors or the wheelchair again if there's something wrong with your back?" Sam winced.</p>
<p>"What was the number again?" Sam asked. </p>

<p>**</p>

<p>Sam swung her feet back and forth as she, Brooke and Jane waited for the doctor to return with her test results. God, she was bored. She watched as her feet swung back and forth, back and forth. Then she changed the rhythm, right leg, left, left, right, up, down, side to side. And to think, she used to take this for granted. </p>
<p>"Stop that, I'm getting dizzy," Brooke whispered, putting her hand on one of Sam's thighs to still the offending limb. </p>
<p>"Sorry," Sam mumbled. "I'm bored." </p>
<p>"Yes, you've mentioned this a few thousand times," Brooke pointed out impatiently. "So am I but there's nothing we can do but wait." Jane watched the two with a barely concealed smile. Sam saw it and called her on it.</p>
<p>"What's so funny?" she asked, more for conversation that actual interest. Her mother's sense of humor bordered on the strange lately.</p>
<p>"The looks on both your faces when the x-ray tech asked if there was any possible way you could be pregnant," both girls stared at her for a second before bursting out laughing. </p>
<p>"I don't think he understood why you turned to me and asked `Brooke, is there anything you need to tell me about yourself?', Sam," Brooke howled with laughter at the memory of the poor x-ray tech's face at Sam's thinly disguised innuendo. Sam snickered. </p>
<p>"I don't think he got it either," she conceeded. "And you answering with `I think you would have noticed that' only helped to further confuse him," she started to laugh again. There was one x-ray tech who was going to be trying to figure that one out for a while. The doctor chose just then to walk in the room. </p>
<p>"Glad to see some of my patients enjoying themselves," he said with a smile. "Sam, Jane, Brooke, I'd like to say it's good to see you but frankly, it's not." The smiles faded quickly from their faces and the mood suddenly turned somber. </p>
<p>"What's wrong with my back, Dr. Parker?" Sam asked straight out and slightly afraid. </p>
<p>"Relax, Sam, it's nothing unexpected really. When the car hit you last spring, it did a lot of damage to both bone and muscle." Brooke paled at the memory and Jane sighed. It really wasn't anything they wanted to relive.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I remember," Sam told him darkly. "Vividly." Dr. Parker nodded, getting the hint to move on. </p>
<p>"Well, even though you've healed remarkably well, you're bound to have some residual effects from injuries as catastrophic as yours were," he pulled out the sheet and put it up to show them. "Your x-ray shows a few very tiny bone fragments presumably from when your ribs broke are still imbedded in the muscles of your back." </p>
<p>"Is she in any danger from them, Dr.?" Jane asked worriedly as Sam and Brooke stared at the image of tiny flecks dotting the x-ray of Sam's back. </p>
<p>"Well, normally, no, if she takes it easy. We could try and remove the larger ones through surgery but we might actually do more harm than good. The back is a tricky place to do surgery," Sam was all ready shaking her head. </p>
<p>"Look, are they in any danger of like piercing an artery or my spinal chord?" she asked. Dr. Parker shook his head. </p>
<p>"They're no where near either, Sam. I suspect what you experienced the other day was a fluke, a shifting of a fragment against a particular nerve ending or possibly a bad muscle spasm. Tell me, has it happened again since?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, actually since then my back's felt better," Sam admitted.</p>
<p>"Well, you'll have to come in for periodic x-rays and CAT scans so we can monitor the fragments," Sam rolled her eyes. "But other than that and some anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants and pain meds for when it flares again, there's nothing I can really do." </p>
<p>"Any restrictions on what she can do?" Jane asked. Sam groaned. She hated it when her mother got over protective. </p>
<p>"No sky-diving, no heavy lifting, no wrestling with guys three times your size," Dr. Parker joked. "Normal common sense things really." </p>
<p>"No Gym class?" Sam asked hopefully. </p>
<p>"Depends on the sport of the day. You need the exercise to keep your back strong and healthy, Sam. But no contact sports, like football. And periodic physical therapy sessions to evaluate your back." </p>
<p>"OK, I got it," Sam grumbled. They stood up to leave. Dr. Parker turned to Sam one last time. </p>
<p>"Sam, you've come a long way. We call you our miracle patient because when you arrived here, none of us expected you to survive the night," he admitted. "Thanks for proving us wrong." Sam gave him a wry smile. </p>
<p>"My pleasure." </p>
