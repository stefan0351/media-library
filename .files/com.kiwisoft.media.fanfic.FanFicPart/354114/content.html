<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 34 -->

<p>Brooke stopped walking as she sensed Sam freeze up behind her.
Turning around she saw the brunette starring at the double doors
leading into Kennedy High with a look of terror on her face.  She
looks like I feel, Brooke thought to herself as she backtracked so
that she was standing beside Sam once again.  Looking at the doors
herself she knew exactly what Sam was thinking, and that thinking it
wasn't going to do them any good.  They had spent yesterday evening
freaking themselves out, and it would do them no good to start again.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" the blonde asked looking over at her girlfriend.
She wanted to get this over with.  What was done was done, and the
sooner they found out whether or not they had become total social
rejects, the sooner she would be able to fill out her transfer papers
and go where she had always wanted to, Beverly Hills High.  </p>

<p>Sam looked over at her and smirked.  "Does it really matter?" she
asked, her body relaxing somewhat.  </p>

<p>"I really don't think that it does," Brooke responded with a similar
expression.  They had to go in sooner or later.  "Come on, let's get
this over with," she said reaching over and taking Sam's hand into
hers.  "What's your first class?" Brooke asked trying to distract
both Sam and herself as they pushed through the doors.</p>

<p>"English," Sam responded looking around them with what she hoped were
inconspicuous glances.  She felt a bit funny, it didn't really feel
like anyone was watching them.  She had developed a kind of sixth
sense for it over the past couple of days, and she wasn't detecting
the curious stares.</p>

<p>"I'll walk you," Brooke responded decisively.  </p>

<p>"You're a good girlfriend," Sam responded smiling over at her.</p>

<p>"That's what I keep saying," Brooke replied somewhat distractedly as
she squeezed Sam's hand reassuringly.  Something was different today,
people weren't paying as much attention to them as they had been
previously.  Brooke had expected, more staring, maybe some pointed
comments, but there were only a few sideways glances and low murmurs.</p>

<p>They walked the rest of the way to Sam's classroom in relative
silence, drawing strength from each others presence while staving off
their paranoia.  When they arrived in front of the room there was
still a few minutes before the bell rang, so they joined the small
crowd of students that were lounging by the doorway waiting to be let
in.  There were about four singles hanging about and one couple off
to their left.  Everyone turned to look at them when they approached,
but then they soon turned back to whatever it was they had been doing
before the brunette and blonde arrived.</p>

<p>Sam quirked an eyebrow at Brooke, and the cheerleader shrugged with a
somewhat confused expression on her face.  This was unexpected.</p>

<p>"It's like nobody cares," Brooke whispered into Sam's ear a moment
later.  To be sure they were receiving a few veiled looks from the
people around them, and passerby's, but for the most part the looks
were just curious, nothing more.  The thought brought a smile to her
face and she could feel laughter building up inside of.  Impetuously
she leaned over and kissed Sam on the cheek, pulling back just before
the laughter that was bubbling in her stomach boiled over.  "We were
just gossip," she said softly as she began to laugh, in fact it was
really more of a giggle.  They had just been the latest gossip,
nobody really gave a good god damn, it was just something to talk
about.  Nicole's threats, her own apprehension, it didn't really mean
anything.  They were hardly the first gay couple at the school, hell
they even had an openly gay teacher.  In the larger scheme of things,
nobody really cared that she was sleeping with Sam other than as a
conversation piece, or leverage, or gossip.  There would come a time
today, or the next day, or the next day, where someone would say
something derogatory about them, that was as inevitable as death and
taxes, as the world was filled with assholes, and their relationship
was easy to attack.  But on a whole, they were just one more couple
walking down the hallway.  With everything they had put themselves
through, it was looking as if nobody really gave a flying fuck.  </p>

<p>Brooke leaned against the wall as she laughed.  That was hilarious,
in fact is was so funny that it almost made her want to cry.   </p>
