<!-- Sunny Daze \ Part 1 -->

<p>Two weeks. That's how long I've been waiting for Faith to get here.
It seems so much longer than that, especially since I still didn't
know anyone in this town. Mom had opened an art gallery and found a
great deal on this house as she so likes to point out from time to
time. Apparently, it was a steal. She's not here right now. She's
picking Faith up from LA and they're supposed to get here any minute.
My stomach's been churning since this morning and sitting here
waiting for them isn't helping my nerves. It's kind of strange to
think of Faith as my sister but that's technically who she is
now...in the eyes of the law anyway.</p>

<p>I clicked on the remote again and flipped through the channels of the
TV. There wasn't really much to pick from in the weekday morning
lineup but I wasn't really paying attention anyway. I was way too
distracted, listening for mom's car to get into the driveway. Pretty
soon, I started obsessively looking at the clock, wondering if the
batteries were going dead or something. I was just starting to get up
and see if that was the case when the faint sound of a car stopping
outside made me hop up and run to the door.</p>

<p>Stepping outside, I waited on the doorstep as the car door opened and
Faith stepped out. She looked around and then her eyes locked on
mine. A large smile began spreading across her face as she walked
around the car and right up to me, immediately pulling me into a
smothering hug. In all the time I've imagined our reunion, I never
even came close to imagining how good it would feel finding myself
buried in Faith's arms again. </p>

<p>"Hey sis," she whispered in my ear. "Miss me?"</p>

<p>Her voice sent a shiver running through my body and instead of
answering, I just held on tighter.</p>

<p>Mom's voice came from the side as she got out of the car. "How about
we get inside first girls?"</p>

<p>Faith pulled away as she gave mom a crooked smile. "Sorry Mrs. S. Let
me grab my bag." She went to the trunk of the car and took out a
duffel bag before following us into the house.</p>

<p>"Why don't you show Faith her room while I get lunch started?" Mom
asked with an indulgent smile as I grabbed Faith's hand and
practically dragged her upstairs.</p>

<p>"So how have you been? What've you been doing? Was the ride over all
right?" The questions just seemed to tumble and trip their way out of
my mouth and when I looked back at Faith, she had a smirk on her
face. "I'm babbling aren't I? You should stop me when I babble."</p>

<p>"Why?" She asked. "It's so unbelievably cute. And anyway, I've missed
hearing your voice, B."</p>

<p>I'm sure my insides have already turned into the consistency of
melted wax at those words. "You're not the only one that's been
missing. I've missed your nickname for me."</p>

<p>She gave me another easy smile as I led her into her room. I
carefully watched her face to gauge a reaction as she walked further
into the room and slowly turned around, her eyes wandering over
everything. The bed with its light blue comforter, the window looking
down into the backyard, the large, antique dresser mom had brought a
few years ago at an auction and the bookshelf that was just waiting
for someone to fill it up. Her bag dropped out of her hand as she
turned back to me again. She looked down briefly at the floor before
bringing her eyes back to mine. "This is...Shit, B, I've never had
all this before. I still can't believe this is happening to me."</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" I asked, slowly walking up to stand in front of her.</p>

<p>"B," she said, taking my hands in hers and staring intently at me. "I
love it...Thank you." We continued looking at each other, neither one
of us saying anything because nothing needed to be said. My hand
reached up to brush her hair back, tucking the thick strands behind
her ear. </p>

<p>"It healed beautifully," I said, referring to the gash she'd gotten
at the party with Jack. "You can't even tell it was ever busted open."</p>

<p>"Time heals all wounds," she said drolly. "Especially the ones given
by drunken pricks." Her eyebrow quirked up as we shared a chuckle
over the incident. She turned around suddenly and belly flopped onto
her bed. "So how's the vamp situation around here?" She asked,
rolling lazily onto her back.</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes. "Do we have to talk about that now? It's the middle
of the day, the sun is shining, the mood is happy, why do you want to
ruin it by talking about undead demon blood suckers? Blood, blood,
blood, suck, suck, suck. That's all they ever think about. Where's
the fun? Where's the fun for *me*?"</p>

<p>She just looked at me until I finally threw up my hands in defeat. I
plopped down next to her and went through what I knew about the
Sunnydale vampire populace. Not that much different from the LA crowd
but there seemed to be more of them, especially for such a small town
like Sunnydale. "And another thing, there's tons of cemeteries around
this place. It's like you can't go two blocks without running into
another one. It's insane how many dead people they have."</p>

<p>"Hmmm. Wow. Sounds dead," she said looking at me with a straight face.</p>

<p>I punched her on the arm. "Stop with the mocking," I said, trying not
to grin.</p>

<p>"Hey, if you keep hitting me like that, I probably will," she said,
rubbing the spot on her arm where I'd punched her.</p>

<p>I scrunched up my brow. "Is that a promise or a threat?" I wasn't
prepared at all when she suddenly jumped on top of me and began
tickling my sides. "Stop, stop," I pleaded with her in between
giggles. She gave no mercy, continuing to turn me into a laughing
puddle of goo and only jumping off when mom's voice yelled from
downstairs that lunch was ready.</p>

<p>"How did...how did you know I was ticklish?" I asked, trying to catch
my breath.</p>

<p>"I didn't," she said simply, winking at me and disappearing out the
door. When I'd finally gotten myself together enough to go
downstairs, I found Faith and mom sitting at the dining room table
talking about school. I groaned as I sat down across from Faith,
wondering why they had to bring up something so distasteful while we
were trying to eat. I still hadn't gotten over how I was so
unceremoniously expelled from my last school. I don't think mom had
either. I think she believed me when I told her that I didn't mean to
blow up the gym but the fact was, I *had* blown it up. I wished I
could tell her the real reason why but that would just freak her out
and put her in danger. I can just imagine her reaction if I told her
that I was a vampire Slayer and the reason why I burned the gym down
was because it was full of vampires at the time. Yeah, she'd probably
have me committed or worse, grounded for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I watched in amusement as mom tried to sucker Faith into
participating in some after school activities. I'd already gotten the
speech a couple times already since we got to Sunnydale so I was glad
there was someone else for mom to lay her hard sell on. Faith nodded
and agreed in all the appropriate places and when she mentioned that
she'd joined the track team at her last school, mom began to latch
onto that like a pitbull with a bone. I think she thought that if we
were too busy doing school sanctioned activities, we'd also be too
busy to fall into the wrong crowd either.</p>

<p>After lunch, mom gave Faith and me some money to go shopping. I
thanked her with a kiss on the cheek and Faith gave her a big grin.
School, that hallowed institution of higher learning -- or was that
college? -- was starting tomorrow....at least the second half of the
semester. On a Thursday. I don't really know how they came up with
the wacky scheduling for these things and it was short notice,
especially for Faith. But she didn't seem to mind.</p>

<p>"I'm used to it," was all she'd said when I asked. There are some
things that Faith is reluctant to talk about. It's almost like
pulling teeth when certain subject matters come up. And one of those
subjects is her history. All I know are the bare bones of it. I know
that her mom and dad are dead. I know she's been alone in the world
for most of her life and that she's been dumped from one foster
family to another but aside from that, nothing. And that's a problem
because, like I'd said before, I want to know everything there is to
know about Faith. I want to know about all the things that have
happened to her to make her the wonderful and complex person that I
know now.</p>

<p>"All done," she said, holding an armful of clothes she'd picked up in
less than twenty minutes. Yes, Faith is a complex girl but not in the
fashion sense in any way, shape, or form. Tank tops, spaghetti string
tops, tube tops, T-shirts all in one of three basic colors: black,
white, and dark red. The pants she has picked out are even more
straight forward. Leather and denim, all black of course.</p>

<p>"You can't be all done," I said looking over at her plaintively. "I
haven't even begun to shop." At her exasperated expression, I
forcefully added, "Go back and pick out some more stuff --- maybe
something a little more colorful."</p>

<p>She shook her head and walked away but not before I heard her mutter
that "Black *is* a color." </p>

<p>I went back to looking through a rack of clothes and was just
deciding between getting the powder blue or the mauve skirt when
Faith came back again. "What did you get?" I asked, frowning at her
suspiciously. </p>

<p>She held up a pack of underwear. "Colorful isn't it?" She asked with
a smirk.</p>

<p>I groaned in dismay. "Fine. If you don't want to shop the right way,
why don't you just pay for that and wait for me in the food court."</p>

<p>She gave me a wide grin. "Thanks B. Try not to spend all day in
here 'k?" She walked away before I could come up with a proper
retort. </p>

<p>I really wasn't keeping track of the time but when I was finally
satisfied with my new wardrobe, it was later in the day than I had
anticipated. Hurrying over to the food court, I looked everywhere but
couldn't find Faith so I found myself an empty table and dumped all
the shopping bags on the chair next to me, hoping that Faith had just
gotten bored waiting and would come back from where ever she'd
gone...soon. In the meantime, I sipped from the soda I'd gotten and
spent the time people watching.</p>

<p>I was so engrossed watching a group of little old ladies walking
aimlessly around the floor that I nearly jumped out of my skin when
someone tapped me on the shoulder. Faith walked up from behind me and
smirked.</p>

<p>"Where's that famous Slayer sense?" She asked, straddling a chair.</p>

<p>"You mean the one where I can tell when a certain someone's going to
appear out of nowhere and scare me for no good reason at all?" She
stared innocently at me from across the table. "I don't know. It must
be on the fritz. Where were you?" I asked a little peeved.</p>

<p>She folded her arms on the table and stared intently at me. "B, do I
need to remind you which one of us has been shopping for three hours?
Cause if I need to, I'll start naming names."</p>

<p>I could feel myself reddening slightly at her stare. "I guess I got a
little carried away," I replied sheepishly.</p>

<p>She lazily glanced over at my bags. "I guess you did," she said with
another smirk. "Please tell me you're done."</p>

<p>"I'm done," I said, watching as she looked heavenward and uttered a
silent Thank you. "Come on you," I said, gathering up my bags. "I
want to get back home so I can show you what I bought." I ignored her
groan and shoved some of my bags into her hand as she got up.</p>

<p>She looked at me like I was crazy or something. "Why am I holding
*your* bags, B?"</p>

<p>"Because," I patiently explained, "I know you wouldn't want me
dragging all these bags by myself." She looked like she was actually
mulling that over when I walked around her and forcefully nudged her
out.</p>

<p>"Hey," she complained as I kept pushing her forward, "Stop with the
man-handling. I'm still thinking." </p>

<p>"Okay," I said nonplussed. "You can think all the way to the car but
you're still going to hold my bags."</p>

<p>I heard her laugh out loud but at least she didn't drop them. When we
got back home, the first thing I did was drag her upstairs after
yelling "We're home" at the top of my lungs. Pushing her onto my bed,
I began rooting through the bags, trying to mix and match my outfits
for that maximum mesh of classy coolness and hint of sexy aura to
spice it up. Faith took out a comic book she'd gotten somewhere and
began reading as I changed.</p>

<p>"How's this?" I asked, twirling around.</p>

<p>She glanced over at me for about one second and said, not too
convincingly, "Fine."</p>

<p>I put my hands on my hips in the classic slightly pissed
posture. "You think you can at least pretend to look?"</p>

<p>She sighed, throwing the comic off to the side as she got up and
walked right up to me. "It doesn't matter what you have on, B. Cause
to me, you're always going to be beautiful. And I think that's the
only way I'll ever be able to see you whether you have on a potato
sack or a polyester pants suit or whatever." She shrugged, walking
past me and out the door. I just stood there for a few minutes, my
mouth gaping open before a big grin started spreading across my face.
That just totally made my day...week.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I had already finished eating breakfast by the time Buffy finally
hauled her ass out of bed. Mrs. Summers, who insisted I call her mom
from now on, had to bang on her door twice before she made an
appearance --- kinda like a groundhog peaking around for its shadow.
She looked wicked cute though, all sleepy and grouchy like that.</p>

<p>"Don't want to be late for your first day, B," I said, teasing her as
she sat down at the counter with a plate of waffles in front of her.</p>

<p>"I am not going to be late," she said through a mouthful of half
chewed waffle bits. "And if I am, then you're going to be too."</p>

<p>"Okay you two, I'm leaving for work," mom said, stopping briefly at
the kitchen entrance as she put on her earring. "Faith, make sure
Buffy isn't late. I'll see you tonight."</p>

<p>"Since when did you become the responsible one?" Buffy grumpily
asked, staring at me from across the table.</p>

<p>I smirked at her and just tapped my watch. When we got to the school
fifteen minutes later, Buffy's car screeched into the parking lot,
barely nicking the bumper of another car when it made the sudden
turn. I nearly bit my own tongue off at the unexpectedly jerking
stop. Sometimes, I wondered if Buffy knew exactly how bad of a driver
she was and who she had to bribe to pass the driving test. But
there's one thing I have to give her credit for. She hasn't hit
anything...yet. </p>

<p>We were walking to the front of the school when I heard some panicked
shouts, followed almost immediately by the crash and burn of some
goofy Tony Hawk wannabe slamming into the metal handrail of the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Nobody worry, I"m all right," he announced, quickly jumping back up
with a noticeable wince. </p>

<p>I flipped his board, grabbing it by the wheelbase. "Then you might
want to hold onto this," I said, holding it up to him.</p>

<p>"Uh, thanks," he said, staring at us with a glazed over expression.
When he didn't take his board right away, I shoved it into his chest
and Buffy and me walked past him and into the school. </p>

<p>We were supposed to see the Principal first so he could personally
welcome us. When we got to his office, "Bob", who told us to call him
that even though he said nobody actually called him that to his face,
sat us down and gave us this speech about how fair he was and how
starting at his school would be our opportunities for a clean slate.
And he even went so far as to tear up our transcripts to show us how
serious he was...that was, before he noticed that little asterisk
next to Buffy's name that mentioned something about the burning down
of a certain gym. After that, he was a lot less caring, new age guy
and a lot more closed off, taping-the-transcripts-back-together-again
guy. </p>

<p>"Not the dream start I'd envisioned," Buffy dejectedly said as I
walked her to her first class. </p>

<p>"It could've gone worse," I said, trying to cheer her up. "At least
now it's over, right?"</p>

<p>"Faith," she said, stopping me at the entrance of a classroom. "We
still haven't even gotten through the rest of the day yet."</p>

<p>"But we will," I assured her with much more confidence than I
felt. "See you at lunch?" I almost went to give her a hug but I
stopped in time and just gave her a wink before walking towards my
own class. When had I become this strange clingy, touchy feely
person, anyway? I realized, it was only when I was with Buffy that I
was like that. With everybody else, I'm always trying to keep them at
arm's length, both with the physical and the emotional parts of me.
But with Buffy, it's like we connected even before we talked. We
were 'kindred spirits.' That's a term I got out of a Batman comic
book. Who says comics aren't educational?</p>

<p>I walked into my first class which hadn't even started yet. At least
that's what it looked like. Everybody was talking, some were walking
around, and one or two other people looked like they were asleep.
There was some old guy sitting behind the teacher's desk but since he
didn't seem too interested in taking my name or anything, I just
grabbed a seat in the back, put up my feet and went to sleep. Last
night had been a total fucked up mess. I hadn't been able to get to
sleep and when I did manage to doze off, I woke in a cold sweat every
time. I must've been dreaming but the thing was, I couldn't remember
what it'd been about. Only that I felt like shit the whole entire
night. And even though the class room wasn't the most quiet place in
the world, I found myself asleep as soon as my eyes closed.</p>

<p>The ringing of the bell woke me with a start and my feet fell from
the desk onto the floor with a thump as everyone else started filing
out of the room ahead of me. I let out a yawn and stretched, hoping
the rest of my classes would be this relaxing. </p>

<p>They weren't.</p>

<p>They were the same old boring lectures that had always made me want
to gauge my eyes out with a rusty spoon just so I'd have something to
do with my hands. When lunch rolled around, I was more than ready for
a break. I walked outside onto the school grounds where different
groups were already beginning to gather. I spotted Buffy talking to
some red headed chick and I was starting to head towards them when I
felt someone bumping me from behind. Turning around, I came face to
face with this tall, dark-haired hottie who was probably one of the
most beautiful girls I've ever seen in my life, and she would've been
even more beautiful if she didn't have that frown on her face.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," she haughtily said. "But do you mind watching where I'm
going?"</p>

<p>Letting my eyes run slowly up and down her frame, I said with a
leer, "No, I don't mind. I'd actually *like* to watch you go."</p>

<p>She seemed startled by my naked assessment but to her credit, she
quickly made a recovery. "You're obviously new around here so let me
give you a clue. If you're looking for people more your style, the
slutty, white trash don't get out of their trailers till half past
one. Until then, please keep your Salvation Army self away from me."</p>

<p>"I'm wounded," I said, stepping in front of her before she could huff
past. "And here I thought that was a love tap you'd given me. Don't
tell me that didn't mean as much to you as it did to me."</p>

<p>"You're a freak," she finally said, pushing past me, her composure
cracking ever so slightly.</p>

<p>I watched her go, my eyes inevitably drawn down to her posterior.
Even though I was checking out some girl's ass, I don't think I could
label myself gay cause I checked out everybody. As long as they were
hot, it didn't matter whether they were a guy or a girl, I'd get
turned on. I hated labels anyway. They never really described a
living, breathing person, only some one-size fits all cardboard
cutout. I shook myself out of my inner rambling when I saw that the
hottie was walking straight towards Buffy who had attracted herself a
new guy while I was preoccupied. I thought I remembered him as the
one who'd nearly ran into us this morning.</p>

<p>Walking towards them, I heard him call her Cordelia. At least now I
had a name to put to the face and I now knew who I was pissing off. I
walked around Cordelia, brushing against her way more than I needed
to and moved next to Buffy. Cordelia wouldn't look at me cause she
was spending too much time glaring at Buffy. </p>

<p>"Buffy, do you know this...person?" She asked, folding her arms up in
a defensive posture.</p>

<p>"She should," I replied, putting an arm across Buffy's shoulder. "I'm
her sister."</p>

<p>Cordelia's face clouded over in confusion as she looked back and
forth between us. I could feel Buffy's arm snaking its way around my
waist and squeezing painfully. I just kept smiling as Cordelia
finally shook her head in disgust and walked away muttering something
about family trees.</p>

<p>As soon as she moved away, the guy from this morning blurted
out, "Wow, you're sisters?" He had that glazed over expression on his
face again and I could just see the wheels starting to turn in his
head.</p>

<p>The redheaded girl was the first to introduce herself. "Hi, I'm
Willow," she said, smiling shyly and giving a little wave. She poked
her friend in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Xander," he blurted out. He was kind of cute, in a goofy, bumbling
sorta way. But the guy looked like he'd dressed himself in the dark,
what with the neon green hawaiin shirt he was sporting.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm Faith," I said, flashing them all a brilliant smile. Never
hurt to put in a good first impression.</p>

<p>Buffy ducked out from under my arm, muttering that she had to go to
the library. I jogged to catch up with her. "What's the hurry?" I
asked, wondering at her cool attitude. "When did you start spending
lunch at the library?"</p>

<p>She ran up the stairs to the school and suddenly stopped in the
middle of the hallway and turned on me with a barely suppressed
glare. "When did you start checking out Cordelia's ass?"</p>

<p>"Is that what you're pissed about?" I folded my arms and leaned back
against the wall as I carefully looked at her. "I don't get it, B.
Why would that bother you? The girl's hot. What's wrong with me
checking her out? I never thought you'd be so...narrow-minded."</p>

<p>"I'm not...that's not what's bothering me." She shook her head,
frustrated and started walking away again but I snagged her arm,
holding her back.</p>

<p>"Then tell me what's the problem," I said, almost pleading with her. </p>

<p>But she shook my arm off and changed the subject instead. "Cordelia
mentioned that they'd found a dead body in the girl's locker room,"
she said, all business now. "I'm going there first to see if it was a
victim of a vampire attack. My new Watcher's also the school
librarian so if it turns out the dead guy was killed by a vampire,
I'm going to go there and see if he has any information." She turned
to leave again and this time I didn't try to stop her. Instead, I
followed, still wondering about what she could be so mad about. I
honestly had no idea. And then the thought struck me. Maybe Buffy had
actually wanted Cordelia as a friend and I, being a complete moron
that I was, had ruined that for her. After all, Buffy was used to
running with that kind of crowd. If that was it, I was all ready to
apologize and go to Cordelia myself and tell her that Buffy wasn't
really my sister, that we weren't even related. But, first things
first.</p>

<p>Buffy had already walked into the locker room having removed the
yellow police tape across the door. I followed her in as we searched
for the body which wasn't too hard to find. She reached out a hand
and turned the guy's head and there they were. Two little holes. </p>

<p>"I guess we have our answer," she said softly as we walked back out.</p>

<p>"Who's the new Watcher?" I asked, following her to the library.</p>

<p>"His name's Giles." She scrunched up her brows and I wondered if she
was thinking about Merrick again. I know she still blamed herself for
her ex-Watcher's death. She'd put herself through hell, trying to
shoulder all the guilt and it still surfaced now and again even
though she'd gotten a better handle on the pain over time. "Real
stuffy guy," she continued walking through the library doors.</p>

<p>As soon as she walked in, she was demanding to know what the
situation was. The guy, who I'm guessing is the new Watcher, looked
up from sorting his books or whatever and stuttered, "Sorry?" He was
all decked out in a tweed suit and an English accent which was kind
of sexy, if you liked that sort of thing. He kept looking nervously
over at me as Buffy explained what she'd seen.</p>

<p>"I don't believe we've met," he finally said to me.</p>

<p>"Faith," I told him. </p>

<p>His face immediately cleared up. "Oh, yes, of course." My name seemed
to mean something to him but I know I've never met the guy before.</p>

<p>"Okay, how about getting back to the vampire situation," Buffy said
impatiently. </p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this town?" He asked, ignoring her 'tude. </p>

<p>"No, but I'm sure you're going to give me a history lesson." Giles
went on to explain how Sunnydale was perfectly located to be this
magnet of demonic activity and that the vampire chew toy we'd found
was just the beginning of this weirdness. He ended his speech by
stating that the only way we could prepare for what was about to
come, which is pretty much anyone's guess, was to train hard.</p>

<p>Buffy had listened through his version of the 'state of the union'
speech with a pretty neutral expression on her face and when he'd
finished, she just asked, "Is that it?"</p>

<p>Giles wearily took off his glasses and started fiddling with
them. "Yes, that about covers the generalities." As soon as he said
that, Buffy turned and walked out the door. The G-man looked to me
with a confused expression on his face. "Was it something I said?"</p>

<p>I shook my head and took off after Buffy. We seriously had to talk.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith had come after me when I blew out of the library but I couldn't
deal with her asking all those questions which all basically boiled
down to why I was acting like this. She actually thought I was mad at
her because she'd made me look bad in front of Cordelia. God, I can't
believe she thinks I'm that shallow. I finally forced her to go to
class when the bell rang. We'd both missed lunch but I wasn't feeling
all that hungry anyway. Before she left, she gave me this last look
that almost made me want to tell her everything.</p>

<p>That is, if I knew how to voice what I was feeling inside but I
wasn't even too sure of that myself. Why had I gotten so mad in the
first place? I sat down in an empty chair of my next class, totally
unaware of anything else around me as I thought about it some more.
And I kept thinking about it throughout the rest of the day until
finally, I came to some conclusions. I wasn't mad that Faith had
checked out Cordelia although it kinda wigged me out at first. I'd
never really seen Faith flirt with anyone so overtly before. Mostly
because, usually, she was flirting with me. This was an epiphany that
had smacked me on the back of the head at the end of my last class. I
was used to Faith flirting with *me*. I just never consciously
thought of it as flirting before. It was almost like I was ---
jealous. Honestly, I think I missed the attention.</p>

<p>And then I wanted to slap myself because here I was pulling this mini-
tantrum the first time I didn't get *all* of Faith's attention and I
just let her believe that somehow it was all her fault and that she's
the one who's done something wrong. When I met her outside after
school, the first thing out of my mouth was, "I'm an idiot." When I
saw her frown in confusion, I smiled self-deprecatingly and took her
hand. "I'm sorry about today. I think it might have been all the
mystical energy in this place like Giles was talking about. Made me
act all not me..."</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed slightly but she didn't question my lame
explanation. If I'd told her the truth, she would've thought I was
this selfish, needy brat --- which I'm not.</p>

<p>"So you're back to the normal loveable B I know and worship like a TV
idol?" She asked with a grin.</p>

<p>"Completely," I said with all earnestness. "Now shouldn't you be
doing something?" She looked at me with a blank stare. "Shouldn't you
be trying out for the track team?" I prompted, nudging her as she got
that smirk on her face.</p>

<p>She stepped into me, her smirk growing soft and sultry as she looked
at me through her lashes. "You going to watch me?"</p>

<p>My breath caught in my throat as we stared at each other. This was
one of those flirty moments, the back of my brain was trying to say.
The front of my brain was just saying 'Duh, of course it is."</p>

<p>Faith broke eye contact and stepped back, making me want to groan out
loud. "So what do you say, B?" She asked, looking at me expectantly.</p>

<p>A grin spread across my own face. "Let's go," I said, gently nudging
her again.</p>

<p>Faith wowed the coach of course. By the end of one lap, I think I saw
coach Foster actually salivating. Faith ran a couple of more laps
before talking briefly with the coach and then jogging back over to
me. "Did I wow you or what?" She asked with a cocky expression.</p>

<p>"You have no idea," I grinned, standing up. We walked back to the
parking lot. "So, I'm guessing you made the track team?"</p>

<p>"I'm guessing your guess is right," she said, slipping into the
passenger's seat of my car. "You could join the team too, B," she
continued, looking over at me specutively. "You're probably way
better than me too since y'know, you *are* the Slayer."</p>

<p>"Not so much into the running," I said, shrugging. "I think I'll just
relax during my free time. What there is of it anyway. Giles seems
really gung-ho about me putting in the training time." I sighed just
thinking about my soon to be total lack of a social life.</p>

<p>"You know I'll be right there with you, right?"</p>

<p>"You don't have to--" I started to say.</p>

<p>"No, but I want to," Faith stated as if to do otherwise would be
unimaginable to her. And I absolutely adored her for that. </p>

<p>The rest of the day passed without incident. Mom quizzed us on our
day at the dinner table after which we listened to her talk about how
much there still was to do at the gallery. But it wasn't like she was
complaining, I think she really liked what she was doing now. I've
known my mom my whole life and I never even knew she was an art major
in college until she decided to open a gallery here. I guess to me,
she'll always be 'mom' --- not someone who has interests and
passions. Just having my mom and passions in the same thought
unnerved me so much that I put it out of my mind and thought instead
about what I was going to wear tonight.</p>

<p>I had heard from Willow that everybody at school hung out at this
club called The Bronze. Faith hadn't been too hard to convince on
coming. Mom was a little more difficult but we promised we'd be back
by our curfew so she finally relented. The hardest part was figuring
out what to wear.</p>

<p>"Come on, B," Faith groaned again, her voice muffled by the pillow
she'd thrown over her head. "Can we please go now? If you keep this
up, by the time you find something to wear, it'll already be curfew."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," I said, walking over and ripping the pillow
away. "I want to make an impression...a good one."</p>

<p>"How many times do I have to tell you?" She asked, rolling onto her
side and pinning me with her eyes. "You. Are. Beautiful. So just
throw something on so we can go and show you off already." She
wriggled her eyebrows in a lecherous way and I laughed, throwing the
pillow back at her.</p>

<p>I finally found something I was somewhat satisfied with and pretended
not to see when Faith jumped up, shouting Hallelujah. We were walking
to the Bronze when, all of a sudden, I started getting this really
strong vibe that something wasn't right. It was kind of like how
every time Spider Man sensed danger, his spidey senses would alert
him. I guess these were my spidey senses and they usually went off
when there was a bloodsucking vamp nearby. I took Faith's arm and
squeezed slightly, giving her a look and hoping she knew what I was
getting at.</p>

<p>I turned the both of us into an alley. Faith immediately went and hid
behind a dumpster and I jumped, catching a bar high above the ground.
I swung myself into a handstand waiting for whoever it was to come
looking. It wasn't too long before someone turned into the alley. I
waited for him to pass my position before I swung down and kicked him
in the back, sending him sprawling on the ground. I had my foot on
his chest when Faith walked up next to me.</p>

<p>"Why are you following us?" I asked, taking out my stake.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'm not going to bite," he said, holding still. "I came
to give you something."</p>

<p>"And what could that be?" Faith taunted by my side. "A bloody hickey?"</p>

<p>"If you'd just let me up--" He tried again, squirming beneath my
foot. I pushed down harder, feeling him tense.</p>

<p>"I'd rather turn you into dust," I said.</p>

<p>"I told you," he said, getting agitated. "I'm not here to hurt you.
And you might want to hear what I have to say."</p>

<p>"Haven't we heard that before?" I asked Faith with a smirk. "So start
spilling vampire," I said, turning back to the demon under my foot.</p>

<p>He blew out a weary sigh before speaking. "This town is sitting on
the Mouth of Hell and it's about to open. You have to be ready for
that. You have to get ready for the Harvest."</p>

<p>I frowned as a mental image of the Children of the Corn came popping
into my mind. Mr. Vampire carefully reached into his pocket and
brought out a black velvet box. "This is for you," he said tossing it
up to me. I grabbed it and he took the opportunity to get back up,
brushing the dirt off of his black overcoat. He walked around us,
going back out of the alley.</p>

<p>When he'd left Faith asked, "You think we should've just let him go
like that?"</p>

<p>I opened up the box and nestled inside was a silver cross on a
chain. "What sort of vampire gives a cross as a gift?" I asked,
frowning.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's a 'special' vampire," Faith said, emphasizing the word
special with her hands forming imaginary quotation marks. I burst out
with a bark of laughter and pushed her out of the alley. </p>

<p>When we reached the Bronze, all thoughts of the mystery vampire were
pushed to the back of my mind. Faith pushed her way through the crowd
to the bar and I followed her, my hand holding onto the back of her
tank top. For tonight, Faith had worn a tank top, leather pants, and
boots --- all in black. I envied how confident she always seemed and
how easily she can make me feel just as confident with a few choice
words. And, of course, borrowing some Faith speak, she looked wicked
hot in that get up too. She tossed me a bottle of water as she got
herself another one. It was then that I spotted a familar face
sitting at the bar. </p>

<p>I dragged Faith a few feet away to where Willow was sitting. "Hey," I
said, smiling as I got her attention.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello," she said, her eyes flicking between Faith and me. "You
guys made it." </p>

<p>We took seats at the table next to her. "You waiting for someone
Red?" Faith asked. I quirked an eyebrow at her, wondering at how fast
she'd christened Willow with a nickname already.</p>

<p>"Uh, well, not really," Willow stammered. "I was hoping that Xander
would show up but..."</p>

<p>"But since he's not here," Faith continued as she trailed off. "You
shouldn't be moping around this table, sitting by yourself. Go out
there and snag yourself a honey. Find the fun," she finished, taking
a drag from her bottle. I didn't get to hear Willow's response
because Faith had set down her bottle and grabbed my hand, leading me
onto the dance floor. I barely had time to set down my own bottle
before I found myself dancing to a song some band was playing out on
stage. I felt my body moving in time to the beat as my eyes wandered
lazily in front of me to where Faith was putting on a one woman show. </p>

<p>Her eyes were closed, her lips, covered in that dark, red lipstick
she likes so much were open slightly, and her hands were raised,
running sensuously through her own hair. I'm sure I wasn't the only
one in that club to become mesmerised by the display. Faith's eyes
suddenly opened, capturing my unmitigated stare. A corner of her lips
curled up as she wrapped her hand around mine, maneuvering our bodies
closer together. We danced together, ignorant of all the guys that
had surrounded us. And I felt wild and free, like I could do anything
I wanted to do. Then I happened to look up and I saw Giles. Remember
that wild and free feeling? Gone.</p>

<p>I left Faith still dancing in her own world and headed up to the
second floor landing. As soon as I left, I noticed with a twinge of
anger that there was another guy all ready to take my place. That was
*my* place and I'd still be there if my Watcher hadn't chosen to show
up at such an inopportune moment. I couldn't help showing some of
that anger when I greeted him with a "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>He was taken aback but recovered. "Oh, I *really* want to be here,"
he said sarcastically. "This display of teenage hormones gone awry
and that noise you pass off as music..." He made a disgusted face.</p>

<p>"So tell me what you really think," I said drily, waiting for him
tell me what he was really doing there. </p>

<p>"This," he said, motioning to the floor below, "is a virtual hotbed
for vampiric activity. As the Slayer, you should be alert enough to
sense them, without looking, without thinking. Can you tell me how
many vampires there are down there?"</p>

<p>I glanced down at the dancefloor, trying to will my senses to reach
out. But it wasn't my Slayer senses that spotted the vamp. It was my
eyes that caught the glaring anachronism. "There," I said pointing
down to a guy who still dressed like it was the 80's. And he was
talking to Willow. I rushed down, ignoring Giles shouting after me
and waded through the crowd of dancers until I found Faith and pulled
her out. </p>

<p>"Willow just took off with a vamp," I said in her ear.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I was following Buffy towards the back door, cursing myself for
giving such fucked up advice. But it wasn't even the advice that was
bad, cause in any other town, you wouldn't be worrying about getting
picked up by a vamp. We were halfway to the door when skateboarder
guy, I think his name was Xander, walks up to us.</p>

<p>"Xander," Buffy said. "Do you have any idea where Willow could have
gone?"</p>

<p>"She's not here?" He asked, truly surprised.</p>

<p>"No, she took off with some guy."</p>

<p>"Wait, let me guess. Are you going to tell me he's a vampire?" He
asked with a smirk. I saw Buffy freeze at the question. Shaking out
of it, she dragged Xander out the back door.</p>

<p>Pushing Xander up against a wall as soon as we left the inside of the
Bronze, she asked, "Okay, who sent out the memo?" </p>

<p>"I overheard you and the librarian talking today," he said, smoothing
down his clothes. "Are you guys serious about that demon stuff?"</p>

<p>"I'm serious about finding Willow before she gets hurt," Buffy said,
impatiently. "So if you know where she could be, tell me...now." It
turned out that Xander didn't really know shit so we ended up just
going around to the nearest cemeteries, hoping we'd run into Red and
her vamp boytoy. Shit, if anything happens to her because of me and
my stupid mouth, I'm going to *so* fucking kick that vamp's ass. I
was still busy blaming myself and getting angrier the farther we
walked when I felt Buffy's hand on my arm.</p>

<p>I turned at her, ready to shake her off but she just looked at me in
that way she had as we kept walking and it was enough for the anger
to fade away. Then, all of a sudden, her head whipped around and she
took off through the cemetery we were walking through. I raced after
her with Xander at my heels and pretty soon, I spotted what had set
her off. Near some big tomb which was bigger than some bedrooms I've
slept in, Willow and another guy I didn't know were being pushed
around by two vampires. One girl and one guy. Buffy had already
leaped into the middle of the get together and was already kicking
some undead ass by the time we got there.</p>

<p>I pulled Willow away from the girl vamp and shoved Red back towards
Xander. I got in a quick punch at the blonde before she came back
sporting full game face and backhanded me in the jaw which hurt like
hell but I ignored the pain and dropped down to sweep her legs out
from under her. I got the stake out from the waistband of my pants ---
 still hadn't gotten that holster yet --- and climbed on top of her,
trying to push the stake down into her heart. Now you gotta
understand, a vampire's about as strong as ten men. So if they don't
want you to stab them in the heart, you're not gonna stab them in the
heart. But it never even came down to that cause something grabbed me
from behind and threw me into the side of a grave like I was a rag
doll. That something turned out to be this massive, ugly vamp who had
appeared out of nowhere. </p>

<p>He went right after Buffy and started beating her around, not as bad
as me but still... My shoulder was killing me where it'd hit against
the stone and I couldn't get up fast enough to back her up. Luckily,
Red distracted him enough so that Buffy started dishing out some pain
of her own. The vamps disappeared as soon as it looked like they were
gonna lose. </p>

<p>I walked over to the two of them as Xander made his own way
over. "Hey Red, you okay?" I asked, quickly looking her over for any
injuries.</p>

<p>"I'm fine," she said. Then, looking towards Buffy, she asked, "Did
that guy you were fighting with turn into dust?"</p>

<p>Buffy tried bullshitting her way out of it but she wasn't a very good
liar. So she ended up spilling the big Slayer secret which was
another bad, added on top of not having been able to stop those vamps
from taking off with that other guy.</p>

<p>"We have to tell Giles," Buffy said, her eyes falling to the
ground. "I have to tell him how the secret isn't so secret anymore.
Better he hear it from me."</p>

<p>We decided to tell him in the morning since it was really late
already and we had no idea where the man lived. We didn't really have
anything major to report anyway. The guy they'd taken was probably
vamp chow by now and that thing about the Harvest didn't seem like it
was going to happen tonight. So Xander ended up walking Willow home
while Buffy and me walked them halfway before we split up to go our
separate ways. </p>

<p>As we're walking down the street, Buffy wound her arm through mine
and asked, "Are you all right? I saw that vamp toss you pretty hard."</p>

<p>"Don't remind me," I groaned, painfully rotating my right shoulder.
And that was on top of the pain in my jaw from that wicked
backhand. "I think I'm going to need some serious icing tonight."</p>

<p>And then I heard her say something that totally confused the hell out
of me. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>I looked over at her but her head was down, staring at the
ground. "What? B, what are you sorry about? If it weren't for you, we
would've all been killed tonight." She was starting to shake her head
but before she could beat herself up anymore, I stopped her right
there in the middle of the street and tipped her chin up with my hand
so I could look her in the eyes. "Is this because of that guy?" She
bit her lip and then nodded ever so slightly. "You couldn't have done
anything more--"</p>

<p>"But I'm the Slayer," she said, interrupting me. "I should've been on
top of things, I should've been able to beat those vamps, I should've-
-"</p>

<p>"You should've been able to beat them back one handed and blindfolded
too, right?" I asked, interrupting her this time. "Hell, you're the
Slayer, you should've just shot laser beams from your eyes and
scorched them to death."</p>

<p>"I'm being serious," she said, bumping me in the stomach.</p>

<p>"I'm being serious too y'know," I said, bumping her right back. "You
can't save everybody, B. But I know you do your best every time you
go out there. So if you ask me, you have nothing to beat yourself up
about. We're going to find those vamps again and when we do, we're
going to dust them." I smiled at her and then added as an
afterthought, "But right now, I really do need that ice so d'ya think
we can go?"</p>

<p>Buffy let out a soft laugh as she took my arm again. "You always know
how to lift my sorry butt off the ground," she said, walking me down
the street again. "How do you do that?"</p>

<p>"It's a gift I don't like to flaunt in front of others," I said with
a smirk. Buffy laughed. I love the way she laughs. It always seems to
make me happier just hearing it. Especially if it's just her and me
like it is now. Nobody else but the two of us together. </p>

<p>When we got home, mom was kind of pissed cause we were a few minutes
late but I told her I fell down the stairs so she was all worried and
maternal after that and just thankful that I was all right. She went
to sleep a little afterwards and I was up in my bedroom reading a
gaming magazine when Buffy came in holding an ice pack.</p>

<p>"You're a goddess, B," I said, reaching for the pack. "Thanks." I
plopped it onto my shoulder and let out a soft hiss of relief. Buffy
crawled over me, lying down on her side next to me. She'd changed
into her cute pajamas with the rabbits on them and I couldn't help
checking out how nice she looked in the outfit.</p>

<p>"I hate that you get hurt like this," she said after a minute. </p>

<p>I smiled, turning my head to see her looking at me. "Hey, I chose to
do this, didn't I? And anyway, I'd feel ten times worse than this if
you're out there every night all by yourself without any backup. At
least I know that I'm doing everything I can to keep you safe."</p>

<p>She placed a hand on top of my belly, drawing imaginary designs with
her fingertips. "I just don't want anything to ever happen to you.
Not ever Faith."</p>

<p>"Nothing will," I said with all the confidence I could muster up at
twelve at night. "Cause you're there to watch my back, just like I'll
be watching yours."</p>

<p>She pulled closer to me, a contented smile floating across her
face. "Can I sleep with you tonight?" She asked. I was kinda
surprised that she'd want to but even more so cause the question was
being asked so shyly.</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah, sure B," I said grinning widely and trying to loosen her
up. "You know you can use me as your cuddly pillow anytime you like."</p>

<p>She grinned back and pulled herself even closer until she was almost
lying on top of me. I reached over and switched off the light,
adjusting the icepack on my shoulder so I wouldn't have to keep
holding onto it. Unlike the night before which seemed like it would
never end, on this night, I went to sleep with no problems at all and
the only time I woke up was when the alarm sounded the next morning.
I reached out an arm and slapped it on the clock until the annoying
ringing stopped. </p>

<p>I was just going to get up when I noticed that I couldn't. Buffy was
wrapped around me like a blanket and I just laid there for a minute,
enjoying how nice it was to be held like that. I finally let out a
sigh and began trying to unwrap myself which never works cause Buffy
just holds on tighter whenever I try. So eventually, I had to wake
her up. I'd wanted to give her a few extra minutes but the bathroom
was calling to me, especially the porcelain toilet god which everyone
worships at at one time or another.</p>

<p>After we got through the whole routine of getting up, washing,
changing, eating breakfast, and getting to school, the first thing we
did was head towards the library. Xander and Red were already there,
trying to grill the G-man into giving them some information and, by
the looks of it, they weren't getting much out of the old guy.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Giles," Buffy said. "They know what's going
on...They were sort of with me last night when I staked a vamp and
Xander overheard us yesterday when we were talking about the Slayer
thing so I don't think trying to hide it from them now is going to
work too well." I swore I could see G-man break out into a sweat at
those words but Buffy wasn't even done yet. "And the vamps took
someone with them...before I could stop them." </p>

<p>"Did you see where they went?" Giles asked, looking around at
everybody.</p>

<p>I shook my head, "No, they just kinda disappeared. One second they're
there. And then, gone."</p>

<p>"I'm guessing they went underground," Buffy said. "They didn't run or
we would've seen them. And I didn't hear a car."</p>

<p>Xander started frowning in confusion. "I thought vampires flew ---
you know, in movies, they do this whole turning into a bat thing..."</p>

<p>"No," Giles answered shortly. But before he could launch into some
long winded lecture on vampire misconceptions in popular culture,
Buffy cut him off.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about the Harvest?" When Giles just stared at
her all confused, she impatiently explained what the 'special'
vampire from last night had told her. "He said we had to prepare for
the Harvest. Do you think the vamps I fought yesterday had anything
to do with it? They were both really strong. Much stronger than your
average newbie." </p>

<p>Before Buffy had even finished the last sentence, Giles was already
pulling books out and laying them down in front of her. One after
another after another. These weren't just ordinary books either,
these things were books on steroids. I felt kinda sorry for Buffy
cause her jaw was practically on the floor when Giles said she was
supposed to look through them and try picking out the vamps from last
night. Mug shots of a who's who going back hundreds of years.</p>

<p>"Faith, what are you doing?" She asks when I sit down and start
leafing through the first book.</p>

<p>I smirk at the puzzled expression on her face. "B, you weren't the
only one to see those vamps last night." She gave me that soft smile
and I knew that it was going to be worth the pain of two blurred
eyes. Red and Xander took their own cues and sat down too, each
taking a book without a word. G-man went into his stacks, muttering
something about finding out about the Harvest.</p>

<p>It was about an hour later while I was rubbing my eyes for the
twentieth time that Buffy finally spotted one of the vamps from the
run-in. Turns out that the girl's named Darla and, get this, she's a
couple hundred years old. Now that's what I call well-preserved. So
like Buffy suspected, these weren't lightweights we were messing
around with. </p>

<p>When Buffy and me left the library with Xander, Willow and Giles were
each in their own worlds. Giles was nose deep in his books and Red
was on the computer, each trying to find out as much as they could
about the Harvest. So far, not much. And they figured out fast enough
that the three of us weren't made for sitting still and doing the
research thing so we'd been sent off to class. The trade-off was
pretty much even if you asked me. </p>

<p>"This is great y'know," Xander said with a grin. "In some small way,
I'm helping to save people from demons and vampires and--"</p>

<p>"And you want to announce that to the whole school?" Buffy asked,
smirking. We were walking down an empty hallway but you could never
tell who was listening. Xander should know about that more than
anybody. </p>

<p>"Sorry," he said with a sheepish grin. "But it's just so cool."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're enjoying yourself so much." Buffy stopped and looked
at him, a serious expression entering her face. "But Xander, remember
what we're dealing with here. They're dangerous creatures and if
you're even an inch off your game, you're going to die...And you
don't deal with them, I deal with them. I'm the Slayer."</p>

<p>"Yeah but, I'm sure even Slayers need help." He glanced quickly over
at me and I knew what he was thinking. How come I get to help and
Buffy doesn't jump all over me about it. So before anybody could say
anything, I wrapped an arm around Buffy's shoulders. </p>

<p>"Don't sweat it X. B knows that If she tried to leave me behind, I'd
just go after her anyway." I smiled over at Buffy who had this
exasperated look on her face. "Isn't that right, B?" She just pushed
off of me, walking ahead and shaking her head. </p>

<p>"Are you sure you're sisters?" I heard Xander asking as I walked
after Buffy.</p>
