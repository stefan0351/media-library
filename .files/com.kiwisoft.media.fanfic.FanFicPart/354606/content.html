<!-- Coming To An Agreement \ Conclusion -->

<p>Tuesday morning B'Elanna was back in engineering. She was up-dating herself with everything that had gone on during her recuperation. All systems were operating at peak efficiency since the retrofit at the station, but she still wasn't happy. The feelings she had developed for Seven of Nine left her feeling confused. </p>
<p>The sudden attraction and desire for the blond had surprised her. Much of her past antagonism for the ex-drone had been born of the belief that Seven had no Human emotions. She had thought Seven was unfeeling and arrogant. </p>
<p>After everything that happened recently, she realized she had been wrong. She kept remembering the wealth of emotion in Seven's voice when she had said B'Elanna's name in that cargo bay. She remembered the warmth of the arms wrapped around her, protecting her. She had thought Seven had feelings for her, romantic feelings. Now she wasn't so sure.</p>
<p>The engineer's eyes were distant as she sat at her desk contemplating that morning's staff meeting.</p>
<p>She had been looking forward to seeing Seven of Nine. She hadn't seen the young woman for almost a week and had missed her. Unfortunately, it didn't seem as though the feeling was mutual.</p>
<p>Seven hadn't looked at her once during the entire meeting. She had little to say and for the most part stared at the conference table in front of her.</p>
<p>After the meeting, B'Elanna had tried to engage the young woman in conversation. Seven made some comment about adjusting the long range sensors and left B'Elanna gaping at her like a terran fish.</p>
<p>&#034;Uughhh.&#034; She growled and got out of her chair. Maybe she could find something to do in main engineering to take her mind off the shapely Borg.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, trying to force her irritation into the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>B'Elanna strode into engineering to see the object of her desire running calculations at console four. She headed in that direction. Maybe if she couldn't get Seven into a personal conversation she could talk about work. Anything to be able to look into those ice blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#034;Hey, Seven.&#034; she said with forced cheer.</p>
<p>Seven started and looked up abruptly while entering a string of commands into the computer.</p>
<p>&#034;Warning, warp core breech imminent.&#034; came the feminine voice of the computer.</p>
<p>&#034;What the hell are you doing?&#034; B'Elanna shouted.</p>
<p>Seven quickly overrode the core breech and input the corrected string of alpha numerics.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's temper had already been riding the edge and this was the last straw.</p>
<p>She stalked over to the Borg and placed her fisted hands on her hips. </p>
<p>&#034;For someone whose father was a Borg drone and her mother a maturation chamber, I'd expect you to be more intelligent than making a stupid mistake like that.&#034; She growled.</p>
<p>She could have bit her tongue off at the root when she saw Seven's head snap back at the insult. Then the soft blue eyes filled with tears. Seven turned without a word and left engineering.</p>
<p>&#034;Damn. I'm such a p'taq.&#034; B'Elanna murmured, surprised at the blonde's reaction. She had never seen such a display of emotion from the woman and felt about two centimeters tall.</p>
<p>She hadn't really been angry with Seven. She was just frustrated. Frustrated for wanting the taller woman so badly, and lacking the courage to do anything about it.</p>
<p>B'Elanna knew she had to apologize. She would never be able to look herself in the mirror until she did. Even still, she knew the ache in those eyes would haunt her the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Quickly, she checked the console and made sure they wouldn't lose the warp core.</p>
<p>&#034;Vorik,&#034; she called to the young Vulcan engineer. &#034;cover for me, will ya. There's something I need to take care of.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;May I remind you, lieutenant, your duty shift ends in approximately ten minutes. I will cover for you in the interim.&#034; He stated politely.</p>
<p>&#034;Thanks, Vorik.&#034; She smiled. &#034;I owe you one.&#034;</p>
<p>As soon as she walked into the corridor she said, &#034;Computer, locate Seven of Nine.&#034;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>Seven couldn't believe the tightness and pain in her chest. After everything that had happened, she couldn't believe B'Elanna would speak to her like that.</p>
<p>Leaving engineering, she took the turbolift to deck fifteen. It was the lowest deck on the ship. Seven walked down a small, rarely used corridor that was used to access a maintenance hatch. Being in so remote a location on the ship, it was rare to find anyone here. </p>
<p>She needed to be alone. Anyone could walk into the cargo bay or the Astrometrics lab so she couldn't go there.</p>
<p>Tears coursed freely down her cheeks as she walked unsteadily to the maintenance hatch. She forced the hatch open and squeezed into the tight space. There was enough room for her to crawl in on her knees. Seven turned and sat with her back against the hull, knees drawn up. Her head rested on her knees and her shoulders shook with the sobs.</p>
<p>She seemed to always be crying lately. Sorrow seemed to be the only Human emotion she could feel. </p>
<p>The Borg heard a slight noise and looked up. B'Elanna was climbing into the maintenance hatch. Seven turned her face away; not able to bear the sight of the face she loved so dearly.</p>
<p>&#034;Lieutenant Torres.&#034; She said, &#034;Why did you follow me? I apologize if I left before you could finish insulting me.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna flinched. Deserved that one, she thought.</p>
<p>The darker woman crawled over next to Seven. She could feel the heat radiating off the woman and could smell her clean, sweet scent. Her heartbeat seemed to speed up of it's own accord and her nostrils flared.</p>
<p>Dammit, she chastised herself, Klingon bloodlust. She took a calming breath.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven,&#034; she began gently, &#034;I'm sorry. I was way out of line. I didn't mean what I said.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Then why did you say it?&#034; she asked without looking at B'Elanna.</p>
<p>&#034;You don't make this easy, do you?&#034;</p>
<p>Seven finally turned toward her and B'Elanna felt her heart ache to see the tracks of tears.</p>
<p>&#034;Is there some reason I should make this easy?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No. I guess not.&#034; B'Elanna admitted.</p>
<p>&#034;Look, Seven</p>
<p>&#034;Don't worry, lieutenant. I understand this is not the first time you have insulted me. I cannot explain my lack of self-control. I'm sure I will 'get over it'&#034;.</p>
<p>&#034;Stop it, will ya? You shouldn't have to get over it. I shouldn't talk to you like that. No one should.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna hesitated as she realized Seven had a point. They had argued on countless occasions. Why was it suddenly so upsetting for the ex-drone? </p>
<p>The caramel colored engineer deliberately took Seven's mesh encased left hand between her own, deciding it was time to work out their differences. The metal was surprisingly warm and briefly distracted B'Elanna from what she meant to say.</p>
<p>&#034;SevenI have a confession to make.&#034;</p>
<p>The Borg was very interested in what could make the gruff woman's voice so gentle.</p>
<p>&#034;This is hard for me to say.&#034; She began by forcing herself to look deeply into Seven's eyes. &#034;I find I've been having feelings lately. Feelings I don't really understand.&#034; She paused for a moment.</p>
<p>&#034;Actually, that's not true. I do understand the feelings, I just don't know what to do about them.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Lieutenant, I do not understand.&#034; Seven admitted breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elannaplease call me B'Elanna. You did on the station. I remember that.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna&#034; she enjoyed saying the name, the way it felt on her tongue.</p>
<p>&#034;What I mean, Seven, is that I care for you. Very much. I just don't know what to do about it. You know I'm involved with Tom, Seven.&#034; </p>
<p>Gently, Seven placed her right hand against B'Elanna's soft cheek, gasping slightly at the warmth.</p>
<p>&#034;What are you saying?&#034; she asked softly.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm saying I'm attracted to you. I care for you and don't want to hurt you. But a purely physical relationship isn't what I want. I've had that in the past, and I don't want to have it in the future.&#034;</p>
<p> &#034;What I feel for you is not 'purely physical'. I love you.&#034; Seven whispered desperately, feeling the tears slide down her cheeks. &#034;I love you, so much.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven&#034; she gasped tears stinging the backs of her own eyes. &#034;Seven you don't know that. Have you ever felt these kinds of feelings before?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No.&#034; The young woman admitted reluctantly. &#034;But I believe I know how I feel now.&#034;</p>
<p>Slowly B'Elanna leaned toward the gorgeous blond. Seven felt her eyes closing against her will. Soft lips caressed her own. Seven had never been kissed before. She felt warmed and comforted by the soft pressure. B'Elanna's strong, soft tongue stroked her lower lip. Seven gasped in surprise and the tongue took advantage of the parting lips to slip inside and past her teeth exploring her mouth with authority. </p>
<p>B'Elanna enjoyed the sensation of the full lips against her own, even as she knew she shouldn't. She pulled away, gently disentangling herself from the strong arms.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven. I can't do this. I owe Tom the respect of being faithful to him.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Do you not love me?&#034; She asked wrenchingly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna searched the yearning face and knew she couldn't lie.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, Seven. I do.&#034;</p>
<p>To Seven's amazement, B'Elanna's eyes became heavy-lidded with desire and she reached up to gently stroke the pale cheek. Seven pulled B'Elanna against her chest and into another kiss. She thought the Klingon tasted wonderful and Seven knew she would never get enough of kissing her.</p>
<p>Their mouths parted only so they could suck in another breath then resumed consuming each other. Seven pulled the other woman onto her lap so that B'Elanna was straddling her. B'Elanna broke the kiss panting for breath, and felt the Borg nuzzling her hair.</p>
<p>&#034;I love you.&#034; Seven repeated into the delicate ear.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven&#034; she gasped, tears stinging the backs of her eyes.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pulled back to look into twin pools she could lose her soul in.</p>
<p>&#034;Darling, I love you, too. But I want to go slowly and do this right. That means I have something I need to deal with.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You are referring to Lieutenant Paris.&#034; </p>
<p>&#034;Yes. Until I can settle things with Tom, I can't allow things to escalate between us.&#034; She said.</p>
<p>&#034;Explain.&#034; Seven demanded with a touch of her typical arrogance. &#034;I love you. You love me. Is that not enough?&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna chuckled. Sometimes the younger woman had a way of seeing straight to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>&#034;Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Honor demands that I end things properly with him.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You mean you would end your relationship with Lt. Paris so that we could be together?&#034; she reasoned.</p>
<p>The Klingon sighed trying to think of the words to make Seven understand.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, my personal beliefs would never allow me to break up with someone just so I could be with someone else. If he and I were both full Klingons that would mean one of us would have to die. And we don't want that.&#034; She added sardonically.</p>
<p>&#034;Indeed.&#034; Seven agreed with a note of distress.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, things have been over with Tom for a long time. He even dates other women. This is about something else. This is about me wanting to have a clean start with you. With no baggage or anything hanging over our heads. This is about me wanting to do the honorable thing, for once. Can you understand?&#034; </p>
<p>&#034;I believe so.&#034; Seven stated gently. &#034;Now that I know you love me, I will wait patiently. I will do what I can to assist you in remaining honorable. When will you speak with him?&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna lost track of the conversation as she stared into the pale blue eyes of her love. She watched them darken to a cobalt blue with sudden desire and found herself closing the distance between them. </p>
<p>She stopped just before making contact with the wonderful soft lips. &#034;What?&#034; she breathed softly into Seven's mouth, feeling disoriented.</p>
<p>Seven swallowed convulsively, trying to concentrate. &#034;When will you speak with Lieutenant Paris?&#034; She almost didn't recognize the voice husky with desire as her own.</p>
<p>The small engineer pulled back with considerable effort.</p>
<p>&#034;Tonight.&#034; She said. &#034;I'm having dinner with him at Sandrine's.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Would you like me to be there?&#034; Seven offered.</p>
<p>B'Elanna grinned at the image those words conjured up. &#034;I'm not sure he'd appreciate it if you just showed up with me for dinner, love.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven felt a thrill course through her at the endearment, but would not be distracted, again.</p>
<p>&#034;I did not mean to join you. I only meant to be inside Sandrine's, should you need me.&#034; She explained.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm just teasing you, darling. But, seriously, I don't think it's a good idea. I appreciate that you want to be there to support me. But this is something I need to do on my own.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Very well.&#034; Seven agreed reluctantly. &#034;But you will tell me as soon as you are finished with your discussion.&#034; She demanded.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, dear.&#034; B'Elanna joked, kissing her tenderly.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>Tom waited patiently for the Klingon to join him. He had reserved their favorite table in a dimly lit corner and had his plan all worked out. He didn't think B'Elanna would object.</p>
<p>While waiting for his dinner companion, the helmsman thought about the staff meeting earlier that morning. He had been wondering who might have caught the feisty woman's attention. When Seven had entered the conference room, his question had been answered.</p>
<p>To say he had been surprised would have been an understatement. But the flush that had crept up her neck and face had not been his imagination. She couldn't seem to tear her eyes from the lanky young blond. She had been painfully obvious in her attempt to not stare at the ex-drone, but her eyes kept returning to caress the Nordic features.</p>
<p>Tom couldn't remember B'Elanna ever looking at him that way. He had seen anger and passion, but he had never seen that look of softly aching desire directed at him. </p>
<p>He had held the opportunity for utter bliss in his hands and tossed it into the wind.</p>
<p>He knew this was the right thing to do. If he could do this right, maybe someday, she would forgive him for all the immaturity he had displayed throughout this relationship. </p>
<p>Tom glanced over as the door to Sandrine's opened. He smiled and stood, gallantly holding the chair out for the olive-skinned woman.</p>
<p>He saw the brief frown mar her brow and knew she was wondering what he was up to.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna, you're looking lovely.&#034; </p>
<p>She had worn a midnight colored gown that barely reached mid-thigh. The elegant cut left her back and upper arms bare.</p>
<p>&#034;Thank you.&#034; She said carefully. &#034;You look nice, too.&#034;</p>
<p>The young man had made a concentrated effort to look nice and wore a navy blazer with a white silk shirt and tan slacks. B'Elanna wondered about his motives. He rarely dressed for dinner and always under duress.</p>
<p>&#034;What's the occasion?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;What,&#034; he asked with feigned innocence, &#034;can't a guy try to impress you?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Sure,&#034; she retorted, not buying that answer for a nano-second, &#034;but you're not that guy.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Ouch.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Look, Tom. Let's just have dinner and get it over with.&#034; She growled.</p>
<p>Tom took a deep breath and gathered his resolve. He knew it was better to do it now and get it over with. As the waiter approached, the young man waved him away.</p>
<p>&#034;Let's talk for a minute before we order, okay.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Okay, maybe I should go first.&#034; B'Elanna offered trying to figure out how to start.</p>
<p>Somehow, he knew he couldn't let her go first. Tom knew she would try to tell him about Seven and he knew her Klingon honor would be compromised. After all he had put her through, and all the second chances she had given him when he had pulled some stunt or ignored her for a car or new ship, he owed her this one. And if she never knew the truth, so much the better.</p>
<p>&#034;Wait, B'Elanna. I really need to go first this time.&#034; He said softly.</p>
<p>She could see the sincerity in his eyes and acquiesced with a small nod.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna, I've been thinking about our conversation from last night. You were right when you said the open relationship was unfair. Please, hear me out.&#034; He said when she would have argued.</p>
<p>&#034;I tried to convince you that things could be the way they were before. But, they can't. You know I've been seeing other women.&#034;&nbsp; </p>
<p>His eyes focused on the tabletop. He couldn't lie to her and look her in the face.</p>
<p>&#034;There's someonein particular. I really care for her Lanna, and I want to spend time with her. Exclusively.&nbsp; I hope you understand.&#034; He finished, finally looking up to gauge her reaction.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was for once speechless.&nbsp; It was so perfect. Communication and honesty were paramount for successful human relationships. Klingon sensibilities demanded exclusivity. By Tom telling her he was interested in someone else, she was free to date whomever she chose.</p>
<p>&#034;Tom, are you sure? You're not going to change your mind?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I'm sure B'Elanna. It's better this way. Now if you're ready to order&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna finished her dinner with little enthusiasm. Now that things were settled with Tom, all she wanted was to see Seven of Nine. </p>
<p>As soon as the door to Sandrine's closed behind her she queried the computer and discovered Seven was regenerating in her alcove. </p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>That's all right, she thought. I'll just watch her sleep. Captain Janeway does it all the time and she's not even her lover.</p>
<p>Just the thought of that word sent a shiver of anticipation through her. All the feelings of desire she had been suppressing came rushing to the top and suddenly she didn't know if she could wait for the blond to wake up. B'Elanna felt a growl rumbling in her chest. She increased speed to the cargo bay, fairly rushing through the doors as they opened wide enough to allow entrance. She froze at the sight of the beauty locked in sleep inside the regeneration alcove. </p>
<p>Slowly, she reminded herself. She wanted to enjoy every new experience with the woman she knew was her soulmate.&nbsp; She took the time to study the narrow features, the implants gracing her left brow and right cheek. Her hair, the color of spun gold and sunshine. Her hands, long fingered and sensual even with the Borg mesh on the left. Her body: long, lean, powerful and sensual.</p>
<p>B'Elanna checked the console and discovered there was only an hour left in the regeneration cycle. Obviously Seven had set the controls for a short cycle so she could find out the results of the Klingon's dinner. </p>
<p>The compact engineer settled gracefully at Seven's feet, leaning her head back to rest against the braced legs. She closed her eyes to rest briefly, waiting for the cycle to end.</p>
<p>Sometime later, she felt movement behind her.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna?&#034; came a groggy voice.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm here.&#034; She answered, standing and moving so the blond could step away from the alcove.</p>
<p>Her arms encircled the slim waist as her head came to rest against a strong shoulder. B'Elanna smiled as she felt Seven's arms enfold her.</p>
<p>&#034;How was your dinner?&#034; Seven asked politely while nuzzling the thick dark hair at the engineer's temple.</p>
<p>&#034;Better than expected.&#034; She answered honestly. &#034;Tom told me he wants to see someone else.&#034;</p>
<p>The Borg took a moment to work through the social implications of both human and Klingon customs before reaching a conclusion. She released a breath she didn't realize she had been holding.</p>
<p>&#034;We are free to be together.&#034; She said in a soft happy voice.</p>
<p>B'Elanna brushed her lips over the soft cheek and whispered, &#034;Yes, and I want to be together. Now.&#034;</p>
<p>She pulled back and grasped Seven's hands. &#034;Would you like to come to my quarters so we can talk?&#034; she asked teasingly.</p>
<p>&#034;Somehow,&#034; Seven said with a hint of humor in her eyes. &#034;I do not believe talking was what you had in mind.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No.&#034; B'Elanna confirmed. &#034;But, we will be vocalizing a great deal.&#034; </p>
<p>The feral smile she bestowed sent a chill up Seven's spine. &#034;Indeed. I will comply.&#034; She said huskily.</p>
<p>B'Elanna chuckled as she took Seven's hand and led her from the cargo bay. She didn't release her hold as they walked through the ship, and she pointedly ignored the startled glances and outright stares of the crew.</p>
<p>When they reached the chief engineer's quarters, talking was the last thing on their minds. Seven felt as though she had wanted and waited forever to hold this woman in her arms.</p>
<p>She turned toward B'Elanna, placed her hands on the broad shoulders and gently kissed her. Trying to absorb all of the tastes and textures of this small woman.</p>
<p>B'Elanna instinctively parted her lips, inviting the soft tongue inside. Seven groaned as she felt B'Elanna's strong hands grasping her gluteus maximus.</p>
<p>The Klingon grasped the blond head between her hands, deepening the kiss. Seven bent without losing contact with the soft lips. Although the Klingon hybrid had a denser skeletal structure than a human, it was no match for the Borg enhanced strength. Seven lifted her easily and walked into the bedroom. She sat B'Elanna on the edge of the bed and finally drew away from the kiss.</p>
<p>&#034;I want to see you.&#034; She whispered.</p>
<p>B'Elanna shuddered and looked into eyes colored cobalt with desire. The women slowly shed each other of their clothing. Seven eased B'Elanna back until she was lying on the bed. Seven lowered her tall body over the smaller woman, resting most of her weight on her elbows. She trailed her lips down the rich brown neck and down the swell of the small, upturned breasts. Her tongue darted out and swirled around a nipple. </p>
<p>B'Elanna gasped in pleased surprise. Seven planted small kisses across the chest to the other nipple while she continued to fondle and pinch the one she had just been teasing.</p>
<p>Sensation was tearing through B'Elanna's body. No one had made her feel like this before. She was having difficulty holding a coherent thought. Her breath was coming in harsh gasps.</p>
<p>Seven was planting teasing touches down the soft pliant body. She followed her fingers with her mouth, licking and kissing what she had been touching. Her tongue teased the inside of the small indent on the muscled abdomen as her fingers gently stroked the soft inner thighs.</p>
<p>Seven's leg slipped between the thighs and B'Elanna felt the scorching blast of sharp desire. She arched toward the Borg's creamy white leg, painting it with moisture.</p>
<p>The powerful blond slipped lower, spreading the legs apart and lying between them. She used her human hand to spread the brown hair away from the warm opening and sought between the folds with her tongue.</p>
<p>B'Elanna cried out sharply with the contact of the wet muscle. She couldn't prevent her hips from moving, thrusting toward the insistent tongue.</p>
<p>Seven inhaled deeply, savoring the flavor of the woman. She had done vast research on same sex copulation, but nothing could have prepared her for this perfection. She could stay here forever.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's breath was starting to come in uneven gasps and her thrusting had increased in speed. Seven knew she was craving release. She eased two fingers of her mesh encased left hand into the opening.</p>
<p>The engineer's eyes flew open as she realized what the young woman was doing. It was incredible. B'Elanna could feel the ripples in the mesh rubbing gently inside her.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven&#034; she panted, &#034;faster.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven felt a thrill of pleasure shoot through her at the sound of her lover's voice. She increased the speed of her thrusting into B'Elanna and pressed down harder on the clit with her tongue.</p>
<p>B'Elanna blew with the force of a volcano. She grasped hold of both of Seven's upper arms for support and all of deck nine, section twelve knew she was engaging in &#034;intimate relations.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven sighed and nuzzled gently between the soft thighs. She loved the unique flavor of the strong woman. She slid up and snuggled into B'Elanna's arms.</p>
<p>&#034;Gods, you're incredible.&#034; B'Elanna declared when she could breath again.</p>
<p>Seven began placing light kisses along her jawbone.</p>
<p>&#034;Oh, no you don't.&#034; The engineer said.</p>
<p>Seven was amazed at the ease with which the smaller woman flipped her onto her back.</p>
<p>&#034;It's my turn.&#034; She looked intently into Seven's eyes. &#034;I'm going to go slow. I want this to be special for you.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;It is special.&#034; Seven assured her. &#034;You are here, and I am here. It will always be special.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna returned her attention to the full Borg lips. &#034;I love you.&#034; She breathed against them.</p>
<p>Seven lost all coherent thought as the young Klingon showed her exactly how much she meant those words.</p>
