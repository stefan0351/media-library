<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part Six -->

<p>"Brooke! Brooke get up, you?re going to be late!"</p>
<p>Brooke awoke to Jane?s banging on her bedroom door ad sleepily looked at her alarm clock. The time blinked at her in red numbers. 0:00</p>
<p>"Oh shit!" The cheerleader muttered as she jumped out of bed. "I?m up Jane!" She called, hoping to stop the stressed out woman pounding on her door.</p>
<p>"Hurry up! We?re all late." Jane called. Brooke heard her footsteps descend the stairs very rapidly. The blonde grabbed some clothes from her cupboard and rushed into the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Sam yelled in surprise as Brooke bumped into her from behind. The collision caused the brunette to drop the towel she was holding, revealing her naked form to the blonde girl in front of her.</p>
<p>"Uh...I...I...Uh..." Brooke stuttered. Sam was breathtaking. Literally. Seeing her like this was nothing short of an epiphany. The cheerleader felt her own gaze wander shamelessly across Sam?s body, taking in every inch of smooth, tanned skin. Memorizing the way her long, wet brown hair hung loose down her body, partially concealing her pert breasts. She almost looked like a mermaid, only the tail was missing. Those long legs were a great substitute though.</p>
<p>"Do you mind?!" The brunette yelled, yanking the towel from the floor and covering herself. Brooke felt an immediate blush rise to her cheeks as she tore her gaze away from Sam.</p>
<p>"Sorry." She whispered. "I...Sorry."</p>
<p>Sam pushed Brooke back out of the bathroom and slammed the door closed behind her. The brunette leaned against the doorframe, panting. Wait a minute, why was she panting? It?s not like it took much physical strength to push Brooke out of bathroom, she wasn?t that heavy. Sam had discovered that last night.</p>
<p>** "Brooke?" Sam looked at the blonde. Seemingly, she was still very concentrated on her Geography book. "Brooke? Hello?" Sam reached out and shook the blonde gently. The cheerleader slowly fell forward, landing with her head in the brunette?s lap. Her mouth was slightly opened and her breathing was slow and steady. She was asleep.</p>
<p>Sam giggled a little. Brooke looked kinda cute like that.</p>
<p>"Ok princess." The brunette smiled. "Time for beddie-bye." She cautiously slid the sleeping girl?s head off her thigh and crawled off the bed. Removing the books, she then reached out and lifted the blonde up, placing her head in the proper end of the bed. Sam pulled back the covers and tugged Brooke in. The cheerleader soon curled up in the fetal position with a content smile playing at her lips. Sam simply couldn?t resist the urge to give Brooke a light peck on the forehead before she left the room. **</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke asked as she knocked the brunette?s bedroom door softly. "Are you...I mean...Uh, decent?"</p>
<p>"It?s 5 in the afternoon, what do you think?" Came the brunette?s voice from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>"Right, sorry." Brooke shook her head. That had been a stupid question. "Um, can I come in?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Brooke slowly opened the door and peeked inside, wanting to make sure that Sam actually was fully dressed. She saw the brunette sitting on the floor in the middle of the room, papers, pencils, notes and various other objects scattered all around her. A pencil was pushed behind the brunette?s left ear, keeping her hands free to hold up the piece of paper she was reading.</p>
<p>"Hey." Brooke said shyly as she sat down on the floor in front of the brunette.</p>
<p>"Hey." Sam replied, still looking at the paper.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Working on an article." Sam pulled the pencil out from behind her ear and chewed on it lightly.</p>
<p>"Listen, I wanted to talk to you." Brooke said, trying to look the reporter in the eyes, but Sam avoided her gaze every time.</p>
<p>"?Bout what?" The brunette replied, putting own the paper and studying her hands.</p>
<p>"About this morning." Brooke blushed slightly. "I am really sorry I barged in on you like that."</p>
<p>"It?s ok Brooke, really." Sam said.</p>
<p>"Then why won?t you look me in the eyes?" Sam blushed fiercely and bowed her head further down, letting her long hair conceal her face.</p>
<p>"Come on Sam, I mean, it?s not like you have anything to be ashamed of." Brooke immediately brought a hand to her forehead with a loud slap. "Oh God! That did SO not come out right! No wait, I mean that... not that I was looking at you or anything... I just think...I think I?m heading into full-fledged babble-mode here, aren?t I?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much, yeah." Sam snickered from behind the brown curtain.</p>
<p>Brooke giggled a little. "This is REALLY awkward, isn?t it?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh." Sam responded, lifting her head a little. "But, we are going to be step-sisters soon. This is probably not the last time that will happen."</p>
<p>"You might have a point there." Brooke nodded thoughtfully. "And if it?ll make you feel any better, I hereby grant you my full consent to walk in on me in the shower anytime you should feel like it."</p>
<p>Sam quirked an eyebrow and looked at the cheerleader through her eyelashes. "Come again?"</p>
<p>"Uh..." Brooke sent the brunette a sheepish grin. "I don?t seem to have a way with words today."</p>
<p>"Can?t argue with that." Sam stated.</p>
<p>"What I meant was this; I like it when we?re not fighting, and I really don?t want to screw this one up. I saw you naked by accident, and if you doing the same thing, purposely or not, is what will keep things the way they are, then I?ll have to agree to it."</p>
<p>"Better watch what you?re saying." Sam smirked as she finally looked Brooke fully in the eyes. "I might just take you up on that offer."</p>
