<!-- Accidental Love \ Part 11 -->

<p>The clock read just past six when the call of nature pulled Rose from her slumber.
			Sleepy green eyes opened and focused on the woman sleeping beneath her. It took a few
			minutes to extricate herself from the human puzzle they had formed during the night. After
			a quick trip to the bathroom, Rose positioned her crutches and went to the kitchen to
			start a pot of coffee. She was pouring the steaming liquid into two mugs by the time
			Ronnie padded into the room. "Good morning. I thought you'd like some coffee."</p>
		<p>"Mmm, yes thanks." The tall woman walked over and wrapped her arms around
			Rose from behind. "Good morning, Hon." She pressed her lips to the top of the
			young woman's head. "I've got to pick up Mother in a couple of hours."</p>
		<p>"Then you definitely need your coffee," Rose said, handing over the two mugs.
			"And if you're going to kiss me good morning, do it right."</p>
		<p>Ronnie shook her head. "Mmm, morning breath. No kisses until after I brush my
			teeth."</p>
		<p>"I'll take my chances."</p>
		<p>"Really?" An eyebrow raised slightly as she set the mugs down. Turning
			around, she took first one crutch, then the other, and put them to the side before
			gathering Rose in her arms. "So you want a good morning kiss, hmm?" She lowered
			her head and poured all of her love into a series of soft kisses. She nipped and coaxed
			with her lips until she felt Rose's mouth open for her. Ronnie swallowed soft moans as her
			tongue explored the inside of the young woman's mouth.
			<i>Oh yeah, you like that, don't
				you? </i>To her utter surprise she felt a very insistent tongue pushing into her own
			mouth. Now it was the executive's turn to moan. When they broke apart, it was several
			seconds before their breathing returned to a manageable level. "How's that?" she
			asked in a husky voice. "Does that meet with your approval for a morning kiss, Miss
			Grayson?"
		</p>
		<p>"Oh yes, very nice." Rose leaned up for another quick brushing of lips before
			reaching for her crutches.
			<i>Kiss me like that every morning and I'll be happy forever. </i>She
			reluctantly pulled back, her whole body screaming for more contact. "You had better
			drink your coffee before it gets cold."
		</p>
		<p>Ronnie looked at the clock. "I would much rather spend the day with you, you
			know." A shrill beeping drew a frown from the executive. "I'll get it. With my
			luck it's probably Susan trying to duck out of dealing with Mother today." She picked
			up the phone. "Cartwright Residence?Yeah, good morning to you too, Sis. What's
			up?" Rose watched as dark eyebrows furrowed in puzzlement. "Mm hmm, she's
			awake?no, we just got up and were having coffee." Now the brows shot up and blue
			eyes locked with green. "Well?sure, that sounds fine to me. Let me ask her, hold
			on." Ronnie held the phone to her chest. "Susan wants to know if you'd like to
			go out for breakfast."</p>
		<p>"Uh, sure." It would be the first time she had gone out of the house with the
			exception of her doctor's appointments and the funeral. She watched a beaming smile come
			over Ronnie's face.</p>
		<p>"Sure, sounds good, Susan." They finalized arrangements while Rose sipped her
			coffee. By the time Ronnie hung up the phone, her own coffee had cooled enough to drink in
			four long gulps. "We should get going here. We're supposed to meet there in
			forty-five minutes. I'll run upstairs and get ready." She picked up Rose's now empty
			cup and set it with hers in the sink. "Do me a favor?"</p>
		<p>"Anything," the young woman replied.</p>
		<p>"Wear that rust colored shirt?" A shy smile came to Ronnie's lips. "I
			think you look really nice in it."</p>
		<p>"I don't think any of the skirts go with it."</p>
		<p>"The khaki pants do. I'm sure the leg is wide enough to get over the cast."</p>
		<p>Rose smiled. When she had opened those clothes on Christmas she had thought then they
			would go well together. She also knew Ronnie had a weakness for that particular shirt.
			"Sure, but it'll cost you."</p>
		<p>"Cost me?" Puzzlement turned to amusement when she saw the calculating grin.</p>
		<p>"You have to wear that gray cotton shirt and those black jeans."</p>
		<p>"The baggy ones or the tight ones?"</p>
		<p>"The tight ones." Rose realized how it could be taken and blushed. "I
			just think they look good on you," she mumbled, looking away as her ears turned an
			even brighter shade of red.</p>
		<p>"Uh huh," Ronnie smirked. "You're cute when you blush, you know
			that."</p>
		<p>"You've told me that before."</p>
		<p>"It's still true." She walked over to the table and knelt down until she was
			eye level with the young woman. "Actually, the truth is, you're beautiful anytime.
			With or without a blush." She leaned in and gave Rose a peck on the cheek. "Come
			on, I'm starving."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Can I get you ladies something to drink to start off?" the waitress asked.
			The three women were sitting in a booth, Susan sat alone on one side. Rose opened her
			mouth but before she could utter a sound, Ronnie spoke. "Coffees on this side and
			she'll have tea?lemon, no cream. We'll be ready to order when you return."</p>
		<p>"I'll be right back with your drinks."</p>
		<p>"Do you know what you want?" the executive asked without looking up from her
			menu. It took a gentle nudge under the table for Rose to figure out the question was
			directed at her.</p>
		<p>"Um?" She scanned the menu, noting with great alarm the prices that ran
			down the right hand side.
			<i>Six-fifty for two eggs and toast? Two ninety-five for coffee?
			</i>Her appetite shrank in direct proportion to the prices. "I don't think I'm really
			all that hungry. Maybe just a muffin and coffee."
		</p>
		<p>"Oh no, Rose," Susan said. "You have
			<i>got</i> to try their eggs
			benedict. It's the best in Albany, I swear."
		</p>
		<p>"No, I'll be fine with the muffin, I'm sure." She knew without looking that
			she was the recipient of a questioning gaze from Ronnie.
			<i>Maybe she'll forget that my
				stomach grumbled earlier. </i>The waitress returned with their drinks and when they had
			been served she looked expectantly at Ronnie.
		</p>
		<p>With a nod of her head, the dark-haired woman indicated Rose. "She'll have two
			eggs, over medium with toast, corned beef hash and home fries. I'll have the same except I
			want bacon instead of the hash and my eggs should be over hard. Susan?"</p>
		<p>"I'll have a Belgian waffle with strawberries and cream."</p>
		<p>"All right, I'll have your food brought out to you shortly."</p>
		<p>Rose looked at Ronnie dumbfounded. "I said I was fine with a muffin."</p>
		<p>"Susan, would you excuse us for a moment please?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, Ronnie. Actually I think I need to make a trip to the ladies room."
			She picked up her purse and left the table.</p>
		<p>"Why did you do that?" There was no accusation in the young woman's tone,
			just curiosity.</p>
		<p>"Why did you lie about not being hungry?" Ronnie countered. "Look at me.
			Tell me you only wanted a muffin and that the cost had nothing to do with it." Her
			right hand slipped under the table and began stroking Rose's left thigh. "I
			understand that you think about how much everything costs. I wish you didn't, but I know
			you do. I also know that I wasn't going to sit here and let you eat just a muffin for
			breakfast." A smaller hand gripped hers under the table and squeezed. </p>
		<p>"Okay, thank you." Rose leaned closer. "Actually, the hash and eggs
			sounds wonderful."</p>
		<p>"You'll love them, trust me."</p>
		<p>A short time later Rose was wiping up her plate with the last bit of toast while the
			two sisters talked. The current topic was taxes, and for someone that always used the easy
			form, it was a subject she felt sorely out of place with. The Cartwright women, on the
			other hand, had jabbered on for the entire meal about exemptions and loopholes. Rose
			smiled and ate quietly, listening to the rich tones but not the words of her tall
			companion. She tuned Susan out completely and thus, missed her name the first time it was
			mentioned. "I'm sorry, what?"</p>
		<p>"I think we're boring her, Susan." Ronnie laughed when she saw the guilty
			blush cover the fair skin.</p>
		<p>"I said Wendy needs whatever receipts you have for your taxes." Seeing Rose's
			confused look, Susan explained. "Wendy is our accountant. She'll do your taxes for
			you but I think she's missing some paperwork. She only has your W-2 from Cartwright."</p>
		<p>"Well, I have the one from Money Slasher. It doesn't take me long to fill out the
			form so I hadn't gotten around to it yet. Why would I have an income statement from
			Cartwright? Ronnie didn't decide to give me the job as her secretary until last
			week."</p>
		<p>"Whoops," Ronnie said. "I can explain." She twisted in her seat so
			she could face Rose. The short bench and her long legs meant that her knee ended up
			resting atop the khaki covered thigh. "You remember when I had you sign all those
			forms so we could get you on the insurance? You went on the payroll then."</p>
		<p>"You mean you didn't know you were getting paid each week?" Susan asked. The
			still-shocked Rose shook her head. "You signed a direct deposit authorization for the
			credit union. You filled out a W-4 for your exemptions."</p>
		<p>"I don't remember what I signed. I was still in the hospital and with all the pain
			killers?."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, didn't you tell her what she was signing?"</p>
		<p>Now it was the executive's turn to blush. "Well?" She looked at Rose.
			"When you were in the hospital, all I could think about was making sure you got the
			best care possible. "I know I told you that you were now an employee of Cartwright
			Corp."</p>
		<p>"I didn't think you meant that I was actually getting paid." She discreetly
			laid her hand on Ronnie's knee. "There must be hundreds of dollars in there."</p>
		<p>"More like thousands," the executive corrected. "I don't pay my workers
			chump change like Money Slasher. I pay a living wage. That's why people with skill and
			talent don't leave us after a few years and join some other firm."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, I can't keep that money. I didn't earn it. Can't you just take it back or
			something?" That earned laughter from both Cartwrights. "What?"</p>
		<p>"Rose dear, do you have any idea how much paperwork would be involved in doing
			something like that?" Susan chuckled again. "It's impossible."</p>
		<p>"The money's yours, Rose," Ronnie added. "I'm sorry I didn't mention it
			before. I honestly don't think about things like paychecks and you certainly haven't
			needed any money."</p>
		<p>"It's okay. We can talk about it some other time." Rose put her coffee cup to
			her lips, mentally deciding which charities would get the money if she could not convince
			Ronnie to take it back.</p>
		<p>"Speaking of later," the executive looked at her watch. "We'd better get
			going here."</p>
		<p>"Wait." Susan laid her hand across the table, urging her sister to remain
			where she was. The redhead looked at Rose with such seriousness it made the young woman's
			pulse quicken with nervousness. "I just wanted to say something to you before we
			leave." She licked her lips and cast a quick glance at her older sister before
			continuing. "Rose, I love my sister very much. With Tommy gone, well?it just
			helped make me realize that I was being unfair to her. I've never seen her happier than
			when she's with you."</p>
		<p>"Susan, don't embarrass me," Ronnie warned playfully although the heat was
			rising to her ears.</p>
		<p>"Oh you be quiet or I'll tell her about the time you took Dad's car for a joyride
			and got picked up by the police," the younger sibling warned. "Now, as I was
			saying before I was so
			<i>rudely</i> interrupted, she's happy and that's what's
			important." She picked up the bill and glanced at it before passing it across the
			table to her sister. "Your turn. Six thirty-eight for the tip."
		</p>
		<p>"Thanks, you know I hate figuring that out." Ronnie reached into her purse
			and pulled out her wallet, thumbing through the various plastic cards until she found the
			one she was looking for. A few minutes later the bill was paid and they were standing next
			to their vehicles, which were parked side by side.</p>
		<p>"I have to drop Rose off and then I'll meet you at Mother's," Ronnie said as
			she shut off the alarm and unlocked the passenger door.</p>
		<p>"Okay, don't be too long." The redhead turned toward Rose. "It was nice
			of you to join us for breakfast."</p>
		<p>"Thank you for inviting me," she replied. "And thank you for what you
			said in there?about her deserving to be happy."</p>
		<p>"Yeah yeah, everybody's happy," Ronnie said with a fake growl. "Except
			Mother, who is going to have a fit if we don't get over there."</p>
		<p>"I was being serious," Rose said, batting the tall woman's arm.</p>
		<p>"So was I." She looked at her younger sister. "Susan, I do appreciate
			what you said in there?as well as last night."</p>
		<p>"Think they'd say anything if two sisters hugged in public?"</p>
		<p>"Do you really care if they did?" Ronnie countered. They embraced then, to
			Rose's surprise, Susan gave her a quick one-armed hug. They said their good-byes and were
			soon on the road.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>After being dropped off at the house, Rose found herself with nothing to do. Ronnie was
			certain not to be back until mid-afternoon. She puttered about, wandering in and out of
			every room on the first floor. Then her eyes followed the stairs. Curiosity got the better
			of her and she positioned her crutches on the bottom stair.</p>
		<p>Although she had been in Ronnie's bedroom before, this was the first time she really
			looked around.
			<i>This is big enough for an entire apartment. </i>A padded bench seat sat
			below an impressive bay window. An open door off to the side led to the private bathroom
			and the young woman made a mental note to check it out later. Rose saw that her friend had
			not one but two dressers as well as the incredible walk-in closet. A full-length mirror
			trimmed in matching wood stood in one corner. A headboard, complete with lights and
			shelves, complimented the king-sized bed. There were nightstands on either side as well.
			On the wall opposite the bed was a smaller version of the entertainment center downstairs.
			Rose opened the doors to reveal a twenty-seven inch television, Ronnie's video collection
			and a VCR. Her eyes skimmed over familiar titles, looking for something interesting to
			watch. One row of tapes had no boxes or labels on the spines. She picked one up and looked
			at the title.
			<i>Oh Ronnie, I didn't know you had
				<b>these</b> kind of tapes.
			</i>She
			grinned and put it in the VCR.
			<i>Well, this should be interesting. </i>She positioned the
			pillows on the bed and sat down to watch her first adult movie.
		</p>
		<p>To her surprise, there actually was a plot to the movie. Rose did not pay attention to
			the title but figured out quickly that it was about two female lovers who are separated
			into separate cells by a mean warden. The first sex scene appeared quickly and green eyes
			widened at the sight of the two naked women kissing each other. It was the same slow,
			gentle kisses she shared with Ronnie. Then their kisses changed. They became more
			passionate and one woman began to moan as the other pinched her nipple. Suddenly Rose's
			dreams had another dimension added to them as she tried to imagine Ronnie making the same
			sound. "Mmm?" She watched the two women begin their acts of pleasure and
			each one she imagined doing with her companion. The arousal was immediate but more than
			that was another feeling, one far more important. The women on the screen made Rose
			realize that this was more than a physical act. Even though they were actresses playing a
			role, every touch was tender, almost loving. Between the moans and cries were repeated
			declarations of love for each other.
			<i>That's why they call it making love,</i> she
			realized for perhaps the first time. Now she understood what she was denying
			Ronnie?and what Ronnie was denying herself by honoring her promise to her father.
			Shutting off the VCR off, Rose sat and stared at the blue screen for several long minutes
			while the final pieces of the puzzle fell into place.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Did you try the spare ribs?" Ronnie asked, smacking her lips in
			satisfaction. "I tell you, there's nothing like good Chinese take-out."</p>
		<p>"No, I haven't tried them yet," Rose replied quietly, her eyes never leaving
			her plate, the contents of which were being pushed around aimlessly by her fork.</p>
		<p>"You should. The egg rolls are pretty good too. Not greasy at all."</p>
		<p>"Um hmm." The broccoli and pork suffered more rearranging.</p>
		<p>"Rose, is something wrong? You've been quiet ever since I got home."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, can I ask you something?"</p>
		<p>"Anything, you know that."</p>
		<p>"If you had never made that promise to your father?if nothing was standing in
			your way?would you want?" The blonde woman shook her head and looked up
			with fear and uncertainty in her eyes. "Would we be lovers?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie stood up. "I think we're done eating. Let's go into the other room and
			talk. I'll take care of the dishes later."</p>
		<p>"Yes, that would be better." Rose agreed, pushing herself up on her good
			foot.
			<i>Yes, you and me curled up on the couch together? </i>"Ronnie? Would it
			be all right if we just went into the bedroom? I mean, we can always watch television in
			there, right?"
		</p>
		<p>Warning bells and whistles went off in Ronnie's head and she swallowed reflexively.
			"Uh?are you sure?" Considering the topic of discussion, she wasn't entirely
			certain that lying on the bed together was a wise idea.</p>
		<p>"Yes." And with that word spoken aloud, Rose realized that yes, she really
			was sure?about everything.</p>
		<p>Once inside the room, Rose leaned her crutches against the wall and patiently balanced
			herself on her good foot.</p>
		<p>"You want to change first?" Ronnie asked while turning down the covers.</p>
		<p>"No, we're fine just the way we are." Once the bedcovers were ready, she
			slipped between them and rolled onto her side to face the woman who had captured her
			heart. Ronnie started to join her. "Wait." Rose reached over and turned on the
			lamp. "Would you shut off the light?" Soon the brightness was replaced by a
			warm, soft glow.</p>
		<p>"So we're in bed and you wanted to talk," Ronnie offered when she was
			settled.</p>
		<p>"So we are," she agreed. Leaning up on one elbow, she looked down at endless
			blue eyes. "Are you going to answer my question? If you hadn't made that promise to
			your father, would we be lovers?"</p>
		<p>"I thought you weren't sure?"</p>
		<p>"Forget about that for a minute." She reached out and ran her fingertip
			lightly down the older woman's jawline. "If it were just you and me, nothing
			else." Ronnie was still wearing her gray shirt and with three buttons undone, the
			vision was entirely too tempting. Rose moved her fingertip down the chiseled jaw to the
			long throat and beyond, stopping only when it encountered the lacy edge of a bra. She did
			note with some pleasure that the older woman's breathing had increased.</p>
		<p>"Rose, I love you. You know that." Ronnie reached out and cupped her cheek.
			"If there were no obstacles, if it really was just you and me, yes. I would be very
			honored to be your lover." She was rewarded with a quick kiss. The curious fingertips
			were driving her crazy but she could not find the strength to stop them.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?" The distracting digits slowly undid the next button on the
			gray shirt. "It's just you and me. There are no obstacles."</p>
		<p>"Rose?" Her body responded immediately to her shirt being unbuttoned.
			Nipples hardened under the white bra and her whole body tingled with excitement. She
			opened her mouth to protest and found a warm, soft tongue pressing against hers.
			"Mmm." Under the gentle insistence, Ronnie relaxed and let the young woman take
			control. Rose felt the surrender and eased up the pressure of her lips. Her free hand
			traveled of its own volition, gliding under the cotton shirt and against warm skin. In a
			move that shocked both of them, the wandering hand closed over the soft lace cup and
			squeezed gently. Ronnie gasped and her body leaned into the touch.</p>
		<p>"You like that," Rose observed, giving the firm mound another squeeze and
			enjoying the immediate reaction. Leaving her hand where it was, she lowered her head until
			her lips were against her lover's ear. "Ronnie," she said huskily. "I love
			you and I want to make love with you." She accented her statement by suckling a
			willing earlobe, then working her way up to Ronnie's mouth. Being careful not to hit the
			older woman's shin, Rose slid her left leg between the longer ones.</p>
		<p>"Rose?" She reached with every intention of stopping this before it went
			too far but instead of her body obeying her mind, her hand closed around Rose's,
			encouraging further exploration. Ronnie was on fire and she struggled to find a reason to
			resist. "W-we shouldn't."</p>
		<p>"Why?" The blonde woman pulled her hand out from under the cotton shirt and
			looked at her lover with all seriousness. "Tell me why we should keep denying this to
			ourselves?"</p>
		<p>"I promised?" Fingers pressed against the full lips.</p>
		<p>"No." There was a quiet anger in Rose's voice. "No Ronnie. You can
			promise many things but giving up your happiness forever is not one of them." She
			gently traced one defined black eyebrow. "You can't promise to give up my happiness,
			either." Her eyes fluttered down to study full lips before traveling back up to
			become lost in endless pools of blue. Ronnie did not move, still struggling with her inner
			demons. Propped on her right elbow, Rose used her left hand to undo her blouse, gravity
			causing it to expose more and more flesh as each button was undone. She smiled at the
			intense look in Ronnie's eyes. Once the rust colored shirt was hanging loose, Rose took
			the larger hand in her own and brought it to the area covered by beige silk. "Please,
			no, don't fight it," she whispered when she felt Ronnie's resistance. She pressed her
			breast against the warm hand and groaned when she felt the tentative squeeze.</p>
		<p>Rose's limited experience had not prepared her for the jolt that Ronnie's touch brought
			her. Another squeeze and she was sure she would simply die without her lover's touch. She
			felt herself being pushed back onto the bed and did not resist. Long dark tresses tickled
			her face and the tongue seeking entrance to her mouth was quite insistent.
			"Yessmphf."
			<i>Nothing can feel better than this,</i> she thought to herself
			wistfully as she returned the kiss with equal gusto.
		</p>
		<p>"I love you," Ronnie breathed as the kiss finally ended. She was propped up
			on her elbow, her body half on top of the smaller woman. She felt Rose trying to tug the
			gray shirt out of the jeans. "Wait." Rolling up to her knees, she unbuttoned and
			unzipped her pants. She undid the last button on her shirt and slowly pulled the tails
			out. It now hung loosely on her body, open enough to show a glimpse of her bra beneath.
			With a slowness that was torture to the young woman's nervous system, Ronnie slid the gray
			material off her shoulders, letting it pool on the bed behind her. "This too?"
			she asked, fingering the front catch of her bra.</p>
		<p>"Please," Rose begged. Her lover smiled at the urgency in her voice. A quick
			twist and the cups fell apart. The bra landed on top of the shirt and for several seconds
			neither woman spoke. Rose's eyes were taking in the most beautiful sight she had ever seen
			and she said so with the look on her face. "Kiss me again."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh yes, this is so much better,</i> she thought to herself as her hands traveled
			over the bare skin of Ronnie's back. She was acutely aware of the places where her shirt
			was open and their skin touched. They shared a series of lazy kisses until she felt a
			restless hand trying to push her shirt off. "Yes," she agreed, trying to take it
			off while still lying on her back.
		</p>
		<p>"Please?let me," Ronnie begged. Rose nodded and let herself be pulled
			into a sitting position. Her shirt found itself tossed against the leather chair in
			Ronnie's quest to get it out of her way. The beige bra ended up on the floor. She lowered
			herself back to the bed but her lover remained where she was. Hearts pounded and bodies
			pulsed as they stared openly at each other's breasts. Where her own areola was a light
			pink, Ronnie's was darker, almost brown. She looked down and was surprised to see her
			nipples standing out like little erasers, the skin around them still soft but starting to
			pucker.
			<i>Even the coldest day doesn't make them stand up like that</i> she mused as she
			looked back to see her lover's nipples beginning to do the same thing.
		</p>
		<p>"You?are?beautiful," Ronnie whispered. She lowered herself down and
			slowly, far too slowly, bare skin touched bare skin. Both groaned softly and smiled in
			recognition of the mutual pleasure. Long fingers sank into golden hair while smaller ones
			wrapped around a muscled back. Their mouths played a game of give and take, tongues
			dancing back and forth as they floated in each other's love.</p>
		<p>"Oh?oh yes, that's nice," Rose gasped when she felt her lover's mouth
			move down to her neck. She felt lips part and the soft tongue lick her skin. She moved her
			hands up to rest on the back of Ronnie's head. "Yes?mmm, that feels so
			good."</p>
		<p>"Yesss." Ronnie's body was pressing against hers, betraying the older woman's
			rising passion. Rose let her right hand drift down until she reached the waistband of the
			black jeans. Since they were still undone, there was plenty of room for her to slip
			inside. As she gripped the firm cheek, Ronnie whimpered against her skin and began sucking
			her neck in earnest. "Rose?"</p>
		<p>"Yes Ronnie?that feels so good." She squeezed harder and was rewarded
			with renewed squirming.</p>
		<p>"You're going to drive me crazy, you know that? I can't concentrate when you do
			that," she admitted as she shifted her ass away from Rose's distracting caresses. She
			nudged the smaller legs apart with one of her own, settling so her lips were even with the
			young woman's breasts. Long black hair formed a soft canopy that tickled as it moved over
			the fair skin. "I love you so much," Ronnie said breathlessly as she reclaimed
			Rose's lips for her own. Nostrils flared with ragged breaths as they kissed passionately.</p>
		<p>"But?" Whatever Rose was going to say was lost when she felt a kiss on
			the underside of her breast. "Ooooh." Ronnie answered with a muffled moan of her
			own and continued to lick and nibble her soft flesh. "Feels so good?"
			<i>Oh,
				this is heaven. Nothing can feel better than this. </i>She felt warm breath on her nipple
			an instant before a wet tongue rolled over it. "Oh, Ronnie, yesss?."
		</p>
		<p>Fumbling attempts with teenage boys had never prepared Rose for the sensation of being
			lovingly suckled. The pulling sensation was answered with a pulsing deep between her legs
			and her hips moved of their own volition, pressing hard against Ronnie. Her hands were
			buried deep in the dark hair and she was torn between holding Ronnie where she was or
			begging her to give the other one the same attention. Before she could decide, the loving
			tongue and lips released their treasure. "Oh, don't stop?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie chuckled and pressed her thigh against Rose's center. "I'm not
			stopping." Using her elbows to brace herself, she leaned down for a kiss. "I
			love you, Rose."</p>
		<p>"I love you." As their mouths continued to give and take, Rose's hands worked
			their way between their bodies and cupped two willing mounds of flesh. Ronnie's moan
			vibrated through their lips and Rose answered with one of her own. Her fingers became more
			focused, moving in smaller circles until they were gently stroking the hardened tips.</p>
		<p>"Oh Honey," Ronnie gasped. "Y-you can't?unggh?do that."
			She rocked back out of reach and shook her head. "I told you I can't concentrate when
			you do that."</p>
		<p>"It feels so nice." Rose reached out only to have her hands stopped by
			larger, more powerful ones.</p>
		<p>"Yes it does," the older woman agreed. She kissed each knuckle, then the
			palms before releasing Rose's hands.</p>
		<p>"I want?"
			<i>How do I say this without sounding crude? </i>"I
			want?" She wrapped her arms around Ronnie's torso and pulled herself up, ducking
			her head in time to bring her mouth to its goal.
		</p>
		<p>"Oh God, Rose!"</p>
		<p>Rose found her head held in place by Ronnie's hands as she happily ran her tongue over
			the darkened areola.
			<i>Oh yes?this is nice. </i>She heard as much as felt Ronnie's
			increased breathing and smiled against the erect nipple before rubbing her lips back and
			forth against it. She gave in to the strong but gentle hands pushing her back onto the
			bed.
		</p>
		<p>"Let?me?show?you?something I want?my rose," Ronnie
			said before lowering her mouth to Rose's breast.</p>
		<p>"Oooh?." Ronnie's mouth and hands were in constant motion on her
			breasts. Her hands clasped and unclasped the dark hair and her hips were in constant
			motion against the older woman's torso. "Ronnieeee?" She looked down to see
			the mouth loving her breast. "You feel?oh, so nice?do that?." Her
			breathing quickened and her hips pressed up hard against Ronnie's torso. Her lover
			answered with a downward thrust against her thigh, making both acutely aware of their own
			wetness. "Please?I need?" She tried to reach between their bodies for
			the button to her pants.</p>
		<p>"Yesss?" Ronnie took over the task, releasing the breast she was
			suckling and rising up to give herself room. Long fingers made quick work of the button
			and zipper but instead of removing them, the black-haired woman settled back down, laying
			sideways over Rose to allow her right hand to slip between khakis and white cotton
			panties.</p>
		<p>"Oh yes, YES!" Rose cried as two fingers pressed against her most sensitive
			area. She cupped Ronnie's face and pulled her up for a heated kiss.
			<i>Oh please don't
				stop.</i> Her rocking hips caused slack in the material, giving more room for the
			mischievous digits to explore. They peeked under the elastic then retreated, alternating
			soft brushes with firm rubs. Rose was rising fast, faster than she had ever known and it
			scared her. She buried her head in Ronnie's hair and clung tightly.
			"Ronnie?" Her breaths were coming in quick pants and she was not sure if
			she would survive the intense pleasure coursing through her system. The fingers changed
			direction, rubbing the cotton in a circular motion against her clit. Rose whimpered and
			jerked her hips frantically. "I can't?oh Ronnie?please?I?"
		</p>
		<p>"Shh?I've got you?"</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?oooh?" Her hands clutched desperately at her lover's
			shoulders. "Please?harder?OH?yes Ronnie, yesss?" Warm breath
			caressed her ear, both comforting and exciting her at the same time.</p>
		<p>"Rose, I love you."</p>
		<p>"Yesss." A deep pounding started deep within and gained momentum as it spread
			outward.</p>
		<p>"My precious Rose?yes, you're close, I can feel it." The pressure and
			rhythm increased and the young woman's body reacted, rocking back and forth faster while
			her fingers gripped Ronnie's shoulders tighter.</p>
		<p>"Yes?harder?ooh?." Her teeth tightly clenched, Rose teetered
			on the edge for an agonizing length of time. Then one long finger snaked under the soaked
			panties and slipped between her swollen folds. "Oh God!" Once, twice, three
			times across her clit and the world exploded for Rose. "Ronneeeee?.ah." She
			cried out as the orgasm pulsed through her, robbing the young woman of all reason and
			sense. A husky voice murmured words she did not understand into her ear and she was
			vaguely aware of being rocked gently but reality was a plane far far away from her at that
			moment. She felt her body go limp and trusted the strong arms around her to protect as she
			drifted off in the afterglow.</p>
		<p>Long minutes later Rose found the strength to raise her head and look into loving eyes
			of blue. "I love you."</p>
		<p>"Mmm, I love you too," Ronnie said, sealing her words with a kiss.</p>
		<p>"Do you want me to move?"</p>
		<p>"No, stay here, I want to hold you."</p>
		<p>"Sounds good," Rose murmured, nuzzling deeper into her lover's embrace.
			"I could just stay like this forever."</p>
		<p>"Sure. As long as you want." Ronnie was deliriously happy and content to
			spend the rest of the evening cuddling despite not having found her own release yet. All
			that mattered to her was the gentle woman in her arms. Minutes ticked by before Rose's
			head lifted again. "You okay?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Terrific," the blonde woman replied, kissing the bare flesh near her lips.
			"You are wonderful."</p>
		<p>"I aim to please."</p>
		<p>"Mmm, good aim," Rose quipped.</p>
		<p>"Did I tell you that I love you?"</p>
		<p>"Once or twice, tell me again." She flashed a brilliant smile that Ronnie
			felt the need to reward with a series of kisses.</p>
		<p>"I?love?you?with?all?my?heart." Unable to
			resist, she deepened the kiss, rolling them over so Rose was on the bottom. But when she
			began to kiss a line down the smaller woman's throat, Ronnie found herself stopped by
			insistent hands. She lifted up and the hands moved to claim her breasts. Understanding the
			unspoken request, Ronnie locked her elbows to hold herself above her lover's body. She had
			forgotten how sensitive her nipples were until she felt Rose's palms rub across them. She
			moaned and arched into the touch. "Oh yes?that's nice."</p>
		<p>"You like this," the young woman observed.</p>
		<p>"Very?" The hands moved and Ronnie now found her nipples being brushed
			by inquisitive thumbs. "Very much." She felt Rose's forefingers join and begin
			squeezing in a pumping motion. "Oh yes, that's sooo nice?" She tried to
			watch but it felt too good and her eyes refused to stay open. "Yes Rose, that's
			it?nice and gentle?mmm."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?" The small hands left her breasts and wrapped around her back,
			gently urging her forward. Taking the hint when she saw the pink tongue dart out and wet
			lips in anticipation, she straddled Rose's body and leaned forward until her breasts were
			swaying just above the waiting mouth. This time she forced herself to watch. Her eyes
			moved from golden hair and fair skin to russet eyebrows framing green eyes. The path
			continued, past the soft cheekbones and upturned nose to the lips and loving tongue
			providing relief to her aching nipple. As if what her eyes were showing her was not
			enough, Ronnie's ears were treated to the pleasure of constant mmm's from Rose and hands
			which had been casually touching her body now slipped under the waistband of her jeans.</p>
		<p>"Let me?ooh?Rose?let me take them off. I need to take them
			off." She regretted her request when she felt the warm mouth leave her sensitive
			flesh.</p>
		<p>"Yes," the young woman agreed, trying to push the black material down.</p>
		<p>"I'll get it." Rolling off, Ronnie quickly shucked her jeans and panties.
			Before she could return to her previous position, she found herself pinned down by her
			small but insistent lover. Rose's mouth reclaimed her breast while a khaki covered thigh
			slipped between her legs. The coarse material rubbed against an already swollen clit and
			Ronnie cried out at the contact.</p>
		<p>"Did I hurt you?" Rose asked, her eyes fearful.</p>
		<p>"No." She reached out and stroked the soft cheek, gently urging her to resume
			her task. "No honey, you didn't hurt me. Please?just keep doing?"
			Ronnie sighed as the warm tongue caressed her breast again. "?what you're
			doing." She felt something hard scratch her skin just above her calf and, remembering
			an incident earlier in the week, spread her legs to give plenty of room between her
			lover's cast and her still-healing shin. The shift caused her thigh to press up between
			Rose's legs. The mmm's were interrupted by what Ronnie considered to be a very cute squeak
			and she repeated the motion, earning a deep groan and a return thrust from the blonde
			woman.
			<i>What's good for the goose? </i>Her long fingers easily slid under the
			khakis and panties to grip soft round flesh.
		</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Take these off, Rose." Her fingers crept lower until they brushed over wet
			curls. "Let me touch you." An emphatic nod was all she needed to roll them over.
			As she worked the material over the cast, a flicker of guilt tried to slip in but love
			quickly shut it out. Her eyes traveled upward, her pulse quickening at the wet spot
			visible in the crotch of Rose's panties. Blonde curls peeked out, teasing with a hint of
			what was hidden. Wresting away from the temptation, Ronnie gazed upon the firm abdomen,
			the perfect breasts, the look of desire and passion on her beloved's face. "You are
			so beautiful," she whispered reverently. Hooking her fingers under the waistband, she
			removed the last barrier before gathering Rose up in her arms.</p>
		<p>For long minutes they cuddled together, exchanging kisses and gentle touches while
			becoming used to both touching and being touched. It was Ronnie who took the first step,
			moving her hand down and running her fingers through the soft blonde tufts. "You like
			that?" she murmured, her lips a hairsbreadth away from Rose's ear.</p>
		<p>"Mmm, that's nice." She tried to do the same but sitting on her lover's lap
			made that feat impossible. "I want to touch you too."</p>
		<p>"I'd like that," Ronnie admitted, shifting them until they were lying side by
			side. She had to scoot up slightly to accommodate Rose's shorter reach but soon fingers
			were playing in both light and dark curls. "You're soft, like a kitten," she
			remarked. Her middle finger moved lower, wetting itself on slick folds. Bringing it up to
			her mouth, Ronnie licked the sweet essence. "Mmm?.oh!" She was taken by
			surprise when Rose's finger not only touched her nether lips but dipped between them,
			brushing against her clitoris. Her hand shot down and gripped the small wrist.
			"Please?" Taking two of Rose's fingers, she used her longer ones to guide
			them against her center. "Ah?oh yes." Ronnie raised her knee and opened
			herself up to her lover. "Rose, please?" She pressed the smaller fingers
			against her in a circular motion and sighed. She felt the slickness on her inner thighs
			and dimly noted that her own self-pleasuring never produced such a copious amount of
			fluid.</p>
		<p>"I've got it," Rose said as she took control, leaning over and gently nudging
			Ronnie back against the bed. "Do?do you want me to?go inside?" She
			spoke the last words haltingly but Ronnie's answering groan and hip rise eased any fears
			that she had. Slowly, hesitantly, she pushed one finger in. She was amazed at the feeling
			of hot wet muscle surrounding her finger.
			<i>Oh Ronnie?you're so warm and soft. </i>Ronnie's
			reaction was immediate, crying out and pressing herself hard against Rose's finger.
		</p>
		<p>"Yes Sweetheart, more?please Rose?yessss." She put in a second,
			then a third. The transformation was amazing. The head of a major corporation was
			incapable of forming a complete sentence. Her name became a mantra on Ronnie's lips,
			combined with words such as harder, faster, deeper, and the occasional oh fuck just to
			round it out. Rose pressed in deeper, the webbing between her ring and pinky fingers
			burning as she tried to fulfill her lover's request.
			<i>Oh God, Ronnie?you feel so
				good.</i> The dark-haired woman bucked beneath her but Rose refused to let go of her
			prize. The feel of inner muscles squeezing her fingers excited her and there was no doubt
			in her mind that Ronnie's voice was a good two octaves higher than normal. The metal bed
			frame squeaked with each thrust and her lover's cries became more urgent.
			"Rose."
		</p>
		<p>"I'm right here." She turned her head and kissed the soft skin.</p>
		<p>"I?Rose?" The tall woman's thighs began trembling.</p>
		<p>"I love you, Ronnie." She felt the muscles surrounding her fingers tightening
			and began pumping as hard and fast as she could. Suddenly she was caught in a grip too
			powerful to break as her lover's hips arched off the bed.</p>
		<p>"I?" Dark bangs stuck to the sweat soaked forehead and every word was
			torn from gritted teeth. "Love?you?oh Rose?Rose, I, I?ohhh."</p>
		<p>"Yes Honey?yes." They rode it out together, Rose's fingers buried deep
			inside. Only when the last spasm passed did she remove her fingers and snuggle up in
			Ronnie's arms.</p>
		<p>"That's a pretty big smile you have your face," Ronnie said when speech
			returned.</p>
		<p>"I'm happy."</p>
		<p>"Mmm." She kissed Rose's forehead. "I'm glad to hear it."</p>
		<p>"Can I ask you something?"</p>
		<p>"How many times do I have to answer that question?"</p>
		<p>"Sorry." She kissed Ronnie's lips in apology?then again for the sheer
			pleasure of it. Cuddling up as close as she could, Rose rested her head on the broad
			shoulder. "Was it?what you expected?"
			<i>Did I really please you?</i>
		</p>
		<p>"It was everything I wanted and more." Rose felt fingers under her chin and
			she raised her head to look into gentle blue eyes. "How about you?" Ronnie
			asked. "This is your first time. How are you doing with this?"</p>
		<p>Rose scooted up and brought their lips together. "I feel very?very
			loved." She put her head back on Ronnie's shoulder. "Mmm, nice."</p>
		<p>"Just nice?"</p>
		<p>"More than nice." She turned on her stomach and rested her head on Ronnie's
			abdomen. "I think I'll make this my new pillow." With her lover's warmth against
			her, Rose let her eyes close. "Mmm, you can keep that up."</p>
		<p>"With pleasure." Shifting her arm to a more comfortable position, Ronnie
			began running her hand up and down the length of Rose's back. "Like this?"</p>
		<p>"Mm hmm."</p>
		<p>Some moments in life are just simply perfect. For the new lovers, this was one of them.
			Relaxed?sated?simply enjoying the feel of each other's bodies. Ronnie's hand
			played over her lover's back, alternating between lazy figure eights and long sweeping
			passes from shoulders to hips. Rose returned the loving touch with one of her own, letting
			her fingers glide over the supple thigh. The tender caresses were nice but arms could stay
			empty for only so long before the need grew too great. "Come here," Ronnie
			whispered, holding her arms out. Soon they were cuddled together, sharing soft kisses and
			gentle words of love. Eventually the lamp was shut off and sleep never claimed two happier
			women.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Sleepy blue eyes opened to a curtain of gold. Ronnie smiled, enjoying the feel of
			Rose's hair upon her face. She stretched in place, reveling in the feel of skin against
			skin. It was a wonderful feeling and one which she had no wish to end soon. She glanced at
			the clock and groaned. She was torn between studying the sleeping woman or waking her up
			before Maria arrived.
			<i>I have the rest of our lives to watch you sleep. </i>"Rose?honey,
			time to wake up." A gentle shoulder shake?nothing.
			"Rose?Rose?" The sleeping lump groaned and burrowed under the covers.
			"No no no," Ronnie chuckled. Hooking her fingers on the edge of the blanket, she
			pulled it away to expose their naked bodies to the cool morning air. Rose's hand
			automatically reached out for the missing warmth only to be caught by Ronnie's larger one.
			"Good morning." She pulled the hand up to her lips and began kissing each
			knuckle. "I?love?you?Rose."
		</p>
		<p>"Mmm, love you too," she replied, turning bleary green eyes up to look at her
			dark-haired lover. "How about we sleep in today, hmm?"</p>
		<p>"I'd love to but Maria is going to be here soon." She ran her finger down the
			length of Rose's cheek. "I didn't wake up in time to call and tell her not to
			come," she apologized.</p>
		<p>"It's okay. You didn't know that we would?" She blushed. "You
			know?"</p>
		<p>"Make love?" Ronnie offered, rolling them over until she was on top. Her hair
			hung down, bushing against Rose's cheek. Unable to resist, she lowered her lips for a
			kiss. "I love you." She reluctantly pulled back. "But right now I have to
			pee?bad."</p>
		<p>"Better make it quick 'cause I'll be right behind you," the young woman said,
			reaching out for her crutches.</p>
		<p>When Rose returned from the bathroom, she discovered Ronnie half dressed. Feeling a bit
			awkward with her own nakedness, she crossed over to her dresser and began pulling out
			clothes to wear. She sat down on the edge of the bed and reached for her panties. The next
			thing she knew, she was flat on her back with six feet of raw woman lying on top of her.
			"Do you have any idea how much I love you?" Ronnie breathed, blue eyes darkened
			with emotion. Lips lowered and were met halfway by an equally eager pair. Soft moans of
			pleasure filled the air as the kiss deepened and tongues danced together. Rose's hands
			were happily playing across the broad expanse of back and had just slipped down to cup
			Ronnie's ass through her clothes when they heard the sound of Maria's car pull into the
			driveway. New lovers being what they were, the kiss did not end until they heard the sound
			of the car door shutting. "I suppose we have to stop." The executive's tone made
			it clear that stopping was not what she truly wished to do.</p>
		<p>"If we must," Rose replied, leaning up for one more quick kiss before her
			tall lover stood up.</p>
		<p>"Unless you want to give Maria an eyeful." Ronnie pulled a gray cotton
			T-shirt over her head and tucked it into the waistband of her sweats. "I'll go keep
			her company while you get dressed." Unable to resist, she stole one more sweet kiss
			before leaving the room.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Good morning, Ronnie," the housekeeper said as she stepped inside and closed
			the sliding glass door. "Oh, it's cold out there this morning. I thought we'd seen
			the last of the snow this season."</p>
		<p>"Oh, there'll probably be one more good storm to annoy us before spring
			arrives," the executive said, taking the daily paper from Maria's hands. At that
			moment Tabitha ambled into the kitchen, looking for her morning meal. "Mrrow?
			Mrrow?"</p>
		<p>"And where do you think you're going?" Ronnie asked as she scooped the feline
			up in her arms. "Hmm? What's that? You want sliced turkey for breakfast, did you
			say?" The answering purr and finger lick caused both women to laugh. </p>
		<p>"That cat is so spoiled," Maria said as she headed for the laundry room to
			hang her coat up. "I know both of you slip pieces of meat under the table for her
			when you're eating. That's why it's so hard to keep her out of the kitchen."</p>
		<p>"Oh, and it has nothing to do with the scraps you 'accidentally' drop on the floor
			while you're cooking, right?"</p>
		<p>"Good morning," Rose said as she entered the room. "Oh Maria, I hope
			you're planning on making a hearty breakfast because I'm starving this morning. Morning,
			Tabitha." Leaning her armpits against her crutches, she stood directly in front of
			Ronnie and began stroking her cat, although her eyes never left the smile on her lover's
			face. "I hope you slept well," she whispered.</p>
		<p>"The best. How about you?" The executive's voice carried the same soft tone
			that had soothed Rose after their lovemaking and the young woman reacted to it without
			thought, pressing her head against Ronnie's chest and drawing a startled squawk from
			Tabitha.</p>
		<p>"Wonderful." She pulled back and petted the cat, turning the purr motor back
			on. "Wonderful and hungry." </p>
		<p>"I'll have breakfast ready in about twenty minutes," Maria said without
			looking up from the eggs she was whisking. When she turned her back to begin making
			coffee, Ronnie took advantage and leaned down to give Rose a gentle kiss. Tired of being
			squished between the lovers, Tabitha wormed her way free and padded out to the living
			room.</p>
		<p>Maria turned to ask a question but found herself speechless at the sight before her.
			The two women were kissing deeply, Ronnie's hands buried in Rose's hair. Turning away
			quickly, the housekeeper refused to turn around again until she heard the sounds of chairs
			being pulled out and the newspaper being opened up. Pleased that the coffee maker had a
			pause option, she pulled the pot out and filled two mugs.</p>
		<p>"Here you go, Rose," she said sweetly as she set the steaming cup down in
			front of the young woman.</p>
		<p>"Thank you."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie." She set a yellow mug down and returned to the island to check on
			the eggs. A sable eyebrow raised at the unfamiliar cup and Ronnie exchanged a quizzical
			look with Rose before shrugging and returning to the stock market report.</p>
		<p>A short while later Maria returned to the table with two plates. Ronnie's plate
			contained a small cheese omelet and toast while Rose's was laden down with a stuffed
			omelet, a slice of fresh melon, and toast with grape jelly.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Maria. You know exactly how I like it." The young woman beamed,
			earning a smile from the housekeeper.</p>
		<p>"Yes I do. Now if you ladies will excuse me I do have to get going on the
			laundry." She took an empty basket from the laundry room and went to collect the
			dirty clothes. The lovers returned to their breakfast before a thought went through Rose's
			mind. "Ronnie, she's gonna see the clothes tossed all over the room." Her face
			began to color with embarrassment.</p>
		<p>"I hope she checks under the bed. I think that's where your underwear ended
			up," Ronnie replied, wiggling her eyebrows lecherously. </p>
		<p>"Ronnie!" She swatted the muscled arm. "It's not funny."</p>
		<p>"I know it's not," the executive apologized. "Come here." She moved
			her chair slightly and pulled Rose against her. "Honey, she's going to find out
			sooner or later."</p>
		<p>"Think she'll be okay with it?"</p>
		<p>"Of course. I've known Maria since I was a little kid. She knows how much you mean
			to me. I'm sure she'll be happy," Ronnie said confidently.</p>
		<p>But the housekeeper was anything but happy. She returned with a basket full of dirty
			laundry just as the women were finishing their meal. "Veronica, I need to speak with
			you," she said testily before going into the laundry room. The washer lid opened then
			closed with a bang. The dryer suffered the same abuse. "What's going on?" Rose
			asked worriedly.</p>
		<p>"I don't know but I'll go find out." Ronnie threw her napkin down and entered
			the laundry room, shutting the door behind her.</p>
		<p>"What's going on, Maria?"</p>
		<p>"You know it would be a lot easier for me if I didn't have to look all over the
			place for your clothes." She kept her back to her employer, seemingly matching up
			clean socks.</p>
		<p>"You wanted to talk to me about leaving my clothes on the floor? I've left them
			lying around before and you never got this upset." Ronnie stepped closer. "You
			were upset before breakfast. My mug isn't dirty. You gave me that ugly yellow thing on
			purpose. Why?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not a fool, Veronica. I have eyes." Wrinkled hands held sweat socks in a
			death grip. "How could you do this?"</p>
		<p>"I assume this has nothing to do with clothes and stop with the Veronica crap.
			You're talking about Rose and me." She waited for a response but her housekeeper
			continued to forcefully fold the socks. "What's the problem, Maria? It's okay to be a
			lesbian as long as I don't act like one?"</p>
		<p>Maria turned and leveled an angry glare. "I have always been supportive of you and
			your choices. How dare you think otherwise."</p>
		<p>"Then what is it?" Her jaw tensed in anger. "Rose has been living here
			for over three months. You had to know that we were sleeping together."</p>
		<p>"Sleeping, Ronnie, sleeping." Maria jerked the sheets out of the basket and
			stuffed them into the washer. "You certainly weren't 'sleeping' with Rose last
			night." Detergent was haphazardly tossed in and the lid slammed shut. "It's
			wrong, just plain wrong what you're doing to her."</p>
		<p>"Why is it wrong to love her? Why is today any different than yesterday? Help me
			understand why you're so upset because right now I don't understand!" Ronnie slammed
			her hand on the dryer, the noise reverberating through the small room. "She isn't
			like Christine, Maria. This is Rose we're talking about."</p>
		<p>"I know she's not like Christine. I never said she was. Rose is a sweet, kind,
			gentle woman who deserves all the best that life can give." She huffed over to the
			counter and began sorting the clean clothes. "She's been hurt enough."</p>
		<p>"What?" Ronnie shook her head. "What are you talking about?" She
			put her hands on the housekeeper's shoulders and turned the older woman to face her.
			Maria's eyes were shiny and Ronnie softened her tone. "I love Rose. I would never
			hurt her."</p>
		<p>"You don't think keeping the truth from her is going to hurt her?"</p>
		<p>"And just what truth am I keeping from her?" she asked hesitantly.</p>
		<p>"I know about the accident?I saw the Porsche before Hans fixed it."</p>
		<p>The color drained from Ronnie's face and she leaned against the dryer, hoping her legs
			would keep her upright. "Oh God," she whispered. She looked at her lifelong
			friend and housekeeper with panicked blue eyes. "Maria, you can't say anything. You
			can't tell her."</p>
		<p>"Tell her?" The older woman ran her fingers through her short salt and pepper
			hair and shook her head. "No Ronnie, I won't tell her. I know my position well."
			She turned back to the pile of clothes. "Besides, it's not my place to say anything,
			it's yours." She paused for a moment. "Or are you going to just let her continue
			thinking you're her knight in shining armor?"</p>
		<p>The words stung but Ronnie could not deny them. "I?I can't tell her. I can't
			lose her. I can't." Her voice hitched and she had to look away. "I would give up
			everything to be with her but I can't do that."</p>
		<p>"Better she should go on believing some drunk hit her and you came to her rescue
			than to admit you were responsible." Maria paused, debating whether she really wanted
			to ask the next question or not. "Were you drunk?" At the lack of response, she
			turned, reading her answer in the tall woman's face. "Dear God?you were."</p>
		<p>Long dark hair formed a curtain as Ronnie lowered her head and nodded ashamedly.
			"It was snowing and I?I never saw her until it was too late." She took
			several breaths before speaking again. "I would give anything to change what happened
			that night." She looked up, blue eyes shining. "But I can't. Please, you can't
			say anything to her."</p>
		<p>Maria looked away and for a minute nothing was heard but the thumping of the dryer as
			both women wrestled with their thoughts. After what seemed an eternity to Ronnie, the
			housekeeper sighed and nodded.</p>
		<p>"I'm not going to be the one to ruin that child's happiness, even if it is a lie.
			She's had too many ugly truths already." She turned to face Ronnie. "I won't be
			the one to tell her."</p>
		<p>Ronnie released a deep breath "I love her, Maria. I love her more than I have ever
			loved anyone in my life and I can't lose her." She stood next to the older woman and
			leaned her elbows on the pile of fresh linens. "If I can?" she stared at
			the wall, "?I'll spend the rest of my life making her happy. Please give me that
			chance."</p>
		<p>"The longer you keep the truth from her the worse it will be when she does find
			out. You owe her the truth, Ronnie."</p>
		<p>"I know," she acknowledged. "But I can't. Not yet."</p>
		<p>"You go see to her. I have things here I need to do." At Ronnie's questioning
			look, she said "Go on, I'll be fine once I'm done in here. I just need a few
			minutes."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"What was that all about?" Rose asked when Ronnie returned.</p>
		<p>"She's just having a bad day, that's all," she lied. "I think Tommy's
			death still has her upset."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure it's nothing I've done?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sure it's nothing you've done, Hon." She leaned over and gave Rose a
			quick kiss on the head. "Come on, I'm sure there's a few Judge Judy tapes lying
			around that I haven't seen yet." She lowered her lips until they were level with a
			shapely ear. "I'd love to cuddle up on the couch with you."</p>
		<p>"I thought you didn't want to give Maria a show?" Rose queried.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"What?" She put her hand to her chest as if to say 'who me?' "You
			don't think I can keep my hands to myself?"</p>
		<p>"No." The blonde woman smiled and, balancing on one foot, set the crutches
			aside. She wrapped her arms around Ronnie's waist and moved in close. "I'm not sure I
			can keep
			<i>my</i> hands to myself." She reached down and grabbed a handful of soft
			rear. "See what I mean?"
		</p>
		<p>"Have I turned you into a sex addict overnight?"</p>
		<p>"No, of course not." Rose blushed and leaned her head against Ronnie's chest.
			"I just enjoy touching you so much and I know you like it too."</p>
		<p>"Very much so," the dark-haired woman murmured.</p>
		<p>"You know?" Green eyes looked up and became helplessly lost in blue.
			"I don't care what we watch as long as I can be in your arms." Lips brushed
			together just as Maria came out of the laundry room. There was no mistaking the love
			passing between the two women. It mollified the housekeeper somewhat and she was able to
			put a smile on her face when Rose turned to look at her. "Maria, I'm sorry about the
			clothes, I'll make sure to put them in the hamper from now on," she said, thinking
			that the messy clothes were the reason the housekeeper was so upset.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Rose. I didn't mean to snap like that. I don't know what's come over
			me. Why don't you sit down and let me get you some more coffee?" She picked up the
			empty cups and bustled past them. "Ronnie, you shouldn't let her stand like that for
			so long." The executive immediately complied, helping Rose into her chair. "I
			think I just got yelled at," she whispered into the young woman's ear.</p>
		<p>"I think you did too," came the reply. "You'd better sit down."</p>
		<p>"Good idea." A quick peck to the cheek and Ronnie took her seat. Maria
			returned with the coffees and smiled pleasantly at Rose, dispelling the young woman's
			worries. "Here you go, dear."</p>
		<p>"Thank you."</p>
		<p>"Well, I think we'll take these out to the living room and leave Maria
			alone," Ronnie said as she rose to her feet. "Rose do you know which tape has
			those two roommates arguing over the two thousand dollar phone bill?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I think I do. You didn't see that one yet?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Then you missed a good one, Ronnie," the housekeeper chimed in. "Those
			two fools showed up dressed like they were going to one of those punk rock concerts with
			their bodies all pierced and green hair."</p>
		<p>"Oh yes, that was awful, wasn't it?" Rose agreed. "And the blonde one
			with that thing on her tongue?ewww." The young woman shuddered at the thought.
			"I can understand piercing ears but tongues and eyebrows?"</p>
		<p>"And their mothers let them appear on national television like that," Maria
			tsked as she followed them into the living room. "And I thought some of the outfits
			on Jerry Springer were bad."</p>
		<p>"You should have heard the way Judge Judy yelled at them," Rose added.
			"I think it's on the tape marked Tuesday." She settled onto the couch while
			Maria pushed the recliner into a better position to view the television and settled into
			it. Ronnie put the tape in and turned to take her lover up on the offer of cuddling all
			day when she saw the housekeeper sitting there. Noting Rose's position on one end of the
			couch, she did likewise, lowering the snack tray down between them to put the coffee cups
			on. The opening credits started and Ronnie tucked her feet up under herself, leaning her
			elbow against the arm of the couch. As the litigants each explained why they weren't
			responsible for the bill, blue eyes looked over at Maria. The older woman was focused on
			the case and didn't notice when one long leg straightened out until the toes pressed
			against Rose's hip. The move earned her a quizzical look from the young woman but Ronnie
			merely wiggled one dark eyebrow and turned her head back toward the television. Trying
			hard not to smirk, Ronnie continued to run her toes over the side of Rose's thigh and hip.
			Apparently she became too frisky because the young woman's hand clamped down on the
			wandering foot and held it still. Ronnie almost pulled back but then felt the gentle touch
			of Rose's thumb stroking back and forth against the ball of her foot. She made no move to
			protest when she felt her sock being pulled slowly off. As the best magistrate since Judge
			Wapner continued to berate the litigants, Ronnie found herself receiving one of the best
			foot massages Rose had ever given her. </p>
		<p>The case ended and another one began. Curious, Ronnie pulled her right leg back and
			stretched out her left, pleased when she felt delicate hands remove that sock as well. She
			rolled onto her back, using the arm of the leather couch as a pillow. Soon that foot was
			receiving the same loving touch and Ronnie decided she could care less who won and lost on
			the television show. Closing her eyes, she focused on Rose's fingers against her skin and
			the relaxed feeling they were creating. The minutes ticked by as that episode ended and
			another one began. Maria stood up and spoke, breaking Ronnie's trance. "I have to get
			back to work here. Rose, you're going to spoil her if you keep that up."</p>
		<p>"Hey, don't give away all my secrets," the executive lazily protested.</p>
		<p>"That's okay, Maria. I'll just remind her of this the next time I want my feet
			rubbed." She patted the feet resting on her lap. "But right now I need to visit
			the little girl's room."</p>
		<p>"But I'm comfy," Ronnie said, wiggling her toes.</p>
		<p>"You won't be comfy if there's suddenly a large wet spot right here."</p>
		<p>"Fine, I need another cup of coffee anyway." She sat up and handed Rose the
			crutches, taking a kiss as payment. "Mmm, when you come back we'll put the snack tray
			up and cuddle, how's that sound?" Ronnie decided to show off some of the benefits of
			being close by nibbling the soft skin of her lover's neck. "Hmm? You, me, a soft
			leather couch."</p>
		<p>"Behave, Maria's still here, you know." She allowed one more kiss before
			moving away. "Can you get me some more too, please?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, Hon."</p>
		<p>Ronnie was just returning to the living room when she heard Rose call out for her.
			Setting the cups down on the coffee table, she entered the room to see what her lover
			needed. "I'm right here, Rose. What do you need?"</p>
		<p>"Could you bring me a pair of undies?" the clearly embarrassed voice on the
			other side of the bathroom door asked.</p>
		<p>"Why? What's?oh."
			<i>Damn. </i>"Okay, wait right there. I'll get
			it." Ronnie tried to keep the disappointment out of her voice as she walked over to
			the dresser.
			<i>Of all the times for her to get her period,</i> she mused, pulling out a
			pair of sensible white cotton briefs from the drawer. She entered the bathroom to find a
			clearly embarrassed Rose sitting on the toilet, the soiled panties already rinsed out and
			waiting to go into the wash.
		</p>
		<p>"Of all the times to be a woman," Rose said as she took the clean pair. She
			did her best to smile. "I guess the timing's lousy, huh?"</p>
		<p>"It happens," Ronnie replied. "How's the pants?"</p>
		<p>"I don't think I got them." A quick check confirmed her statement. "I'll
			be out in a few minutes."</p>
		<p>"Take your time." Ronnie leaned down and kissed her lover's forehead.
			"Don't worry about it, Rose. It's what?four, five days tops? We'll
			survive."</p>
		<p>"Four or five days." The young woman repeated the words as if they were a
			death sentence. Her eyes flickered at her lover and an idea formed in her mind. "You
			know, just because I have it doesn't mean?"</p>
		<p>"Yes it does. I want it to be mutual," Ronnie said firmly, despite what her
			body was telling her.</p>
		<p>"But?"</p>
		<p>"No buts. We can wait until then." Seeing the look on Rose's face, she knelt
			down and hooked the small chin with her fingers. "Hey, look at me. I've waited years
			for you. A few more days isn't going to kill me." She let her finger travel down the
			delicate throat and to the vee formed by Rose's shirt. "I love you." She stood
			up and retrieved the soiled garment. "I'll run this out to Maria so it can be washed
			right away while you finish up in here."</p>
