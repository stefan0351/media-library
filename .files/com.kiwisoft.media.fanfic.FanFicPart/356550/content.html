<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 10 -->

<p>Countess Hela sat in the throne room of her temporary home humming a
happy demented little tune. Her spies had brought her a report of the
ambush that fool Kresis' people had attempted, it failed as usual. All
her carefully laid plans were progressing nicely. </p>

<p>She'd very nearly had the Slayer that last time, but the little
witch-kit had interfered, but it wouldn't be long now. With Willow
draining her powers to the point of collapse she wouldn't be able to
interfere next time. </p>

<p>"I think I'll take a peek at my two little targets." the demoness hissed
happily. "Maybe I'll be able to drive the wedge between them even
further now that she's weakened." </p>

<p>Helas only worry was the source of the unknown power that had rescued
the two from last nights ambush. She cursed herself for not being there
to watch over her future pets. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;It simply wouldn't do to have Kresis take them after all I've invested
in their capture.&lt;&gt; she scolded herself. &lt;&gt;No that wouldn't do at all.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>With this thought in mind the powerful demoness began to carefully
recite the spell that created the scrying sphere. As the glowing red
ball appeared, Hela decided to enter the Slayers id to wreak even
further havoc with the young sensitive girls sanity. </p>

<p>As the vision of the two sleeping lovers came into focus. She cackled as
she fed off of the innocence displayed by her unaware victims. Once the
picture was clear Hela sent forth a tentacle of power to stealthily worm
its way into the Slayers subconscious to exploit the naive childs
undeserved guilt. </p>

<p>"This is fun!" the living embodiment of evil mumbled to herself, as she
anticipated the torture she was about to inflict on Buffys mind. "It
won't be long till she's mine completely, and there's nothing the
witch-kit can do about it." </p>

<p>Her maniacal laughter filled the air as Hela pushed her power harder
into the unknowing mind of the pure innocent girl. </p>

<p>It was nearly time for the Slayer to feel the full weight of Helas
ability to destroy her will and learn the true meaning of submission.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Giles was in his study his nose buried deep in some ancient tome when he
heard Buffy crying out. He bolted from his chair and charged into the
living room ready to face, and defeat whatever evil was attacking his
Slayer. </p>

<p>For the first time he saw the eerie glow that surrounded the girls as
they slept recuperating from a hard night. </p>

<p>Buffy was tossing her head from side to side and begging someone to
forgive her for something. </p>

<p>As she begged the glow around her began to change from neon green to a
sickly reddish yellow.
The stain spread across the Slayers half of the protective glow very
nearly covering her completely. </p>

<p>Giles was unable to move as he watched the evil looking glow spreading
and Buffy becoming more and more agitated. He knew he should do
something but for some reason he couldn't move or speak. </p>

<p>He was paralysed and helpless as he watched the attack on his surrogate
daughter progressed unabated. Never in his entire life had the
ex-watcher and teacher felt so completely useless. Giles felt nothing
but contempt for himself and the weakness in himself that was powerless
to aid the two people that depended on him to protect them. </p>

<p>Just as the sickly looking glow was about to engulf Buffy completely,
Giles heard Willow mumbling something in her sleep. </p>

<p>"A'nal Na'thrak U'thas Bet'hard Dan'nal Vein'dah." </p>

<p>Giles had no idea what it meant but Willow began chanting it over and
over again. </p>

<p>"A'nal Na'thrak U'thas Bet'hard Dan'nal Vien'dah." </p>

<p>He saw the glow on Willows side of the glow growing brighter each time
she uttered the phrase. Her voice got louder and stronger each time she
repeated the words until it reached its peak. </p>

<p>"A'NAL NA'THRAK U'THAS BET'HARD DAN'NAL VIEN'DAH DAR'GA SAR'ETHA!" </p>

<p>There was a sudden bright flash of light from Willows side of the
surrounding glow, the stain was gone and Buffy was once more sleeping
peacefully. </p>

<p>Giles realized he had just witnessed a mystical attack on them while
they slept, and even more interestingly Willows successful defence
against it. </p>

<p>It was then he realized the seriousness of the mystic threat they faced.
He knew now that they faced a far greater evil than they'd faced before
because there were two of them. </p>

<p>One was coming at them head on meeting them in battle supporting the
dark forces that were attacking them directly. </p>

<p>However, the one he'd just seen was sly and cunning more subtle and
quite possibility far more dangerous. </p>

<p>Giles knew he should hurry and get on the phone to call reinforcements,
but for a few moments all he could do was stare at the small red haired
witch snuggled up against her lover. </p>

<p>He shook his head in wonder at how someone so sweet and innocent could
wield such great power. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;She really has no idea how powerful she truly is.&lt;&gt; he thought
chuckling. &lt;&gt;She has just used an ancient spell from the book that
neither one of us has been able to translate yet, even with Angels help,
and she just used it to protect Buffy in her sleep. Fascinating.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Breaking out of his thoughts Giles got into his roll-a-dex, and began
making calls. They were going to need all the help they could get.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Countess Hela had finally reached the Slayers sleeping subconscious and
was beginning to manipulate the humans dreams. </p>

<p>"This is almost too easy." she cackled to herself. "Kresis wears them
down, and distracts the little witch-kit while I sneak in the back door,
take control of the Slayer, and then through her the little witch-kit." </p>

<p>Watching her intended victim in the glowing red sphere that hovered in
front of her. Hela could feel her magic fingers reaching deep into the
hidden recesses of her preys mind, prying out her deepest secrets and
her darkest fears, bringing them to the surface. Forcing them into her
dreams to torture, and torment the Slayer weakening her defences. Until
Hela could bend the Slayers will to her own. </p>

<p>Suddenly, just as Hela was about to once again take control of the
Slayers subconscious, another force struck out at her. She wasn't sure
where this other power came from but it was stronger than any Hela had
encountered before in this world. It smashed into her own probing magic
power and blew back at her, causing her viewing sphere to explode in a
blinding flash of greenish white light. </p>

<p>The power released by the backlash lifted the demoness off her feet and
threw her across the room into a wall. Hela slid down the wall stunned
by the force that had just hit her. The power released by the blast
shook the entire house. </p>

<p>For the first time in her life Hela knew true fear. She was facing an
unknown factor that was so powerful it had swatted her back like she was
an insignificant insect. </p>

<p>From her brief contact with this power she knew its wielder was female
and she was not of the Darkness. Oh no, this powerful mage was most
decidedly on the side of Light, automatically making her an enemy to be
reckoned with, and Hela had just lost her first battle with it. </p>

<p>Her screams of rage echoed throughout the house, many of the beings
staying there did not live through the day.
The lucky ones.</p>
