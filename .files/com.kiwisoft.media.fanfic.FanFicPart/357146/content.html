<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 3: Adapting and Making Changes-->

<p>Buffy and Willow were in Cordelia’s car, holding on, as she drove past Sunnydale’s border. Willow was sitting in the passenger seat; Buffy was in the back.</P>
<p>"Remind me again why we’re driving out of town just to go get Willow’s hair cut." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Because the only stylist in Sunnydale is in the mall, and everyone who goes there looks like their hair was struck by lightning. Trust me. My hair dresser is the best."</P>
<p>"All I wanted to do was get an inch and a half off." Willow said.</P>
<p>"We’re all agreed that I know fashion right?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"Yep." They both said.</P>
<p>"So I know you would look good with your hair short. Shoulder length with highlights. Besides the cut’s free."</P>
<p>"But –" Willow started to protest.</P>
<p>Buffy put her hand on Willow’s shoulder. Instantly, Willow calmed down.</P>
<p>"If it doesn’t turn out the way you want it to, I’ll knock her out, okay?"</P>
<p>Willow smiled and nodded. Cordelia sighed.</P>
<p>"Xander would never do that for me."</P>
<p>They all started laughing.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy was walking towards her front porch. Cordelia was going to drop Willow off. Willow, to her surprise, was very pleased with her new haircut. She thought it made her look more mature. Buffy couldn’t believe that that was all she said. Laughing slightly, she realized that Willow really didn’t know how beautiful she was.</P>
<p>She was most certainly attractive. Even the first day Buffy saw her at school, she thought Willow was attractive. Of course at the time she didn’t pay it much mind.</p>
<p>Willow’s lack of self-confidence made her feel ugly, so she hid behind clothes that looked something like catholic school uniforms. And Buffy thought that was such a shame. She knew that if Willow had just been less afraid, had just a little more confidence, guys would have been lining up to ask her out. Of course in an ideal world Willow shouldn’t have to change her look to get a date, but Buffy knew two things.</p>
<p>The world wasn’t in any way ideal, and guys were shallow and superficial.</P>
<p>But Willow had grown by leaps and bounds since that first year she had met her. And it might not have been a big deal to Buffy, but she knew that Willow’s new haircut was a big step for her. And Buffy was proud to have been a part of helping her grow. Of being in her life the way she was.</P>
<p>As she opened the door to her house, she felt better than she had in a long time. She had no worries whatsoever. Well, that was until she saw her mom with her arms crossed waiting for her.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Where have you been?" Joyce asked.</P>
<p>Before Buffy responded, she looked out the window.</P>
<p><I>‘Yep, still daylight. So what’d I do now?’</I></P>
<p>"Cordelia and I took Willow to get her hair cut. I was just going to go back out -"</P>
<p>"So you weren’t…slaying?"</P>
<p>"Umm, no. See the sunshine?"</P>
<p>Joyce looked at her daughter, and walked into the kitchen. Buffy, confused, walked after her.</P>
<p>"What’d I say?"</P>
<p>Joyce sighed.</P>
<p>"You just expect me to accept this whole situation and move on?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. I don’t see what’s so hard to understand."</P>
<p>"Well the fact that my seventeen year old daughter has been fighting," Joyce paused, still not believing, "vampires, for the past three years…"</P>
<p>"I get that this is hard for you…"</P>
<p>"I don’t think you get it at all, Buffy. Every night you’ve been risking your life, while I’ve been kept in the dark."</P>
<p>"To prevent conversations like this."</P>
<p>"I am your mother. I’m sorry if you don’t like telling me about your life, but I think I have a right to know."</P>
<p>"I was doing it to protect you. It’s too dangerous if people know. Especially you."</P>
<p>"Then why do your friends know? Aren’t you risking their lives?"</P>
<p>"I didn’t have a choice. They…found out on they’re own. Look, I’m sorry this is hard for you, but no matter how many conversations we have, it doesn’t change what I have to do. I know it’s dangerous, but right now, I’m the only one who can do it."</P>
<p>"What do you mean right now? If there’s a way you can stop, do it."</P>
<p>"You want me to die?"</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"My death is the only way this is over. So do you want a daughter who is alive and has to worry about saving the world, or a daughter who’s dead and doesn’t have anything to worry about ever again?"</P>
<p>"Oh my God…"</P>
<p>Joyce took Buffy into her arms.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry. I had no idea. I don’t want you to die."</P>
<p>"I didn’t either."</p>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"N…nothing."</P>
<p>"It’s just…I don’t know what to say, to do. The school librarian knows you better than I do."</P>
<p>"It’s not his fault. You almost gave him a heart attack. Listen. I’ll try and help you understand what I have to do, but you have to trust me. If you really wanna get to know me, just start paying attention. That’s all I ask."</P>
<p>Joyce wished she could’ve gotten angry at that last remark, but she couldn’t. She knew she hadn’t been that involved in her daughter’s life for a long time now. She hugged her again.</P>
<p>"Do you have any more surprises?"</P>
<p>Buffy quickly thought it over. If she told her now, she was pretty sure her mom would collapse. No, now wasn’t the right time.</P>
<p>"Nope."</P>
<p>"So…do you have any plans tonight?"</P>
<p>"Not really. I was gonna run by Mr. Giles’ house, and then I was going to go meet everybody at the Bronze."</P>
<p>"When you see Mr. Giles, tell him that I’m sorry, and that I’d like to talk with him when he gets time, okay?"</P>
<p>"Sure."</P>
<p>"I was going to rent a movie later. If you want, when you come home, we could, um, watch it…if you want."</P>
<p>"Yeah. That’d be nice."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled at her mom. She started to go out the door, when she realized she forgot supplies.</P>
<p><I>‘Just in case.’</I></P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles was sitting on his sofa reading a book and drinking tea. His two favorite things to do. It wasn’t often that he was able to relax, so he intended to take full advantage of it. It had been a difficult summer for him.</P>
<p>There hadn’t been any "dire end of the world" situations. No, summers were usually quiet. He was tortured for hours by Angelus. That was the difficulty. His injuries, by treatment standards, weren’t that extensive. His chest and sides had been bruised, and two fingers were broken. And it all healed pretty well since then.</P>
<p>But the mental stress he endured was hard to get over. Angelus was a definite master of mental torture, and even though Giles had read all about his methods, he wasn’t prepared for it. In fact, one the primary lessons for a Watcher-In-Training was how to survive all types of torture.</P>
<p>And he had been doing well, until Druscilla came into the room. She had used his memories against him. Made him think Jenny was there, and he told her, basically, how to end the world. At that moment, he felt horrible grief. For Jenny, and for Buffy. He had let her down.</P>
<p>He didn’t feel he deserved it, but she had saved him. Sacrificed her love to keep the world turning. When she did that, any anger he had felt towards her for Jenny’s death evaporated. He had even felt guilt for blaming her, and he was prepared to support her in any way that he could.</P>
<p>But surprisingly, he hadn’t needed to. She had been happier than he had ever seen her, and she wouldn’t tell him why. But he enjoyed seeing her happy again, whatever the reason might be.</p>
<p><I>‘She’ll be here any minute.’</I></P>
<p>She had been coming by two nights a week since the beginning of the summer. At first it had been just to check in on any rising demonic activity, but it had become something they both looked forward to. They would just sit and talk about their lives. He would talk about Jenny, his life before a Watcher, and she would talk about her mom, Angel, her dad, and whatever else happened to come up.</P>
<p>It had made them both feel better. They were very similar, and they hadn’t realized it before. There was a knock at the door, and Giles got up and smiled. He opened the door.</P>
<p>"Hey Giles."</P>
<p>"Hello Buffy."</P>
<p>She walked in and sat down, and he shut the door.</P>
<p>"Oh before I forget, my mom says she’s sorry and she wants to talk to you. Without screaming."</P>
<p>"Yes I have to admit I was unprepared for that voice level. I wasn’t aware that it was possible for someone to get that loud. And angry."</P>
<p>"It’s a trait of Summers’ women."</P>
<p>"Yes, and now I know where you get it from."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled, and looked at his hand.</P>
<p>"How are they coming along?"</P>
<p>"Quiet nicely actually. There’s still some discomfort, but in a week or so it should be fine."</P>
<p>"That’s good."</P>
<p>Buffy paled.</P>
<p>"What is it?"</P>
<p>"School starts in a week!"</P>
<p>"Oh, it does doesn’t it?"</P>
<p>Buffy nodded.</P>
<p>"I feel sick."</P>
<p>"I really don’t understand why children have such a strong dislike towards learning."</P>
<p>"Me neither. We just do."</P>
<p>"That reminds me. Stay alert. It has been a quiet summer, but if the vampires follow their pattern, they’ll come out in force for an attack before the start of school."</P>
<p>"Who would have thought vamps have back to school blues? Don’t worry. I brought supplies with me."</P>
<p>"May I ask you a question, Buffy?"</P>
<p>"Sure."</P>
<p>"I’ve noticed you’ve been very cheerful, and I have no idea why. Don’t misunderstand me, I’m glad you’re back to your old self again, but I would have figured…"</P>
<p>"That I would have been mopey?"</P>
<p>"To say the least."</P>
<p>"Well…"</P>
<p>"If you don’t wish to –"</P>
<p>"No, there’s no reason for me not to. It’s not bad or anything. At first, though, I was mopey. I was going to leave, live on my own, but I didn’t."</P>
<p>Giles was shocked. In all their talks they had had over the summer, this had never come up.</P>
<p>"But two things stopped me. One – Angel."</P>
<p>"Angel?"</P>
<p>"I don’t know how to explain it, but he came to me just as I was ready to leave. He said he wasn’t in Hell, he was upstairs."</P>
<p>"Upstairs?" He thought a moment. "Oh, upstairs."</P>
<p>"He said that he was okay, told me not to feel guilty, and convinced me to stay."</P>
<p>"And the second thing?"</P>
<p>"Willow."</P>
<p>Giles showed his confusion.</P>
<p>"I realized something when she was in the hospital."</P>
<p>"Oh?"</P>
<p>"I love her."</P>
<p>Giles let it sink in, and then he smiled. He saw Buffy waiting for his reaction.</P>
<p>"I’m not surprised."</P>
<p>"You’re not?"</P>
<p>"Should I be?"</P>
<p>"Well, it’s kind of a change for me. I thought you would’ve had a stronger reaction."</P>
<p>"I believe that if you have found love, same gender or no, and you’re happy, my only reaction is happiness for you and Willow. Have you told your mother?"</P>
<p>"Giles, think about that."</P>
<p>"Yes, that would probably be a bad idea. But both you and Willow have laid a foundation of friendship that helped you get to this point. I’ve seen you two both help each other and grow closer. I’d think your mother would be accepting of this."</P>
<p>"Well it is Willow. How could you not accept her? But there’s also my choice in relationships. A vampire, and now another girl. And considering she still can’t deal with Angel…"</P>
<p>"I’d think she’d be pleased you had a relationship with a human being."</P>
<p>"Very funny, Giles."</P>
<p>"I try."</P>
<p>"Well I have to book. I’m meeting the gang at the Bronze."</P>
<p>"If there’s any trouble –"</P>
<p>"I’ll send one of the guys to come get you.  Thanks, Giles."</P>
<p>"You’re welcome. And congratulations."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Guess what?" Buffy asked the gang around the table at the Bronze. Greeted with blank stares, she told them. "School starts in a week!"</P>
<p>A collective groan was heard.</P>
<p>"I’m looking forward to it." Willow said.</P>
<p>"You always look forward to it, Will." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Yeah everybody knows you’re the teenage version of Giles." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"I’m serious. We’ll be seniors. The kings, or in my gender’s case, queens, of the school."</P>
<p>"Yeah. You’ve got the look for it too." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Love the new do." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Told you." Buffy whispered to Willow.</P>
<p>Willow blushed.</P>
<p>"Wanna dance?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"You bet." Buffy responded.</P>
<p>Willow had butterflies in her stomach as she and Buffy walked out to the dance area. It was a slow song, and they were going to be with other couples. Male/female couples.</P>
<p>They regarded one another a moment and then Willow put her arms around Buffy’s neck, and Buffy put her arms around Willow’s. To Willow’s surprise, no one seemed to pay much attention to them. She didn’t know if that was because it didn’t bother them or if they were afraid of what Buffy would do to them, but she didn’t care.</P>
<p>She relaxed, and smiled.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back at the table, the gang just watched Buffy and Willow dance.</P>
<p>"They sure are happy." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Especially Buffy. I haven’t seen her this happy since –" Xander started.</P>
<p>"Well, it’s gotta be nice when you’re in a relationship where your partner isn’t a demon. Kind of eliminates the fear aspect. Plus, there’re no secrets. They know each other." Oz said.</P>
<p>"And Angel had lots of secrets." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Plus a tendency toward rage and viol ence. I never could figure out why you two couldn’t get along, Xander." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"What’s that supposed to mean?"</P>
<p>"Nothing."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"So you really like the hair?"</P>
<p>"For the last time, yes. You’re beautiful."</P>
<p>Willow blushed. She looked at Buffy, who seemed concerned about something.</P>
<p>"Buffy?"</P>
<p>"What? Oh. Sorry. I had an exhausting argument with mom earlier. But I think we’re getting better."</P>
<p>"It wasn’t about us, was it?"</P>
<p>"No, I’m trying to avoid that as long as possible. Have you -?"</P>
<p>"Are you kidding? No way. I like the way things are now. Once I tell my parents, it’ll complicate things."</P>
<p>"Ain’t that the truth."</P>
<P>Buffy looked over to her right, and pulled Willow closer.</P>
<p>"Vamp, 3:00 o’clock. Act natural."</P>
<p>"This is natural to you?" Willow smiled.</P>
<p>"The most natural thing in the world. Let’s start moving over to the table."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The gang looked at Buffy and Willow as they ‘danced’ back towards the table. Willow’s back was to them, but they could see Buffy. She mouthed, ‘vampire’, and they all nodded. It was about to get messy.</P>
<p>As they heard the vampire growl, they started to get up to open the doors.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>When Buffy and Willow heard the vampire growl, they pulled apart.</P>
<p>"Get to the others and help them ge t t he other people out."</P>
<p>"But…"</P>
<p>"Go. I’ll be okay. I promise."</P>
<p>Willow nodded reluctantly, as a rush of people came running by. Buffy turned around to face the vampire, and pulled a stake out of her jacket.</P>
<p>"You’re it?" She asked.</P>
<p>"Not quite."</P>
<p>As the vampire said that, six of his buddies dropped down onto the stage.</P>
<p><I>‘Damn. I forgot about the skylight in the roof.’</I></P>
<p>"Let’s go, Slayer."</P>
<p>"You know what I hate?" Buffy said as she round-housed the vampire in the head, "Being rushed." The vampire fell, and Buffy looked to the stage. The three members of the night’s band were struggling against the six vampires who were trying to get a snack.</P>
<p>She ran up to the stage, and grabbed the vampire nearest to her. She threw him off the stage, and directly into the vampire she had knocked down a minute ago. Buffy quickly surveyed the situation. Everyone but the band was out of the Bronze. That was good.</P>
<p>Noticing the absence of their friend, the other five vampires focused their attention on Buffy.</p>
<p>"Get out!" She yelled to the three guys huddled in the corner.</P>
<p>Not needing to be told twice, they ran backstage, and out the back door. Now Buffy was alone. With seven angry vampires, and an even less number of stakes.</P>
<p>"Okay. Now what?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Outside of the Bronze, the last of the people that were inside, were running home. Willow didn’t like Buffy’s chances.</P>
<p>"Go get Giles." She said. "I’m going back in."</P>
<p>"You could – Oz and I will go in. You go with Cordy and get Giles." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Go get Giles." Willow said evenly.</P>
<p>That was the end of the discussion. Willow picked up a pole that was lying against the side of building, and opened the side door.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy rammed her stake right through the vampire closest to her.</p>
<p><I>‘Six to go. Why’d I forget Mr. Pointy?’</I></P>
<p>She leaped over her enemies, and back down to the ground. She grabbed a cue off of a pool table, and slammed it into the oncoming vampire. She jumped on top of the pool table to get higher as the five who were left started to surround her.</P>
<p>She kicked them down.</P>
<p><I>‘As fun as this is, I really need a more permanent solution.’</I></P>
<p>From behind her she heard a door open. She turned around just in time to see Willow toss her a long, metal pole. It might just keep them off her long enough for her to get out. As she hopped down off the table, she connected with the pole on the top of a female one’s head. It dropped.</P>
<p>Buffy suddenly remembered the stake hidden in her sleeve, took it out, and dusted the she-vamp before it could get up. She swung the pole like a bat, momentarily knocking all the vampires down. She ran towards the door and Willow.</P>
<p>"What are you doing here?" Buffy panted.</P>
<p>"Helping you."</P>
<p>"Thanks."</P>
<p>"I sent the guys to get Giles. He should be here with more weapons." Willow said as she tried the door.</P>
<p>"What is it?"</P>
<p>"It’s stuck."</P>
<p>Buffy looked at the vampires approaching, and handed Willow the pole. She started kicking the door. Willow remembered something.</P>
<p>"Ooh! I have holywater." She said reaching into her pants pocket.</P>
<p>"Use it!"</P>
<p>Just as Willow threw the bottle at the vampires, the door slammed open. Buffy grabbed Willow by the hand, and they ran outside.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>As soon as they emerged from the Bronze, they saw Giles and their friends. Giles had a crossbow, and Mr. Pointy. Two vampires came running out first, and Giles aimed. It sliced through both, turning them to ashes. He handed Buffy Mr. Pointy, and she ran to the door.</P>
<p>Standing to the left of the door, she waited until the last two came out. They came out one by one this time. She pulled the first one off to the side, and dispatched him quickly. The other one was a little bit smarter, and was able to knock Buffy off her feet.</P>
<p>The gang rushed over. Willow got there first, and pulled the vampire back. As the vampire turned on her, Buffy shot up from behind and grabbed it by the neck. She tossed Mr. Pointy to Willow.</P>
<p>"Would you like to do the honors, Will?"</P>
<p>Willow grinned, and with dead on accuracy, staked the vampire. Buffy hugged Willow immediately.</P>
<p>"Thanks for saving my life in there."</P>
<p>"I didn’t –"</P>
<p>"Yes you did. I’d be dead if it wasn’t for you."</P>
<p>Buffy turned to Giles.	</P>
<p>"Don’t you hate being right?"</P>
<p>"Yes, actually."</P>
<p>They all started to walk home.</P>
<p>"I’d say that this unofficially marks the end of summer." Xander said.</P>
<p>"I’d have to agree with you, Xand. I’d say we’re in for another horror-filled school year." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"But at least it’ll be the last horror-filled school year." Willow said optimistically.</P>
<p>Buffy moved closer to Willow. God, she loved her optimism.</P>
<p>"True." Oz said.</P>
<p>"It really doesn’t mean anything though. After this it’s on to horror-filled college years." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>Everybody frowned.</P>
<p>"And once again you manage to destroy the silver lining in the cloud, Cordelia." Giles said.</P>
<p>Cordelia looked at him unbelievingly, and everyone laughed.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy told Willow that she and her mom were going to watch a movie at her house, and invited her to watch it with them. By the time they all settled down on the couch to watch it, it was late, but they tried to keep their eyes open.</P>
<p>About half- way through, Buffy and Willow were sound asleep on the couch, Buffy’s head on the end of the sofa, and Willow’s head on Buffy’s shoulder. Her arm was draped around Willow’s body.</p>
<p>Joyce looked over at them from the chair she was sitting in, and smiled. She got up, and put a blanket around them. She shut off the TV, and started to go upstairs. Halfway up, she turned around and looked down at them.</P>
<p>"She’ll tell me when she’s ready."</P>
<p>With that, Joyce went to bed.</P>
