<!-- Telling Series \ Section 2: Lily & Josh - Pick A Card, Any Card -->

<p>"So, who do we tell next?" Brooke asked, as she lay sprawled
out next to Sam on Sam's bed exploring the girl's warm skin with her hands. They
were supposed to be doing homework but weren't getting much actual work done.
Sam turned her head and stared at her with a horrified look on her face.
</p>
<p>"What the Hell are you asking me for? I thought we'd just stay
quiet for a little while longer. Hee hee stop that it tickles," she scolded as
Brooke ran her fingernails over Sam's sides and watched as the highly ticklish
girl (who knew?) squirmed on the bed. She half-heartedly tried to bat the
questing hands away but was sadly unsuccessful. </p>
<p>"Can't stay quiet forever, Sammy. I think Nic is getting
suspicious," Brooke whispered as she leaned in to kiss Sam's neck. She felt Sam
giggle. </p>
<p>"Nicole is always suspicious of something," Sam pointed out.
Brooke nodded before going back to Sam's neck and other explorations. Sam had a
point. (If Nic ever gave up being a super bitch, she'd have a great career in
the CIA. Or maybe she can do both) </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam's voice shook Brooke out of the lascivious haze
she was happily settling into and she picked her head up to look into the dark
brown eyes of her lover. Eyes that told her she wasn't taking the trip to
lustville alone. </p>
<p>"Yeah?" she asked throatily. Sam swallowed and gave her a
lopsided smile. </p>
<p>"Math homework?" she held up the text to illustrate her point.
Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"Biology homework," she answered slightly annoyed at the
interruption before returning to kissing Sam's collarbone and the annoying
process of unbuttoning Sam's shirt. She heard Sam moan, and then saw out of the
corner of her eye as the brunette grabbed a pillow and proceeded to try and
smother herself with it. Shrugging it off as a `Sam' thing, Brooke finished with
the shirt and was about to continue downward when Sam suddenly sat up and pushed
away, using the pillow as a barrier. </p>
<p>"OK, Brooke, as much as I would absoluely LOVE for you to
continue," she said, trying to get her ragged breathing under control and ignore
the hungry look on Brooke's face. (Why do I have to be the rational one?)
</p>
<p>"Mom and Mike are downstairs. Do you want to explain the cries
of pure unadulterated pleasure and bliss coming from this room, from the two of
US to your father tonight?" Sam watched nervously as Brooke licked her lips
instead of answering. </p>
<p>(Might be worth it, Sammy) Brooke considered silently. Since
they'd finally consumated their relationship after she'd returned from Nevada
with her father, their relationship had gotten stronger, just like Sam had
predicted. And it wasn't just about sex, either. Sex was just a bonus, an added
reward to an already terrific relationship. They were close and getting closer
everyday. They talked about everything, even things neither had told another
living soul. It was like they learned something new about each other everyday
and it made them love the other more. But Sam was right, as much as Brooke
wanted her right now, the thought of telling her father was like a bucket of ice
water in her face, or on other choice parts of her anatomy. </p>
<p>"I hate it when you're right," Brooke growled, relinquishing
her hold on Sam's shirt. Sam made no effort to close it but put the pillow down
and gave Brooke a deep, passionate kiss. </p>
<p>"I think they might be going out to a movie later," she
confided. Brooke grinned evilly. "Either that or I might feel the need for a
late night shower." </p>
<p>"We are in the middle of an energy crisis, too. I should
shower with you, in the interest of conserving water, of course," Brooke
suggested. Sam rolled her eyes. They always ended up using more water than they
saved when they showered together. </p>
<p>"It's an energy crisis, Princess, not a drought." Brooke
pouted at her, which did nothing to help Sam's resolve. (God she looks sexy when
she pouts) </p>
<p>"Well, if you WANTED to shower alone," Sam kissed her again. </p>
<p>"Kidding, I was kidding. So, instead of actually doing our
homework, or making love, what was your question again?" Brooke went back to
tracing lazy circles on Sam's exposed abdomen as she thought. </p>
<p>"Who do we tell about us next? We certainly don't tell Dad, at
least not yet. I'm not ready for that. You?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Me neither. Still having wood chipper nightmares," Brooke
smacked her lightly on the stomach. "Nicole?" </p>
<p>"Uh-huh. As much as she claims to have a soul now, why bait
the beast with a bloody steak?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"Nice imagery," Sam chided. "I got it. Let's put everyone's
name in a hat and pull one out and that's who we tell." Brooke picked up her
head. </p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan," she agreed. They wrote down all their
friend's names down and put them in an old hat and after flipping a coin to see
who drew (Brooke won), pulled out a slip of paper. </p>
<p>"Well?" Sam asked anxiously. Brooke looked at her nervously. </p>
<p>"Lily and Josh," she read. They entered the two as one since
they were married. </p>
<p>"Oh," Sam said understanding Brooke's nervousness. She
wouldn't want to tell her ex-boyfriend she was now gay and in love with her
stepsister either. Thankfully George had moved away and she wouldn't have to.
Although she had no doubt once everyone else knew, the news would eventually
reach him anyway. </p>
<p>"So when do we tell them? How do we tell them?" Brooke asked.
Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Not at school, that's for sure. Why not after they get out of
work tomorrow?" </p>
<p>"OK," Brooke agreed slightly afraid. Sam hugged her against
her body. </p>
<p>"It'll be OK, Brooke. Lily is cool, she'll probably think this
is great for women everywhere and take Josh along with her. And even if it does
go south, you still have me, and I love you." </p>
<p>"I love you too, Sammy." </p>
