<p>.</p>
<p>Lilly was watching in near astonishment as her new friend pulled out a plastic bag filled with a variety of food. There were three sandwiches, a bag of crackers, some cookies, an apple and even two juice boxes. Miley smiled sheepishly as she spread her goods out in front of her. Lilly suddenly felt inadequate thinking about the jug of water and gum in her own backpack.</p>
<p>"That seems like a lot of food, even for a pregnant woman," said Lilly, eyeing the food that was divided into multiple ziplock bags, as if someone had put a lot of effort into it.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "I know. I don't even eat most of it, maybe some crackers or cookies. I just hide whatever's left when I get home."</p>
<p>She laughed at the end and Lilly looked at her weirdly. "You hide your food? Does your husband make it for you or something?"</p>
<p>Miley made a face and shook her head almost vehemently. "I'm not married. Oh wait, you're not gonna call me a heathen now, are you?"</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't tell whether the girl was joking or not, but judging by the suddenly almost panicked look on her face, she may have heard the accusation before. Lilly snorted, "I'm the last person to call anyone a heathen, trust me. I don't much care if you got pregnant out of wedlock. So, you live with your boyfriend then?"</p>
<p>She couldn't say why she was suddenly so talkative, when before she'd been trying just to get home. There was something about Miley that was friendly and warm and Lilly wanted to get to know her better. Miley shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, I live at home, with my dad and brother. My dad makes me all this food every day; he's just trying to take care of me and I don't have the heart to tell him I can't eat it all."</p>
<p>Though Miley smiled at the end Lilly wasn't sure whether she hadn't just stepped into a huge quagmire. She could only think of a few scenarios where a young pregnant woman would live at home without the father of her child and none of them seemed particularly happy. Perhaps Miley could read the hesitation mixed with curiosity on her face, because she gave Lilly an expectant look.</p>
<p>"You can ask; everyone else does."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not everyone else," said Lilly, almost defiantly. She did not want this girl to think ill of her, though she couldn't figure out why.</p>
<p>Miley smiled again. "Alright, well now that you know about me, I wanna hear all about who Lilly is."</p>
<p>Lilly suddenly felt nervous and made a face. "There's nothing special about me. I'm a Junior, majoring in Athletic Training. I live with my mother, I work at a crappy minimum wage job. That's it."</p>
<p>"I really doubt that's all there is to know about you. Do you have a boyfriend? Husband?"</p>
<p>Lilly snorted, almost shuddering at the thought, "None of the above. I'm gay. I do have a psychotic ex-girlfriend, though."</p>
<p>Lilly realized a split-second too late what she had said. She normally was very open about her sexuality, but that was because she didn't really care what people thought. For some reason, with Miley, she cared, though Lilly attributed it to the fact they were stuck in a confined space for what could turn into a long wait. Miley laughed at her words and Lilly really wished she hadn't said anything, until the other girl spoke.</p>
<p>"We make quite a pair, huh? The unwed, single mother and the lesbian. Maybe the elevator getting stuck was an act of God?"</p>
<p>Lilly smiled wryly, though she was enjoying the other girl's sense of humor. She had to admit to herself she was rather glad now she had held the elevator doors for Miley â€“ the girl made for great company. Lilly stretched out her legs in front of her and sighed at the uncomfortable position, but then thought about how much more uncomfortable this would be if she were pregnant and stayed silent.</p>
<p>"So, tell me about this psychotic ex-girlfriend," said Miley and reached for her bag of cookies. She took one out and handed the bag to Lilly, who didn't hesitate to take one. She was starving. "They're oatmeal raisin. I know most people don't like them, but dad insists on feeding me 'healthy'. I tried telling him a cookie's a cookie, but he won't hear it."</p>
<p>Lilly took a bite and threw Miley a grateful smile. "I like oatmeal raisin. Thanks, Miley. Your dad sounds like a really nice guy."</p>
<p>"He's the best. But you were gonna tell me about the psycho girlfriend."</p>
<p>"There's not much to tell to be honest. Joannie and I dated for like two years. We just sort of grew apart, especially with me working and going to school. We broke up and she didn't take it well. Now she calls me all the time and I think sometimes she stalks me."</p>
<p>"To be honest, I do kinda wish she were stalking you now," said Miley and Lilly gave her an odd look. "If she'd stalked you here maybe she would've heard the alarm."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed. "Good point. So, what about you?"</p>
<p>Miley looked at her, one eyebrow raised and a slight grin on her face. "I thought you were different?"</p>
<p>"I am, but now you know all about my psycho ex. I think it's only fair."</p>
<p>"Well, there's not much to tell, either. Jake and I had been dating on and off since High School. He was always kind of a pompous jerk and my dad and all my friends hated him. I don't know, I suppose I loved him and tried to stick it out. So, one little accident and a plus sign on a pregnancy test later and Jake hightailed it out of town."</p>
<p>Lilly gaped at her. She knew it happened all the time, but couldn't imagine why someone would leave this funny, warm and very beautiful girl, especially after getting her pregnant. "He just left you?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "The week after I told him. He said he got a part in a movie and had to go, but I can't imagine anyone hiring him he's so bad of an actor. So now it's just the baby and I, and my family."</p>
<p>"Do you know what it is, yet?"</p>
<p>"A baby, I hope," said Miley with a sly grin and Lilly rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"I meant the sex."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "I didn't wanna find out, especially cause it's driving everyone in my family mad."</p>
<p>"Not knowing the sex of the baby is driving your family mad?"</p>
<p>"They're very traditional people, who like to buy into all that gender role madness. They can't stand not knowing whether to buy pink or blue and I like frustrating them. They say I've been corrupted by 'all them California liberals'." Lilly had thought she'd heard an accent before, though hadn't paid it much mind, but Miley really laid it on thick for the last few words and Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Tennessee. The rest of the family still lives near Nashville; my dad, brother and I moved out here a few years ago. I really miss it sometimes, especially now with the baby coming. I'm sure I'll need all the help I can get," said Miley, her voice almost wistful at the end.</p>
<p>"When are you due?"</p>
<p>"December 15th. I know, I timed it perfectly for finals week," laughed Miley, rubbing her hands across her belly.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled. She normally felt horribly uncomfortable around pregnant women, but somehow Miley had put her completely at ease. "That's in like two weeks. Are you scared?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Yeah, I guess. I've heard too many stories not to be, but in the end I'll get to hold my son and it'll all be okay."</p>
<p>"I thought you didn't know the sex?"</p>
<p>"A mother just knows, Lilly," said Miley with a grin then made a face. "I'm sorry, that sounds horrible doesn't it? I always hated it when women would tell me that."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed, unable to argue with the other girl. She had always felt somewhat annoyed when women told her that particular phrase, but Miley was too nice to possibly draw Lilly's ire. They sat silently for a short while, sharing Miley's cookies, until the brunette made a face. Lilly looked at her, confused.</p>
<p>"Remember the bad news I told you about?" Lilly nodded, apprehensive. "Well, I think it's time. I really have to pee."</p>
<p>Lilly looked around them at the small elevator and back at Miley, no idea how the other girl was going to accomplish this.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>"What time is it?"</p>
<p>Lilly threw a glance at her watch and sighed. "Just after 1 am."</p>
<p>Miley had stretched out on her side of the elevator and was lying sideways against the wall, her head bedded on her backpack. Lilly was surprised there hadn't been a blanket or pillow stuffed into her bag, as well, though the girl had found a poncho to lie on. "My dad's probably going crazy with worry."</p>
<p>"Won't he know to look for you here?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, maybe. But they'll tow our cars once the parking garage closes and he may just think I left and never made it home." Miley's voice sounded almost teary at the end and Lilly turned towards her abruptly, sitting up.</p>
<p>"Hey, it's gonna be okay. We're gonna get out of here and you'll see your dad and everything will be fine." Lilly had never felt such a strong urge to comfort someone as she did with Miley. There was something vulnerable about the girl, though at the same time she seemed strong and confident.</p>
<p>Miley smiled at her, though Lilly saw the tears sparkling in her eyes. "I'm glad I'm stuck here with you. I mean, not that I'm stuck. That it's <b>you </b>I'm stuck with."</p>
<p>Lilly returned the smile and settled back against her own backpack pillow. She was exhausted, but the overhead lamps in the elevator could not be switched off. Thankfully it was warm enough inside, though the outside temperatures had dropped into the low 50s. Lilly hated the cold. She remembered the beanie she had in her backpack and rummaged for it until she found it triumphantly. Lilly was about to offer Miley the sweatshirt she kept in her backpack for warmth or eye cover, but one glance at the other girl told her she was already asleep. Lilly pulled the beanie over her eyes and laid back, dropping off to sleep not too much later.</p>
<p>When she awoke hours later she felt disoriented. Lilly pulled the beanie from her head and blinked at the bright lights. She turned and saw Miley sitting up against her backpack, a textbook in her hands. When she saw Lilly, she smiled and set down the book.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Lilly."</p>
<p>"What time is it?" asked Lilly, her voice heavy with sleep.</p>
<p>"Just after 7. You want a sandwich?" Miley held up one of the ziplock bags, but Lilly waved her off. She didn't want to take food from Miley and would try to hold out as long as she could.</p>
<p>Lilly sat up, straightening her clothes. She stretched, surprised she'd even managed to sleep for so long in this nasty elevator. "Do you always get up this early?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, rubbing her belly. "He likes to kick a lot and wake me up. I think he gets hungry."</p>
<p>She grimaced then and rubbed her hand over a certain spot. Lilly watched her, equal parts curious and terrified. "Is he kicking now?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I think he likes your voice. You wanna feel?"</p>
<p>Lilly was terrified by the thought, but slid closer nevertheless. Miley gave her that toothy grin again that for some reason made Lilly feel warm inside. She'd always found pregnant bellies to be somewhat scary, but when Miley took her hand and placed it on her abdomen, Lilly gasped in amazement. She had never expected it to feel like there was an actual baby inside, kicking her hand with a tiny foot where it lay. Miley smiled again.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I think he likes you."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled at the sensation of the baby poking her through Miley's stomach, but pulled her hand away once she fully realized how close she was to the other girl. Her face flushed and she looked away, almost embarrassed. Here this girl was being incredibly friendly and Lilly was getting butterflies. She shook her head, trying to shake off the feeling.</p>
<p>"Do you have a name picked out yet?" asked Lilly, reluctantly sliding back over to her own side.</p>
<p>"No, I was hoping one would just come to me when I see him. I really wanted to name my baby after my mom, but that's gonna be hard if it's a boy."</p>
<p>"What's your mom's name? Maybe you can make it sound male?" suggested Lilly.</p>
<p>"Her name was Susan, not much I can do with that I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"Was?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, she died almost ten years ago." Miley offered a sad smile and Lilly felt her insides churn.</p>
<p>"Wow, I'm really sorry, Miley. That must've been hard."</p>
<p>"It was, but my dad has been great and I'm glad he's around. I do wish I had my mom now, though, for baby advice. I swear, dad thinks I'm gonna break apart or something. Every time I just grimace he's ready to drive me to the hospital."</p>
<p>Lilly chuckled at the face Miley made. "Is it his first grandchild?"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I think we're both hoping my brother Jackson doesn't reproduce. Do you have any siblings?"</p>
<p>"No, it's just me. My parents are divorced; they've been dating other people but, thankfully, no little siblings."</p>
<p>They fell into a comfortable silence, with Miley returning to her textbook and Lilly rummaging through her backpack for anything else useful. She started shifting and crossing her legs and Miley threw her an odd look. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Lilly heaved a frustrated sigh, "I tried to hold it, but I've seriously got to pee."</p>
<p>Miley gave her a sympathetic grin and threw one of the empty ziplock bags at her. "Have at it. I promise I won't look."</p>
<p>Lilly gave the other girl a dark look and Miley laughed. Lilly knew she shouldn't complain, after all it was a lot easier for her to do this than hugely pregnant Miley and the other girl had, true to her word, had to pee almost every half hour. She'd devised the idea of relieving herself into a ziplock bag last night and had poured the contents down into the elevator shaft. It was somewhat disgusting, but it certainly beat them peeing into a corner. Lilly sighed, grabbed the little bag and turned, after making sure Miley wasn't looking.</p>
