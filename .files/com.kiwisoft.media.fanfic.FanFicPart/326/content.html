<!-- Moment by Moment \ 1.Awakening -->

<p>I don't know why I didn't see it coming.</p>

<p>I should have known that she was going to leave her chewed up
and spat out on the side of the road like so many other pieces of
road-kill left in her self-important, arrogant wake. But I didn't
want to see that possibility. I just wanted to see them both happy.</p>

<p>I should have known that with a harpy like Nicole
Julian, `happy' is a four-letter word.</p>

<p>Now she's all messed up and it's all Nic's fault and what
really gets me is that Nicole doesn't even care. She's PROUD of the
number she's done on her. Proud of the destruction and pain she's
wreaked. Like it was some sort of some sick contest to see who could
break her first. And damn her, Nicole just HAD to win.</p>

<p>Poor Sam. She's the one suffering in all this.</p>

<p>I barely see much of her anymore. She hardly ever comes out
of her room, even to eat dinner with me and the parentals. She only
goes to school because Mom forces her to, but I know it's hard for
Sam to face her tormentor day in and day out. Knowing that Nicole
mocks her not only behind her back but to her face as well has got to
be killing Sam, being as strong and proud as she is.</p>

<p>I've tried to reach out to her, get her to talk to me about
what's going on in that beautiful head of hers, behind the pain so
clearly etched in those deep brown eyes but, apparently I'm guilty by
association. Because Nicole was my friend, my `responsibility', this
whole mess is somewhat my fault as well. Even despite the fact that
I've publicly spurned Nicole and her friendship, Sam directs some of
her anger at me.</p>

<p>And that hurts?more than I dare let on.</p>

<p>God, I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe I should
backtrack to when this all started to go to Hell on the express train.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sam, beautiful sweet Sam dropped the bombshell on the family
one night at dinner. Granted, her `coming out' wasn't THAT huge a
shock to me. After all, I am her age, live across a bathroom with
her, go to the same school and basically can't avoid her even if I
wanted to. Which, by the way, in case you miss the obvious, I
don't. I have been acutely aware of all things `Sam' for some time
now. Her smile, her eyes (specifically the way they light up when
she's happy), her scent (slightly vanilla with a hint of something
unique), her curves, her?everything; are ingrained into my brain like
a much needed pattern. Her presence comforts me in some integral
way. Like, I didn't know that she was missing from my life until she
was in it.</p>

<p>Am I making ANY sense here? Doubtfully. Then again, I'm
blonde so I'm allowed pseudo-deep moments like these.</p>

<p>Anyway, Sam announced that she was gay, which to me was fine
although I'd been sitting on my bisexuality for a while. I saw no
reason to further rock the boat at that moment in time. My Dad
seemed to take it better than Mom did though. Jane looked like she
might be having difficulty breathing so we had to check on her. She
was OK, just in shock. I guess she'd never noticed anything amiss in
Sam's life that would have given her any indication. It's somewhat
disturbing that my father was more observant towards this than she
was. I mean, we're talking about a teenage girl whose bedroom walls
are covered with women, mostly. Melissa Etheridge, Selma Blair,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jodie Foster, Claudia Black, Gillian Anderson,
Brooke Burke, Shania Twain, Xena?Hello? Reality check, Mom. The
only non-female posters on Sam's walls had to do with Radiohead and
Dashboard Confessional.</p>

<p>Even I'm more subtle than Sam. (If you overlook that giant
Bring it On poster over my bed?*cough*)</p>

<p>There were some tears shed and then Jane went to bed early.
Sam looked a little lost but I assured her that Mom'd be OK in the
morning. She seemed to feel better after that. We talked for a long
time that night and I fell asleep in Sam's room, along side her on
the bed. I'm not ashamed or embarrassed to say it was one of the
best night's sleep I'd had in a long time. And it let Sam know that
our recent bonding as step-sisters to be wasn't at all affected by
her announcement.</p>

<p>In fact, I was feeling hopeful.</p>

<p>Maybe it was wrong of me but I was kind of hoping to slowly
approach Sam about the way I felt for her. Test the waters as it
were. Only, she jumped in with both feet and I ended up alone in the
boat.</p>

<p>I swear, Nicole made a beeline for Sam like a lion going for
a steak dipped in A1 sauce the second Sam told her friends at school
and word got out about her sexuality. I'd known about Nicole's
somewhat casual sexuality for a while, having pretty much had to beat
her off with my pom poms on more than one occasion. She's not so
much bisexual as `all' sexual. (Trust me, there's a difference) `If
it looks good and feels good, do it', is her personal motto. And
let's face it, Sam LOOKS good. No doubt about that.</p>

<p>So, she made a beeline for Sam. Do not pass `go'; do not
collect $200. She made no stops in between. Honest, I've never seen
Nic move that fast unless it's at a half-off sale at Prada. But
Sam's no fool. She didn't just buy into Nicole's act. Nic had to
fight to get her attention. Beg forgiveness, buy her things,
apologize in public to Lily, Carmen, and Harrison for the things
she'd done. Sam put her through the wringer before date 1. I wasn't
even sure that Sam as ever even going to go out with Nicole. I
prayed that she wouldn't but?she caved. Of course, I think after 2
months of constantly being inundated by someone I'd cave too. Or
call the police to report a stalker.</p>

<p>It was so sweet. Sam actually asked MY permission to date
Nicole. </p>

<p>"She's your friend first and if it's going to make things awkward for
you, or us then I'd rather not," she'd said. And I know that if I'd
asked her not to, she would have said `no' to Nicole.</p>

<p>But damn me and my concern for Sam's happiness instead of my
own.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Sam?" I'd asked her. She'd smiled shyly
and blushed. It was heartbreakingly adorable.</p>

<p>"To try. I kinda wanna see what happens. Nicole seems so
different," she sighed. And I gave her my `permission' to try to
find her own happiness. It won me a huge hug at the time but in
hindsight I should have KNOWN Nicole was going to rip her to shreds
like the aforementioned lion and steak.</p>

<p>They started dating and at first it seemed all right.
Granted, I was unhappy but Sam seemed genuinely pleased with her
relationship. Nicole seemed almost bearable in her bitchiness and
things settled into a somewhat livable pattern. Nicole would pick
Sam up for a date; I'd sit at home and worry and wonder until Sam got
home; then Sam would tell me all the (slightly) edited details until
we fell asleep. We were spending a lot more time in each other's
rooms and lives now that she was dating Nicole. She'd be at
cheerleading practice, which I liked and sometimes, when I figured no
one was paying attention, I'd show off for her.</p>

<p>But someone was noticing and Nicole was pissed. She knew
about my sexuality and was determined to get the `better' of me where
Sam was concerned. I don't know if it was her plan all along but if
I ever find out the truth I swear to God, I will rip her face off.</p>

<p>Sam suddenly started pulling away from me slightly and I knew
Nicole was the reason why. Plus, Sam can't seem to lie very well to
me anymore so when I asked her, she confessed that Nicole was jealous
of our relationship. I tried to get across to Sam that she could
have both, her friendship with me and her relationship with Nicole
but Nicole was pulling her in the opposite direction. She didn't
know what end was up. I saw that it was getting harder and harder
for her to figure out so I pulled back a bit to give her some room.
And that was my biggest mistake. It left Sam too open and vulnerable
and Nicole moved in for the kill.</p>

<p>Ever notice how most of my `Nicole analogies' are animal
based? I bet you a year's allowance her birth family were barracudas.</p>

<p>Anyway, to my great horror, she took Sam on a weekend trip.
The longest weekend of my life and one I will always regret. I knew
what Nicole's plans were and I tried to warn Sam. Sam's always been?skittish about sex. It really means something to her to lose her
virginity to someone that means a lot to her. And I knew that Nicole
was NOT that someone. I begged her to carefully consider any
decisions that she would be making over the weekend and she promised
me she would. When she walked through that door Sunday night, I knew
Nicole had gotten what she wanted. And I knew Sam hadn't. I just
wondered what Nicole was going to do next.</p>
