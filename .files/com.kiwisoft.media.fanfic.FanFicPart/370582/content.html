<p>Miley Stewart stood outside the mess hall shading her eyes from the early morning sun, watching the dock. Ms. Warden stepped into the launch and settled herself down. The line was cast off, the engine roared into life, and the silver boat pulled away.</p>
<p>A diabolical look, one she would never wear in public, spread itself over Miley's normally expressionless features. She hefted the camp megaphone in her right hand, assumed her poker face, and entered the noisy mess hall.</p>
<p>"Your attention, please," she spoke into the megaphone. "This is your camp director speaking. I would just like to remind everybody that this is Camp Algonkian Island. There will be no activities today. Repeat, no activities."</p>
<p>A laughing cheer rose up from the girls. Trina groaned and glared at Kitty, who winced visibly.</p>
<p>"And now," Miley continued pleasantly, "I would like to appoint Lilly Truscott head counselor."</p>
<p>"You've already got a head counselor!" growled Marina.</p>
<p>"Yes, but she's been demoted," Miley explained. "Now, if I may continue—all punishment is hereby revoked. One of the counselors will take out the garbage. Let's pick a number at random—uh, say, thirteen."</p>
<p>"Stewart, you stop that!" shouted Trina, springing to her feet.</p>
<p>Miley stiffened. "Never, since the days of our beloved founder, Elias Warden, has a counselor disobeyed the camp director. Shape up, or you don't eat."</p>
<p>Trina, Marina and Kitty glared at Miley. Everybody else laughed, some of the counselors so hard that their heads were practically in their breakfasts.</p>
<p>"Quiet, please, I'm not finished." Miley announced. "The 'no activities' rule, of course, applies to campers only. I have noted that the counselors are in terrible physical condition. Accordingly, the counselors' relay races will begin shortly after breakfast. This will be followed by the counselors' obstacle course, the counselors' shotput, the counselors' swimming race, the counselors' discus throw, the counselors' ten-kilometer run, the counselors' soccer game, field hockey game, baseball game, high jump and, if there is time, the counselors' lunch."</p>
<p>By now the girls were howling in hysterics, but the counselors were no longer amused.</p>
<p>"Stewart, shut up!"</p>
<p>"This has gone far enough!"</p>
<p>"I'm not running ten kilometers on Stewart's say-so!"</p>
<p>"She has no real authority!"</p>
<p>"All right!" announced Marina, rising to her feet. "That's enough. The game's over, Stewart. You're not camp director any more."</p>
<p>"This is mutiny," warned Miley calmly.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Stewart!" said Trina furiously. "Get over here and give me that megaphone!"</p>
<p>"And about time too!" sneered Ashley.</p>
<p>Sarah leapt to her feet. "Now, just a minute!" she protested. "You guys made a deal, and Stewart won fair and square! Just because you don't like it, you can't weasel out!"</p>
<p>"It's not fair!" added someone from Cabin 15.</p>
<p>"She has a point there," said Chantel grudgingly.</p>
<p>"Whose side are you on?" snapped Trina.</p>
<p>"Well you <i>did</i> make a deal," said Chantel lamely.</p>
<p>"If you're quite finished," said Miley, "we can do this the democratic way. Who in this room believes in the concept of freedom and justice and wants me to serve my rightful term as camp director?"</p>
<p>"<i>We do!</i>" Most of the campers' hands went up, accompanied by wild yelling, cheering and stamping.</p>
<p>"Practically unanimous," said Miley. "Now, as I was saying, all campers must rest and relax today. If you need something, send your counselor for it. They are, after all, here at your service. There will be numerous announcements made as the day progresses. That will be all for now."</p>
<p>She got a tremendous cheer.</p>
<p>"When I blow this whistle," said Miley into the megaphone, "the first counselor on each team tucks the grapefruit under her chin, puts the sack on her feet and jumps over to that line of trees and back. Then she passes the grapefruit over to the next person—without using her hands. If she drops it, the whole team has to do ten push-ups each before continuing. The first team finished gets ribbons, which they may wear all day. Head counselor Truscott will be the judge."</p>
<p>Miley blew the whistle and then blew it again. "Stop, stop. False start."</p>
<p>Trina was already lying on the ground, her feet tangled in the sack, a crushed grapefruit under her body.</p>
<p>"Team four, ten push-ups," Miley ordered. "Marina, go and get another grapefruit, please."</p>
<p>"This day won't last forever!" said Marina warningly. She trotted off towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>"A treat today," announced Miley. "Instead of having you run the old obstacle course, I've made up a new one for you."</p>
<p>Kitty wrung the grapefruit juice out of the front of her shirt.</p>
<p>The counselors were a bedraggled sight. Trina, more dead than alive, had actually run into a tree. Marina's team had accumulated fifty push-ups. Ruby had fallen so many times that she was dirt from head to toe. The only counselors who wore smiles were Chantel and her team. They had won the relay race and now sported bright blue first-place ribbons.</p>
<p>"Here's what you do," instructed Miley. "Everybody get a partner. First you run to where the jump ropes are and skip ten times. Then over to the sand pit, which you slither through snake-fashion. Then you somersault over to that tree, and hop on one foot over to the vaulting horse, which you get over any way you can. Then you leap over the wading pool and run to the baseball diamond, where you crab-walk around the bases. Then you climb through the tunnel and run over to where head counselor Truscott is waiting to check in your time. Have you got all that?"</p>
<p>A loud babble of protest exploded from the counselors.</p>
<p>"What are the partners for?" asked Ruby suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said Miley. "Didn't I mention it? This is all to be done three-legged with your partner."</p>
<p>"What?" cried Marina. "You mean tied together? Like a three-legged race?"</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Miley.</p>
<p>Trina nudged Marina. "Why do we have to let him push us around like this?"</p>
<p>"Because if we don't," said Marina, "we come off looking bad to the rest of the kids. Besides, when you come right down to it, Kitty almost dragged Stewart into this deal. If you want to kill somebody, try Kitty!"</p>
<p>"Come on, you guys," said Miley. "There's ribbons in it for the three best times. And the worst three get ten push-ups. Line up. First two pairs."</p>
<p>Trina and Marina lined up beside Chantel and her partner. Miley blew the whistle. Chantel and her partner took off in a shambling gait toward the jump ropes. Trina and Marina took two steps and fell over.</p>
<p>"Stop it, you klutz!" howled Marina. "That's my leg you're ripping out!" The two began to writhe and struggle.</p>
<p>"Get up, Trina! Get up!" cheered the girls of Cabin 13.</p>
<p>Slowly and painstakingly, Trina and Marina managed to get themselves upright. They began to shuffle off after the first pair, gradually getting the hang of running tied together. Soon they were hopelessly entangled in the skipping ropes. Meanwhile, Chantel and her partner were already somersaulting after their crawl through the sand.</p>
<p>"It's amazing," reflected Miley philosophically. "Some people are natural-born athletes." In the distance, Trina and Marina fell over again. "And some people aren't."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Miley, "your attention, please. Because of this morning's strenuous activities, I have decided to cancel the ten-kilometer run."</p>
<p>"And a good thing too!" growled Marina, flipping her wet hair back off her forehead. She and Trina had failed to clear the wading pool.</p>
<p>"Instead," Miley went on, "I would like everyone to gather in the woods by the creek."</p>
<p>"What for?" muttered Trina, trying to wring the water out of her shorts.</p>
<p>"The tug of war," explained Miley as she led the march towards the woods. "All partners from the last event break up and go to opposite sides of the creek. Head counselor Truscott will, of course, be judge."</p>
<p>As the two teams lined up, with the rope strung across the creek, the counselors surveyed the scene distastefully. Stewart had chosen the spot well. The winners were going to get ribbons, and the losers were going to get wet.</p>
<p>"When I blow the whistle," announced Miley, "you all start pulling. Are the instructions perfectly clear?"</p>
<p>"Get on with it," muttered Marina absently. She was staring across the creek at her opponents with a look of determination on her face.</p>
<p>Miley blew her whistle and Marina's team effortlessly pulled Trina's team right off the bank and into the creek. The cheering from the campers and the winning counselors was deafening.</p>
<p>Miley blew her whistle for order. "Head counselor Truscott, your decision."</p>
<p>"I think those guys won," stammered Lilly, pointing at Marina and her team.</p>
<p>From her pocket Miley produced a handful of blue ribbons and began to distribute them among the winners.</p>
<p>Trina waded out of the creek and glared at Marina, who was proudly displaying her ribbon and laughing at the spectacle of half her staff floundering about in the creek. Enraged, Trina reached out, closed her hand on Marina's ankle and heaved. Feet first, Marina hit the water.</p>
<p>"What did you do that for?" she spluttered.</p>
<p>In answer Trina placed her hand on the top of Marina's head and pushed her under water. As if on cue, all the winners jumped in and went after the losers. Trina and Marina were splashing violently at each other. In a matter of seconds the creek was a boiling torrent of rollicking, laughing bodies. On the shore, the campers cheered themselves hoarse.</p>
<p>Miley blew the whistle and the brawl ceased. One by one the counselors crawled out of the water and stood dripping and gasping on the bank.</p>
<p>"This is Camp Algonkian Island," began Miley sternly. "Whatever that outburst was, I'm sure that it hasn't happened since the days of Elias. I expect better than this from my staff. Watch it, or you don't eat. And speaking of eating, it's time for lunch. Everyone go clean up."</p>
<p>As they walked back towards the compound, Lilly caught up to Miley. "You know," she said nervously, "tomorrow the clones are going to nail you to the wall and me to you!"</p>
<p>"In that case," replied Miley, "we'll just have to leave, won't we?"</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes widened. "I heard you promise Marina that nobody goes home!"</p>
<p>"Right," said Miley. "That was for today. I never said anything about tomorrow."</p>
<p>Lilly's heart sank.</p>
<p>"Your attention, please," announced Miley over the megaphone. Everyone was just coming to the end of lunch. "This is your camp director speaking. This afternoon all campers and counselors will take part in the first annual Elias Warden Memorial Scavenger Hunt. Head counselor Truscott is now handing out the lists of what you are to retrieve. When you are finished, gather outside my office to have your things checked out. There are ribbons in it for the best collectors. The judge, as always, will be head counselor Truscott."</p>
<p>"And what will you be doing, oh imperious leader?" asked Marina sarcastically, taking a scavenger sheet from Lilly.</p>
<p>Miley sighed. "Head counselor Truscott and myself have heaps of paperwork to be taken care of," she said wearily. "We'll be in my office."</p>
<p>"I'm going to be there, Stewart," said Marina through clenched teeth. "When Ms. Warden's away, that office is my responsibility."</p>
<p>"When the camp director is away," corrected Miley. "However, the camp director is here—me. And when I'm away, my duties are taken over by the head counselor—her." She pointed to Lilly.</p>
<p>"I know what she's up to," piped up Ashley. "She just wants to get to the office phone to call her parents to come and get her!"</p>
<p>"Shut up, you twit!" snapped Lilly.</p>
<p>"Ashley, you're on work detail tonight," said Miley briskly.</p>
<p>"I don't have to listen to you!" sneered Ashley.</p>
<p>"Yes you do!" shouted Sarah. "Stewart is camp director today and she's the boss! Isn't that right, Trina?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," mumbled Trina unhappily.</p>
<p>"All right, everyone," Miley announced. "Into the woods. Pair up if you like. Happy hunting."</p>
<p>She and Lilly walked towards the camp director's cottage. Marina followed.</p>
<p>"Soon today will be over," breathed Trina to Chantel, her partner. "Stewart's game will finish, and mine will start. I'll have her hide for this!"</p>
<p>Chantel laughed. "I don't know, Trina. I think Stewart's just what this place needs. Listen to what's going on." All around them the woods rang with shouts and laughter from campers and counselors alike. "I've never seen camp spirit like this. And the kid is so funny! I knew it the minute she pulled that <i>salete</i> bit!" She chuckled at the mere memory.</p>
<p>"I didn't find it funny," grumbled Trina.</p>
<p>"That's because the joke was on you," said Chantel. "Now, come on. Get into the spirit of the thing. What's the first item on the list?"</p>
<p>Trina looked, then stared. "<i>A brontosaurus rib</i>," she read. "You see? Stewart's crazy! I told you!"</p>
<p>"What a sense of humor!" marveled Chantel. "All right, let's fight fire with fire. We'll substitute a chicken bone from the dump." She slapped the bewildered Trina on the shoulder. "Let's see what our friend Stewart has to say to that."</p>
<p>Trina grinned grudgingly.</p>
<p>"Get away from that phone!" snapped Marina suddenly. "You're not to touch it!"</p>
<p>"What if it rings?" asked Miley.</p>
<p>"Then answer it," said Marina. "But I want you to promise that you won't make any calls yourselves."</p>
<p>"I promise," chorused Miley and Lilly.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Miley, looking around the office, "time to examine the records." She pulled open a filing cabinet.</p>
<p>"Get out of there, Stewart!" snapped Marina. "Those are confidential records on all the campers."</p>
<p>"Well, we can certainly see our own," said Miley, flipping through the folders. "Here it is—<i>Stewart, Miley</i>." She began to read silently. "It says here that I'm a homesick troublemaker who won't take part in anything. Not very flattering, but at least Trina got the last part right."</p>
<p>Lilly found her own folder and pulled out the evaluation sheet. "Hey, mine's blank!"</p>
<p>Miley produced a pen. "Well, we'll soon remedy that." Before Marina could stop her, she had scrawled <i>Chooses friends well</i> on Lilly's report and initialed it <i>M.S.</i></p>
<p>"Stewart, you put those files back and close that drawer," shouted Marina. "Come sit down at the desk and stay out of trouble!"</p>
<p>"I wonder if this is a eucalyptus tree," said Amber to her partner, Sarah. "We're supposed to bring back eucalyptus bark."</p>
<p>"It's just plain elm," replied Sarah.</p>
<p>"We'll take it anyway," decided Amber, stripping some bark from the trunk. "Stewart won't know the difference."</p>
<p>Sarah laughed. "The counselors underestimated Stewart too, and now she's the camp director."</p>
<p>"I wish she was camp director all the time," said Amber. "I've never laughed so much in my life! When Trina and Marina took off on Stewart's obstacle course I thought I'd die!"</p>
<p>"This," said Chantel to Trina, "is the closest thing to a moon rock you're going to find on Earth."</p>
<p>"Good," said Trina. "We'll use it. I can't wait to see the look on Stewart's face when we give her a taste of her own medicine with this stuff."</p>
<p>"What's next on the list?" asked Chantel.</p>
<p>Trina made a face. "<i>Pure mineral water.</i> Now, where are we going to find pure mineral water?"</p>
<p>"Follow me," said Chantel, starting to walk purposefully towards the creek. She dipped a jar into the creek and brought it up again.</p>
<p>"Behold—water." She picked up a rock from the bank.</p>
<p>"Behold—mineral." She dropped the rock into the jar. "Presto—mineral water."</p>
<p>"It's not pure," protested Trina.</p>
<p>"Quit spoiling it or I'll get another partner," said Chantel. "This scavenger hunt is supposed to be for fun."</p>
<p>"Stewart doesn't believe in fun," growled Trina. "Ask her."</p>
<p>"You know what your trouble is?" said Chantel. "You're like Ms. Warden. You don't like kids."</p>
<p>"I like kids," argued Trina. "But Stewart isn't a kid."</p>
<p>"Forget it," said Chantel. "What's next?"</p>
<p>Trina winced. "<i>Nuclear waste.</i>"</p>
<p>The telephone in Ms. Warden's office rang. Miley leaned back in the swivel chair, put her feet up on the desk and reached for the receiver, beating Marina to it by half a second.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon. Camp Algonkian Island. M. Stewart, Director, speaking. How may I help you?...Ah, yes, the order for volleyballs. I remember it well…Ten? Oh no, I must have left off a couple of zeros…Yes, make that a thousand. We play a lot of volleyball up here. Why, just last week—"</p>
<p>"Stewart, give me that!" Marina grabbed the receiver from Miley's hand. "Hello, this is Marina. Hello?...Hello?" Her face fell. "She hung up. Stewart, if a thousand volleyballs arrive here, you're dead!"</p>
<p>"This is Camp Algonkian Island, soon to be famous for its volleyball program," deadpanned Miley. "Never before, since the days of Elias, has anyone threatened the life of the camp director."</p>
<p>Lips twitching, Marina stared at her, and then burst into laughter. "Don't let Ms. Warden hear your Elias jokes, Stewart. And no more talking on the telephone." She glared at Lilly. "Stop that snickering, Truscott. You may be head counselor, but tomorrow I'll have my job back!"</p>
<p>"No wonder Ms. Warden's always so cranky," said Miley. "You never let her have any fun."</p>
<p>"Did you guys find anything?" asked Lucy as she and her two partners came upon Sarah and Amber in the woods.</p>
<p>"Nah," said Amber. "We're not doing very well. We missed the nuclear waste and the brontosaurus rib, and we faked the eucalyptus bark and the trilobite fossil."</p>
<p>"We got the pterodactyl nest," announced Lucy proudly.</p>
<p>"So what?" said Sarah. "We got the man-eating plant." She reached into her bag and pulled out a wilted dandelion.</p>
<p>"That's as authentic as our pterodactyl nest," agreed Lucy, and they continued on their separate ways.</p>
<p>"What are you getting in the kitchen?" called Trina to Chantel, who had gone into the mess hall.</p>
<p>Chantel came out carrying two ice cubes in a paper cup. "The iceberg," she grinned. "That's everything now. Let's go get our ribbons."</p>
<p>With Trina carrying the carton containing their finds, they walked across the compound towards the director's cottage. A large crowd was already gathered, laughing and talking amid bags and boxes of scavenger hunt treasure.</p>
<p>Miley, Lilly and Marina appeared on the veranda. The campers began to cheer wildly.</p>
<p>"What are they yelling about?" asked Trina peevishly.</p>
<p>"They're cheering Stewart," explained Chantel patiently. "They've had a real good day."</p>
<p>Miley spoke into the megaphone. "It is now time for the judging of the first annual Elias Warden Memorial Scavenger Hunt. Raise your hand if you got the iceberg."</p>
<p>Chantel kicked Trina in the back of the leg, causing her to emit a startled yell.</p>
<p>"Trina—what a surprise," said Miley. "Come on up. Let's see your iceberg."</p>
<p>Defiantly Trina stepped up onto the veranda and held out the cup containing the rapidly dwindling ice cubes. "It melted a little while we were getting it here."</p>
<p>"Understandable," said Miley. "A very fine specimen indeed." She presented a shocked Trina with a blue ribbon and shook her hand solemnly. "Congratulations."</p>
<p>Amid applause, and beaming with amusement and pleasure, Trina walked back to Chantel.</p>
<p>"Now," said Miley, "who got the eucalyptus bark?"</p>
<p>"We did!" piped Amber, running to the veranda and dragging Sarah with her. "Here." She held out the bark.</p>
<p>"This is a fraud," said Miley disapprovingly. She sniffed at the bark. "It's obviously elm."</p>
<p>"See?" laughed Sarah. "She knows everything!"</p>
<p>Miley handed a white third-place ribbon to Sarah. "For a lesson well learned," she said.</p>
<p>Chantel earned a second-place red ribbon for her brontosaurus rib, as did Kitty for her plastic bagful of mud labeled <i>Nuclear Waste</i>. Amber redeemed herself by winning a first for the man-eating dandelion, and the pterodactyl nest earned a third for Lucy. Ruby got a first prize and the loudest cheer of the day when she submitted Amy, counselor of Cabin 15, as a genuine Neanderthal woman. Trina and Chantel picked up a third for the mineral water. Five girls from Cabin 19 were awarded blue ribbons for their stalactite, which had taken them all afternoon to carve. Assorted prehistoric fossils, rare stones and natural phenomena were all justly rewarded.</p>
<p>By the time the awards broke up, it was supper time.</p>
<p>"Your attention, please. This is your camp director speaking." There was an enormous cheer from all the campers, as well as stamping of feet and banging on plates. "Tonight," Miley went on after the rumpus had died down, "the counselors' tag championships will take place. We'll have to pick a number to be 'it' first—uh, say, thirteen."</p>
<p>At table 13, Trina shook her head resignedly, but she was smiling.</p>
<p>"Head counselor Truscott will, of course, be referee," Miley continued.</p>
<p>"After that, the counselors will entertain by singing the 'Anvil Chorus' from <i>Il Trovatore</i> by Giuseppe Verdi."</p>
<p>There was a hoot of laughter from the counselors.</p>
<p>"By then, Ms. Warden will be back to relieve me of my duties."</p>
<p>There were loud hisses, boos and groans at this announcement.</p>
<p>"At that time also," Miley added, "Marina will resume her duties as head counselor."</p>
<p>There were more boos, to which Marina stood up and took an elaborate bow.</p>
<p>"On a completely serious note," said Miley, her face growing solemn, "I feel that Elias would have been proud of all of us today." She handed the megaphone to Lilly for comment.</p>
<p>"Uh—yeah," stammered Lilly. "Me too."</p>
<p>There was tremendous laughter and applause.</p>
<p>"<i>Tag!</i>" bellowed Trina, slapping Chantel on the back. "You're 'it'!"</p>
<p>Chantel took off after Kitty, who dodged frantically and ran screaming towards the dock.</p>
<p>The counselors had already been at it for forty-five minutes, and all the campers were frolicking around with them. Everyone, except Miley and Lilly, was completely covered in dirt. The administrators, in their last hours of office, were seated on a bench at the center of the compound, watching the game.</p>
<p>"Look at those clones," marveled Lilly. "It's hard to believe. What's going to happen if the Warden walks in on this?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged indifferently. "What are you worried about? You're not the head counselor. Marina is."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed. "You really put it to them today. But tomorrow…"</p>
<p>"And that prospect constitutes grounds for departure," said Miley.</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head. She would never, ever understand Miley, no matter how much she wanted to. A comfortable silence fell between them, and Lilly was gazing at the rowdy game of tag going on before them when suddenly Miley scooted closer to her, for no apparent reason. Their sides were flush up against each other. Lilly glanced over and was surprised to see Miley looking at her lips. Lilly's gaze flickered to Miley's lips as well before she turned her head away, blushing.</p>
<p>Miley continued to watch Lilly. "What are you afraid of?" she asked quietly.</p>
<p>Lilly's heart thudded in her chest. "Uh…" her throat was dry. "N-nothing?"</p>
<p>"Oh, good," said Miley, and then lifted her hand to the far side of Lilly's face, gently turning her head before sliding her fingers down to her chin. Her face came closer to Lilly's, her mouth dangerously close to Lilly's own. Lilly could feel Miley's soft breath against her lips. Her eyes locked on with Miley's, although they were too close to focus well.</p>
<p>"Can I?" Miley asked huskily. Lilly stared mutely at Miley for a beat, and then nodded her head ever so slightly.</p>
<p>Miley bridged the gap between them, kissing Lilly lightly on the mouth, and then slowly on the cheek before pulling back. She allowed a smile to grace her lips momentarily, which Lilly returned, although hers was a bit shaky. The sound of the game nearing their proximity split them up quickly, Miley's face returning to its stony indifference, Lilly's a flaming red. Luckily it was too dark to notice.</p>
<p>Their attention returned to the tag championship.</p>
<p>"Ha!" shouted Marina. "You're 'it'!"</p>
<p>"I am not!" screamed Ruby. "You didn't touch me!"</p>
<p>"I did so!"</p>
<p>"You did not!"</p>
<p>"Truscott," called Trina, "you're the referee! What's the decision?"</p>
<p>"No tag," gulped Lilly, glad for the distraction.</p>
<p>"<i>No tag?</i>" cried Marina. "What do you mean no tag?" She stuck out her foot and tripped Ruby, who fell over, pulling Trina down with her.</p>
<p>"You did that on purpose!" stormed Ruby.</p>
<p>"Darn right!" grinned Marina.</p>
<p>Trina laughed diabolically and knocked Marina down. In a matter of seconds all the counselors had waded joyfully into the fray. The campers crowded around in a great circle, cheering.</p>
<p>There were two long whistle blasts, the signal used to summon the counselors. Everyone jumped up and looked at Miley, who pointed behind them. Slowly, agonizingly slowly, everyone turned. There, staring at them in open-mouthed disbelief was Ms. Warden.</p>
<p>Helpfully, Miley rushed over and handed the megaphone to the camp director.</p>
<p>"This is Camp Algonkian Island," Ms. Warden began slowly. She ignored the roar of laughter and continued, "It was founded thirty-one years ago by my grandfather, Elias Warden. Never before has the entire staff gone completely insane!"</p>
<p>"Shape up or you don't eat," whispered Miley to Lilly.</p>
<p>As always, Lilly started the laughter. It spread like a virus through the ranks of the campers and grew until everyone, including the counselors, was slapping knees, holding sides and laughing uproariously. Only Miley and the camp director were in control of themselves.</p>
<p>Oh well, thought Ms. Warden, after all this is Camp Algonkian Island, where everyone is supposed to have a wonderful time. No harm done—I guess.</p>
<p>The beaver lay sleepless and trembling. Everything had been going along so well until today. But today humans had been everywhere, hundreds of them. Twice he had been swamped trying to protect the dam. Fortunately they had done little damage, but if they were constantly interrupting him, he would <i>never</i> finish his dam!</p>
