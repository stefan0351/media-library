<!-- Starlight \ Part 16 -->

<p>Buffy turned her head and observed the people gathered in the room around her. Xander and Anya were lounging on Giles's couch both looking beyond bored, Spike was sitting in the left corner of the room sipping from a mug moodily, and Giles was standing just off to her side glaring at Spike. They were waiting for Willow to get back from school. The hacker hadn't wanted to leave Buffy's side but the Slayer had insisted. University wasn't like High School were attendance was really a courtesy to the tax payers. You could get kicked out for poor attendance and Buffy wasn't about to let that happen to Willow. As for herself, if the note they had written after hacking into the Sunnydale General mainframe worked, she would be excused for medical reasons. She didn't really want to think about the 'if not' or her mothers reaction to it.</p>

<p>&#34;I've mutilated corpses that were more fun than you blokes,&#34; Spike comment having finished his snack.</p>

<p>&#34;We could always play 'Shove the Stake in the Vampire',&#34; Buffy responded looking at him with a sweet smile. &#34;If you'd prefer.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The vampire's right,&#34; Anya said perking up. &#34;We could be having the sex now,&#34; she continued running her hand up Xander's-who had the decency to blush-chest.</p>

<p>&#34;Ix nay on the ex say,&#34; Xander responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Not that I wish to join the ranks of those who came before me,&#34; Giles started. &#34;But, is there a reason you've gathered us all. Other than to enjoy each others company that is?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;And as soon as Willow gets here everything will be made clear.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ohhh, somebody's been taking notes from the Cryptics Handbook,&#34; Spike said in response. &#34;At the hour of the wolf in the light of the crescent moon the truth of truths will be revealed and placed upon our feet for reflection and knowledge,&#34; he went on sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#34;You're a sad little man aren't you?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>Spike was about to respond when Giles's front door opened and Willow breezed into the room. The books that had been in her hands were quickly discarded and she made a bee-line for Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Got your message,&#34; she said looking down at the Slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled.</p>

<p>&#34;Alright, I think it's about time to get this show on the road,&#34; the Slayer responded.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>&#34;I didn't have time to go through a trial run, so you'll have to excuse any minor technical difficulties,&#34; Buffy said addressing the group as she moved the chair backwards until all the occupants of the room were in front of her. Once she was positioned she hesitated for a moment praying that what she was about to do wouldn't end in an anti-climax, then she placed her hands on the arms of the chair bracing herself for what was about to come.</p>

<p>Everyone in front of Buffy watched with a baited breath as she slowly raised one foot, then the other and planted them on the floor. Everyone in the room waited with a breathless anticipation as Buffy used her braced arms to push up lifting herself out of the chair. And everyone in the rooms breath hitched as the now vertically inclined Slayer swayed slightly while looking down at her legs like a mother would a disobedient child.</p>

<p>Buffy stood looking down at her legs, her position precarious to say the least. She knew that there was only one of two outcomes to the situation and in the first few seconds she was upright she began to worry that it would be the &#34;fall flat on her ass&#34; outcome. However, as she felt herself began to steady she grinned mentally, sometimes being a Slayer didn't suck.</p>

<p>Looking up, the Scoobs became witnesses to an ecstatic, giddy, relieved, and mischievous smile. Buffy looked to all to be the cat who had swallowed the canary. And she was.</p>

<p>&#34;As my first official act of re-bipedal Dom,&#34; Buffy said focusing her attention on Spike. &#34;I decree,&#34; but instead of finishing her sentence she crossed the room as fast as her legs would carry her and slapped the vampire upside the head. &#34;That's for the Barbie crack,&#34; she explained backing away from Spike who by then was shaking with repressed rage.</p>

<p>Buffy then turned around to face the rest of the group, barely having enough time to spread her arms before Willow was in between them hugging her.</p>

<p>&#34;Group hug!&#34; Xander exclaimed wrapping himself around the girls only to be joined seconds later by Giles.</p>

<p>&#34;This is a bizarre ritual,&#34; Anya commented watching them all. &#34;Those are the best kind,&#34; she continued before jumping in as well.</p>

<p>&#34;Can't breathe,&#34; Buffy managed to choke out. She appreciated the effort, really she did, she just appreciated oxygen more.</p>

<p>&#34;Right.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Is that a problem?&#34;</p>

<p>Were the various responses as they all disentangled themselves from around her.</p>

<p>&#34;You guys got any plans for the rest of the day?&#34; Buffy asked grinning.</p>

<p>&#34;Actually there's a very interesting program on the mating habits of Atlantic salmon coming on the Discovery channel at…&#34; Giles trailed off when he received the looks the gang was shooting him. &#34;No plans at all,&#34; he said revising his answer.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled and looked at Willow. Willow smiled and looked at Xander. Xander smiled and looked at Anya. Anya was fussing with her cuticles and didn't smile at anyone. Xander shrugged and smiled at Giles.</p>

<p>&#34;That's good,&#34; Buffy said once the game of visual 'telephone' was over. &#34;Cause I got some.&#34;</p>
