Now, back to our feature presentation….</p>

<p>
Mike turned around and closed the screen door leading into the house,
his movements very slow and very precise.  He stayed facing the door
for a moment, taking a deep breath then turned around to face his
fiancé who was standing just across from him with her hands folded
across her chest her eyes peering behind him and out the glass of the
door. Crossing the few steps between them Mike placed his hand on the
small of her back leading her into the study, away from prying eyes.</p>

<p>"She said…" Mike began trailing off.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jane agreed nodding her head, although she wasn't quite
certain why.</p>

<p>"Brooke's not…" he replied once again leaving the sentence hanging.</p>

<p>"I didn't think Sam was, but…," Jane responded contemplatively.</p>

<p>"Not that there's anything wrong with that," they both injected a
moment later, before nodding at each other in acknowledgement of the
others statement.  </p>

<p>"A golfing buddy of mine is, you know," Mike said finally.</p>

<p>"I have a sorority sister who is too," Jane added.  She wasn't quite
sure if it was a relevant piece of information, and if it was why it
was, but it seemed like a good thing to add at the time, so that's
what she did.</p>

<p>Mike nodded along but didn't say anything for a moment. </p>

<p>"Wouldn't we have known?" he asked finally.  He sounded more hopeful
than convinced however.</p>

<p>"Maybe, I mean…maybe," Jane responded.</p>

<p>"Nobody guessed about Liberace," Mike observed thoughtfully.  </p>

<p>"And Lily Tomlin.  That one threw me," Jane added, shifting her
weight.  "Then again I never would have guessed about Ellen," she
continued.</p>

<p>"There would have been signs," Mike stated, but really it sounded
more like a question.  He knew that with Sam, Jane had found the
pamphlet but Brooke?  Where were the signs?  The preparation?  The
heart attack prevention measures?</p>

<p>"Ellen never really talked about her personal life in her routines,"
Jane responded.  "Hers was always more situational comedy.  Like that
bit about why people put arrows at the bottom of pages, like they
would forget to check the other side or something."</p>

<p>"I meant about Brooke," Mike injected scowling at her.</p>

<p>"Oh.  Sorry," Jane responded shaking her head a little bit.  She felt
lightheaded, like on a hot day in Fresno.  </p>

<p>"Wait.  Brooke's got a copy of that movie `Bound'," Mike blurted out.
His mind automatically drifting to consider the uncanny physical
resemblance between Sam and Gina Gershon.  He wondered if that had
done it.</p>

<p>"Sam was fascinated with the book `The Edible Woman' until she found
out what it was actually about," Jane related in a similar tone.</p>

<p>"Brooke has every Madonna album ever produced," Mike said running a
hand through his hair and tugging at it gently.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Jane muttered under her breath.  She was finally able begin
comprehending what Mary Cherry had told them, what seemed like eons
ago, and she really wished she hadn't been.</p>

<p>"But…Brooke's a cheerleader!" Mike exclaimed looking over a Jane
hopefully.  Brooke couldn't be…with Sam, because Brooke wasn't gay,
he reasoned to himself.  </p>

<p>"Think about how they've been acting since we got back," Jane
continued, not even aware that he had spoken, so busy was she trying
to put the clues together.  "Oh god, think about how we found they
when we got back!  And when I went to return Brooke's book, and…I
need to sit down," she finished plopping into a nearby chair.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" Mike asked with a dazed look on his face
as he leaned against the desk wearily.</p>

<p>"We have to talk to them.  If something is going on then we need to
know what, and if nothing going on then we need to know that too,"
Jane replied thoughtfully.  "But for the moment, the name Jack
Daniel's comes to mind."  She paused.  "At least for you."</p>
