<p>Outer Earth:</p>

<p>Giles held Joyce tightly as they waited for the two slayers and their
perspective soulmates to return from the Middle Ethereal.  He wanted
to comfort Joyce, to tell her that everything was going to be OK but
he couldn't, all he really could do is tell her that when he left
them all four girls where safe, and hold on to her.  He loved all
four girls like they where his own daughters, but he knew that all of
this was taking a bigger toll on Joyce, after all she was Buffy's
mom, and their was nothing he could do to help her through this
except be there for her.</p>

<p>Joyce rested her head on Giles shoulders and wandered what was going
through his mind. She knew he had done his best to assure her that
Buffy and the others where well and safe but she could tell by the
sound of his voice that he was worried. She couldn't blame him
because she was worried too.  The Warlock had already put Xander and
Cordelia in the hospital, killed Angel, and then almost killed her
daughter, but that's not worried her.  It was the Warlock himself
that she found herself thinking about. She couldn't get him out of
her mind.  Ever since she learned that Buffy was the Slayer she was
deeply worried for her daughters' safety, but she also realized that
Buffy could take care of herself.  Which she always did, along with
Willows help and the help of the others she always managed to
survive, but this time was different, this time she had seen the evil
that her daughter had to fight first hand.</p>

<p>Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Willow sat in Buffy's lap with her head resting on the blonde
slayer's shoulder.  Across from them Tara and Faith sat on another
one of the benches in Alexandria's Garden.  She watched them as they
whispered amongst themselves for a moment then turned her attention
back to Buffy, tilting her head just right so she could place a
gentle kiss on her soulmates lips.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Willow and tenderly ran her hands through her
soulmates silky red hair, "That's nice."</p>

<p>Willow blushed slightly and snuggled up even closer to Buffy and the
blonde slayer began to place gentle kisses on her neck.</p>

<p>"Hmmm...I hate to interrupt you but there are something's I need to
cover before your sent back to face the Warlock," Fey replied as she
approached the four young women.</p>

<p>"Like what," Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Like how the only way you can defeat him is to banish him."</p>

<p>"Banish him, why can't we just slay him," Faith replied.</p>

<p>"You could, but Ciarán is a powerful warlock and it is very likely
that he would take a couple of you with him in the prolonged fight it
would take to slay him."</p>

<p>Faith looked at Tara then over at Buffy and Willow, "So how do we
banish him?"</p>

<p>Outer Earth:</p>

<p>Giles and Joyce both leapt off of the couch when Buffy, Willow, Faith
and Tara returned.  They rushed over to the young women and began to
hug them, checking to see if they were all right.</p>

<p>After several minutes of hugging the girls broke away from Giles and
Joyce, Buffy looked at her mom then at her soon to be step-dad, "You
guys might want to sit down, we need to talk."</p>

<p>Giles and Joyce walked back over to the couch and sat down
immediately grabbing each other's hand, "OK Buffy what's going on,"
Joyce replied in a very motherly voice.</p>

<p>"We have to face the Warlock and we have to do it before tonight."</p>

<p>Giles stood up and walked over towards the four of them, "Why so
soon? We should take time and prepare, especially after what happened
last night, besides all of you should rest some."</p>

<p>"We don't have the time for that."</p>

<p>"Buffy is right Giles," Willow replied, "from what Fey said all the
stars will be in there proper alignment tonight for him to open the
Hellmouth for good, if we don't strike now it will be to late."</p>

<p>"Besides," added Buffy, "not only did Fey show us were to find the
Warlock, she also gave us something to put an end to him."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"This," answered Tara, producing a glistening red gem that was
triangular in shape.</p>

<p>"Th-th-that's...a," stammered Giles.</p>

<p>"Banishing Crystal," Tara replied.</p>

<p>"I didn't think any of them still existed."</p>

<p>"On Outer Earth they don't, but we were in the Middle Ethereal." </p>

<p>Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Fey, stood alongside Alexandria and Sabryn in the Hal of Slayers. The
three of them were staring into a mirror with golden trim that was
hung on the wall.  Through it they watched as the for chosen warriors
made their way to the warehouse that Fey had revealed to them as the
lair of the Warlock.</p>

<p>"Do you think they can do it," Alexandria inquired.</p>

<p>"They have to or all is lost," Fey replied.</p>

<p>Outer Earth:</p>

<p>Ciarán was packing up the last of the supplies he needed for
tonight's ceremony when the door to the warehouse flew open.</p>

<p>"Warlock, we have some business to settle," shouted Faith as her and
Buffy stormed through the door with Willow and Tara right behind them
chanting a protection spell for the two slayers.</p>

<p>Ciarán grinned wickedly, "So you think you have business with me,
tell me this Slayer. Do you really think you can win?" He then looked
at Buffy and Willow and snarled, "Shouldn't the two of you be dead?"</p>

<p>"Sorry to disappoint you," quipped Buffy.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, I plan on changing that circumstance right
now," growled the warlock as he raised his hands into the air and
shot a bolt of energy right at Buffy.</p>

<p>The bolt soared directly towards here but immediately dissipated when
it hit the protective field that Willow and Tara had through up over
the slayers.</p>

<p>"Somebody's been practicing, try and stop this."</p>

<p>The Warlock then launched a fireball at the four of them but it to
was stopped by the field, however both Willow and Tara could feel the
field beginning to weaken under the warlocks onslaught.</p>

<p>"You guys got to do something about this, I don't think the field can
take much more," Willow shouted.</p>

<p>"Sure thing Red."</p>

<p>"Your wish is my command," replied Buffy as she gave Willow a quick
peck on the cheek for good luck before springing into action.</p>

<p>Buffy rushed the warlock from the right and Faith from the left.  He
waved his hands through the air and sent Buffy falling to the ground,
only to be blind sided by Faith.</p>

<p>As the Slayers fought the warlock Willow and Tara quickly drew a
circle outline on the ground and sat down inside of it, they then
placed the Banishing Crystal in the center of the circle and began
the chant Fey had taught them a few hours ago.</p>

<p>Ciarán spun around in rage and lifted his right hand in the air. It
began to glow with magical energy, "See if that puny protective field
can withstand this."</p>

<p>Before the warlock could cast his spell Buffy swept his legs out from
under him.  He fell flat on his back and the energy blast that was
ment for Faith shot up straight into the air and blew a large hole in
the warehouse ceiling sending rubble falling down around them.</p>

<p>"Thanks, B."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, I kinda owed you one."</p>

<p>Faith rushed up to the warlock and kicked him square in the ribs as
he tried to get up, "That's for trying to make me feel like nothing."</p>

<p>Buffy then kicked him from the other side, "And that's for trying to
kill me and Willow."</p>

<p>Ciarán vanished before either one of the slayers could get in another
punch.  He re-appeared several feet away from them, "And this is for
thinking you could beat me."</p>

<p>The warlock then shot out several bolts of lighting at the two
slayers completely dissipating the protective field and sending the
two of them flying backwards.</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith quickly jumped to their feet and took a defensive
stance.</p>

<p>The warlock stared at them for a moment then raised both his hands
towards the ceiling,.  A large ball of fire formed above his
head, "Now I end this."</p>

<p>"Buffy, Faith...NOW," Shouted Tara causing the two slayers to dive
towards the wall of the warehouse.</p>

<p>A bright beam of blue light shot from the banishing stone and struck
the warlock in the chest lifting him up off of the ground and
canceling out his spell.</p>

<p>He screamed in agony as the gems power opened up a porthole to Limbo
around him.  The two slayers picked themselves off of the floor and
watched in astonishment as the field of light grew brighter and
brighter, then simply vanished into nothingness along with the warlock</p>

<p>They walked over to Willow and Tara and helped their perspective
soulmates up off of the warehouse floor.</p>

<p>"So what now," Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know about you B, but I think I'm gonna spend some quality
time with Tara."</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me," Tara replied before wrapping her arms around
Faith's waste.</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Willow and saw that she was grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>The redhead walked over to her and placed her hands on her
shoulders, "I think we should let Giles and your mom know we are OK."</p>

<p>Buffy's voice was filled with a little disappointment, "Oh, I guess
that's true."</p>

<p>Willow playfully punched her in the arm. "Then, afterwards, I have
special plans for you."</p>

<p>"That'll work," Buffy replied.</p>

<p>Buffy then looked over at Faith and Tara, "Hey we're going to let
everyone know we're still alive. We'll see you guys tomorrow."</p>

<p>Before Faith or Tara could respond there was a bright flash of light
and the two of them vanished before Buffy and Willow's eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy protectively wrapped her arms around Willow, "What's going on
here?"</p>

<p>"Fear not child," Fey said in a reassuring voice as she materialized
to the left of them, "the battle is won and they are safe."</p>

<p>"What happened to them."</p>

<p>"They have been sent to the Middle Ethereal."</p>

<p>"Why," Buffy and Willow asked in unison.</p>

<p>"The time has come for their destiny to be revealed."</p>

<p>
Inner Earth:</p>

<p>Lord Laos flung his seeing gem across his chambers in rage; he
couldn't believe what he had just seen.  Not only had the slayers and
witches defeated the warlock but they did so before he could open the
Hellmouth thus preventing his minions access to Outer Earth.</p>

<p>The Demon Prince let out a guttural grown that echoed throw the
bowels of his lair; "This is far from over!"</p>

<p>Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Tara and Faith found themselves standing in a cottage that the
brunette slayer didn't recognize. Faith watched as Tara's eyes ran
over her and several pictures that were laid out on a coffee table
with glee.</p>

<p>The brunette slayer walked over to her soulmate and wrapped her arm
around her, "Where are we?"</p>

<p>"Home."</p>

<p>"Home?" Inquired a very puzzled Faith.</p>

<p>"That's correct Child," replied an older looking version of Tara as
she walked in through the front door of the cottage.</p>

<p>Tara spun around and stared at the woman for a moment before rushing
over to her, "Mom!"</p>
