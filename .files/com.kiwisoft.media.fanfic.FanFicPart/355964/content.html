<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 7 -->

<p>The two friends worked for hours realigning the power couplings and restoring power to the EPS grid.  It was four hours after the official end of her shift when B'Elanna's comm badge chirped to life.  </p>

		<p>&lt;Paris to Torres&gt;</p>

		<p>B'Elanna started at the sound of Tom's voice.  She had been lost in the sensation of her body pressed tightly up against Seven's in Jeffries Tube 36 where they had been repairing the damaged relay that was exacerbating the problems with the grid.  She glanced guiltily over at Seven, who had been in heaven for the past few hours in such close proximity to the chief engineer.  She felt as though she were trying to make up for the past two weeks of not seeing or touching the Klingon hybrid, and so had taken every opportunity to initiate and prolong the physical contact between them.  Her heart froze at the sound of Tom's disembodied voice intruding on her private fantasy.</p>

		<p>&lt;Torres here&gt;</p>

		<p>&lt;Did you forget our dinner plans for tonight Lanna? &gt; </p>

		<p>B'Elanna smacked her forehead in frustration.  She had forgotten her plans with Tom...indeed she had forgotten all about the existence of the helmsman as soon as she was alone with Seven.</p>

		<p>&lt;I'm sorry Tom.  I did forget; we're working on the problem with the EPS grid, and I guess I got so wrapped up in the repairs I forgot everything else. &gt;</p>

		<p>B'Elanna winced as she heard herself make exactly the kind of excuse that used to make her crazy whenever Tom made them to her.  </p>

		<p>&lt;No problem Lanna.  If you hurry we can still have dinner and hit Sandrine's before it gets too late. &gt;</p>

		<p>At hearing the flight controller's words Seven felt a wave of jealousy sweep over her.  She didn't want B'Elanna leaving to have dinner with Tom. She wanted the engineer all to herself.  She clenched her fists tightly to stop her hands from shaking with emotion.</p>

		<p>For her part, B'Elanna was annoyed.  She had finally patched things up with Seven, and was thoroughly enjoying her time with the former drone.  The last thing she wanted to do was to leave and go have dinner with Paris.  She knew that she shouldn't be feeling this way, but there was no denying that she didn't want to leave Seven's side.</p>

		<p>&lt;I'm sorry Tom, but we're right in the middle of repairs, and I really should stay until we're through.  Maybe another time? &gt;</p>

		<p>She felt guilty for putting Tom off.  The truth was the repairs were practically done, and she could easily have handed the finishing touches off to the Gamma shift for completion, but she just couldn't bring herself to do it.</p>

		<p>&lt;Right, another time. &gt;</p>

		<p>Tom's voice sounded distracted and B'Elanna knew he was probably already running through his many options as to how to spend the evening now that he was free of his obligation to her.  She gave him about another second's thought before she turned back to Seven and the EPS grid.</p>

		<p>Seven felt a surge of elation bordering on triumph, when she heard B'Elanna make an excuse to avoid spending time with Tom.  Even though B'Elanna had clearly chosen Tom and her arrangement with him over her, Seven couldn't help but feel that she was in competition with Tom for B'Elanna's affections, and this had felt like a victory for her.  She inched herself closer to B'Elanna and together they began the delicate work of reinitializing the relay.</p>

		<p>That night as she lay awake on her bed, B'Elanna berated herself for her lack of honour.  Tonight had been her first chance to prove her commitment to Tom and she had failed miserably.  She had practically lied to him and completely ignored his wishes in order to spend time with Seven.  She didn't know how she was going to get through this.  Everything was such a mess and it was all her fault.  She got out of bed with a groan and sent a message to Tom's console asking him to have breakfast with her in the morning.  It was the least she could do after canceling their dinner plans.</p>

		<p>At breakfast the next morning B'Elanna tried to look interested as Tom gave her the details of the holoprogram he had run the night before.  It involved twentieth century technology and she couldn't possibly have been less interested.  She was paying so little attention that she was startled when she felt the pilot take her hands in his and raise them to his lips to kiss them.</p>

		<p>"I really missed you last night Lanna," she heard him say.</p>

		<p>She was confused for a moment wondering what she had missed when she heard a familiar voice behind her.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant's, may I join you?"  Now Tom's uncharacteristic affection made perfect sense.  </p>

		<p>Tom had seen Seven enter the mess hall and wasted no time in laying claim to B'Elanna.  He knew that she and B'Elanna had patched up their differences and he didn't want the drone thinking that B'Elanna was available in any way shape or form.  The pained look on her face when she saw him kissing B'Elanna's hand was sign enough that he had been successful.  He felt a surge of annoyance when B'Elanna enthusiastically invited the drone to join them.  He kept hold of B'Elanna's left hand and caressed it gently, aware that Seven's eyes where glued to the sight of their entwined hands.   The rest of the meal passed in stilted conversation as neither B'Elanna nor Seven seemed to know how to handle the situation.  They were both relieved when it was time to depart for the morning staff meeting.  Seven felt another wave of jealousy sweep over her as Tom put his arm around B'Elanna's waist as they walked to the turbolift.  </p>

		<p>Tom knew that B'Elanna wasn't overly happy about his public display of affection, and frankly he was a little surprised that she hadn't pulled away from him.  It was only then that it finally dawned on him what was going on.  He had her!  B'Elanna was going to honour their agreement no matter how she might feel about it.  He felt a sense of relief that despite Seven's obvious interest, there was no way B'Elanna was going to stain her honour by reneging on their agreement. He was also relieved that he could now go back to his regular lifestyle without worrying that Seven was making inroads into his relationship with B'Elanna.  He smiled to himself, already looking forward to an evening at his private version of Sandrine's.</p>

		<p>So things slowly returned to what passed for normal.  Tom returned to his holoprograms and his flirtations, only spending time with B'Elanna when it suited him.  The only difference was that B'Elanna no longer gave him grief about spending time together; on the contrary, she now seemed to view their time together as an obligation to be fulfilled.  A small part of Tom wasn't happy that she no longer seemed to care about his flirtations and his extracurricular activities, but for now he was having too much fun reclaiming his freedom to give it much thought.</p>

		<p>For her part, B'Elanna was relieved that Tom was moving back into his old habits.  She felt free to work as late as she pleased, and free to spend as much time as liked with Seven.  The two of them became inseparable.  Seven structured her day in order to spend as much time in engineering as possible.  While the two of them still disagreed vociferously on many occasions they still preferred to work together whenever they could.  </p>

		<p>Seven knew that she was deluding herself into thinking that B'Elanna was going to change her mind about being with Tom.  Whenever the helmsman demanded that B'Elanna spend the evening with him the engineer agreed.  Many nights when Seven checked on the location of the helmsman she felt the bile rise in her throat when the computer informed her that Tom had spent the night in B'Elanna's quarters.  On nights like that she vowed that she was going to stop seeing B'Elanna, it was simply too painful.  Yet, despite all of her private vows she always sought the engineer out as soon as possible the next day.  She was incapable of staying away no matter how bruised her heart became in the process.  </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>B'Elanna and Seven were in the engineer's quarters late one night going over plans to enhance the backup generators for the shield grid.  They had had dinner together, and afterwards had retired to the living to continue their work.  Seven was sitting on the sofa, and B'Elanna was leaning back on the easy chair as they argued over the best way to stabilize the matrix using the less powerful backup generators.  There was a pile of PADDS on the coffee table between them.</p>

		<p>"No Seven...that won't work.  Remember we already tried realigning the shield emitters to that frequency but it blew out the secondary controllers because of the 2 second power surge when we switch to the backups...Here, let me show you.  I know it's here somewhere."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna began pawing through the pile of PADDS on the coffee table in order to find the one containing the equations in question.  In the process she knocked the entire mess onto the floor.</p>

		<p>"Dammit, hang on a second Seven," she mumbled as she got down on her hands and knees to sort out the mess.</p>

		<p>Seven, seeing the disorder, knelt beside the engineer and began to help her pick up and sort through the tangle of PADDS.  Both she and B'Elanna reached for the same PADD simultaneously and their fingers brushed together, leaving them both speechless, and unable to move.  Seven felt the engineer take her hand gently.  She watched, heart pounding, as B'Elanna's darker fingers caressed the back of her hand gently.  Slowly, inexorably, Seven looked up and into B'Elanna's eyes.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna felt a jolt as her fingers brushed over Seven's when they were straightening out the pile of PADDS.  She couldn't remember ever experiencing anything like it before in her life.  She felt as if she had just thrust her hand into the warp core.  She couldn't stop herself from taking Seven's slim, pale hand into her own, nor could she stop herself from stroking her fingers over the perfect porcelain skin of the beautiful young woman.  She was completely lost in the moment and in the sensation.  When she looked up she saw Seven watching their entwined hands with absolute fascination.  When the former drone slowly raised her head and their eyes met B'Elanna thought she might lose herself forever in the depths of Seven's beautiful blue eyes.  All thoughts of Tom, and of honour, of agreements, of everything but this moment and this feeling were gone from her head.  She pulled gently on Seven's hand at the same time as she leaned slowly forward basking in the eternity that was the prelude to their kiss.  When their lips finally touched, for a moment neither of them moved.  Keeping hold of Seven's hand, B'Elanna moved her other hand up to touch the alabaster cheek of the Astrometrics officer.  She pulled her gently closer and deepened the contact between them.  She felt the former drone pulling her closer and crushing their bodies together, but it wasn't until she heard Seven's moan of pleasure that B'Elanna finally realized what she was doing and threw herself backwards and out of Seven's embrace.</p>

		<p>"Seven, oh God...I'm so sorry.  I shouldn't have done that.  I'm so sorry..." B'Elanna was horrified by her actions, and could think of nothing to say to mitigate the damage she was certain she'd done to their friendship.</p>

		<p>It took Seven several seconds to realize what was happening.  She had never experienced such exquisite pleasure before in her life, and she had never felt such pain as she did at hearing B'Elanna denounce her actions.  She moved forward and tried to pull B'Elanna back into her embrace.</p>

		<p>"Do not apologize B'Elanna, I have longed for your touch for so long now.  Please..." Seven's voice was anguished and B'Elanna felt as though she were dying inside as pushed Seven's hands away.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry...I can't do this.  I'm with Tom...I...I just can't..."</p>

		<p>Seven's pain was replaced with a flash flood of anger.</p>

		<p>"I cannot believe you are going to stay with him despite your feelings for me."</p>

		<p>"You know I have to Seven...I can't sacrifice my honour...not for anything."</p>

		<p>"Do you think I am a complete fool B'Elanna Torres?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was at a loss for words, and could only sit in stunned silence.  She didn't think she'd ever seen Seven so angry.</p>

		<p>"You hide like a frightened child behind your 'arrangement' with Tom Paris and you call it honour."</p>

		<p>"It is honour Seven; I gave my word..."</p>

		<p>"Shut up!!"  Seven cried out frantically.  "There is no honour in a loveless relationship and even you know that B'Elanna Torres.  You stay with Paris because you are afraid of really loving someone.  You are no Klingon; so don't insult me with your lies about your precious honour.  If you were truly honourable you would have never gotten involved in such an arrangement, and you wouldn't be turning your back on love now with me.  You are afraid of being hurt and so you hide from love. You are nothing but a coward and a liar.  You disgust me!"  Seven spat out her final words like a curse as she scrambled to her feet and blindly fled B'Elanna's quarters, tears once again streaming down her face. </p>

		<p>B'Elanna couldn't move.  She sat on the floor crying an ocean of tears as her world crumbled around her.  She had lost her only friend, her only chance at love, and all she had left was her ill-conceived arrangement with Tom Paris.  She was without love, without honour, and without hope.  Slowly she lay down amidst the welter of PADDS, curling up like a child and howling her grief to the uncaring walls.</p>
