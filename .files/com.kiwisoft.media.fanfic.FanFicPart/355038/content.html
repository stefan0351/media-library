<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 7 -->

<p>"B...B! wake up!!"</p>
<p>"Huh? Faith? What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Well, word has it somethings wrong with you. I wanted to check on you myself, I'm worried too."</p>
<p>"Word has it? How could you have heard and word how does word reach the land of the living vegetables! Besides, I'm fine."</p>
<p>"Hey c'mon B there is no reason to get nasty! And you're not fine. Buffy...I care about you! I want to help you!"</p>
<p>"Why? I killed you."</p>
<p>"I'm not dead. Remember? I'm all veggiefied! You said it yourself, it's just a coma. You B, your the one who you've been killing."</p>
<p>"No...I'm fine."</p>
<p>Faith shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>"Your not fucking fine, you know it and I know it. You aren't even doing a good job of acting fine. All I want to do is help you, you have to let me in B!"</p>
<p>"LET YOU IN??? If you had listened to that, and let me in when it was you who needed help, none of this would have happened! You never let me in!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! That's the whole point! I needed help and you were there to give it to me but I never let you in! If only I had! That's something I have to live with! Something I have to regret!"</p>
<p>"Why did you write that letter then? You could have told me that stuff! WHY! Things could have been different."</p>
<p>"No B, they couldn't have. That's what I'm saying! We can't change the past, you have to stop dwelling. Deal and move on. What your doing...It's wicked bad B. Self-destruction. Look where it got me! Learn from my mistakes!!"</p>
<p>"Faith...I got you there. It's MY fault."</p>
<p>"Buffy, don't be so goddamn self-centered! It's not you fault! Everything is not your fault! You can't always save everyone! Look at you! Save yourself while you still can!"</p>
<p>Faith calmed down, and spoke in a more subdued tone.</p>
<p>"Help yourself B! I want you to still be there for me when I get out of here!"</p>
<p>Buffy was hysterical again. Faith walked over to her and took her into a warm embrace. She stroked her blonde hair gently.</p>
<p>"BUFFY! I don't blame you for any of this so don't blame yourself."</p>
<p>Faith raised Buffy's chin and looked deep into her dull eyes that were once a brilliant green.</p>
<p>"Get it through your thick skull!"</p>
<p>Faith smiled, leaned in and kissed Buffy passionately. Buffy was startled but soon kissed her back hungrily.</p>
<p>It was Faith who started the kiss and Faith who ended it. She pulled away from Buffy and stood up.</p>
<p>"I have to go B. See you soon."</p>
<p>Buffy had to think about all of this. Faith really didn't blame her? Faith wanted her to move on? Faith was going to get out?</p>
<p>It was then that Buffy woke up. It had all been a dream. Did what Faith said extend into consciousness? Was it all something Buffy had dreamed up? Something she wanted to be real so badly, that she started to dream it?</p>
<p>'Why? Why do I torture myself like this? Why can't I dream about flowers and gardens? Cats? Rabbits? Anything but Faith!' She thought, on the edge of hysteria once again.</p>
<p>It was dark outside, probably around 2:30 in the morning. Buffy dragged herself up to her room. That was when she remembered the powder.</p>
<p>'Just one taste. I can stop whenever, it's no big.' She told herself.</p>
<p>After finishing off what was left of the bag, the pleasure again took over. Replacing all the pain and anguish she had inside.</p>
<p>This time Buffy was walking through a garden. Colorful flowers surrounded her and she was soon standing on the bank of a crystal clear lake. She got on her knees to look at the fancy fish that swam by. When she did she saw a face looking up at her. She soon recognized it as Faith's.</p>
<p>"Faith...come up Faith, you'll drown." Buffy said, now frantic.</p>
<p>Faith just smiled up at Buffy, not moving.</p>
<p>Buffy reached down to save her, to pull her up. As she did the beautiful image of Faith turned ugly. Her face became the guise of a vampire and as Buffy reached in she grabbed her arm and pulled her under the water.</p>
<p>Buffy struggled but couldn't get away. She felt herself go lightheaded, she knew she didn't have long. Vampire Faith laughed as Buffy struggled.</p>
<p>Again Buffy crashed. This time in her room, she was on her bed and in an icy-cold sweat.</p>
<p>She had to get out of there.</p>
<p>Buffy ran through her house, everything was a blur. She didn't recognize it at all.</p>
<p>Confusion, anxiety, pain, depression, rage. All of these emotions running through her at once. Just as she felt she would explode she collapsed on her kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Darkness consumed her, and she was out cold...again.</p>
<p align="center">--------------------Next Morning----------------------</p>
<p>Buffy awoke, still lying on the cold kitchen floor. What the hell had happened to her? Then bits of it came back.</p>
<p>The dream, finishing the drugs, the hallucinations, and finally the blind run through her own house. That was probably the scariest moment of her life.</p>
<p>Even after facing The Master, Angelus, Spike and Dru, her own mother in a state of madness, countless other demons and vampires, even an especially psychotic vamp without her powers! Not to mention The First, or The Mayor.</p>
<p>The scariest thing for her was running through her house that she had lived in for 3 years having no idea where she was or who she was, and being totally out of control.</p>
<p>None of the other demons could compare to the fear that that struck deep within her. Into the furthest depths of her soul, and into the darkest recesses of her mind. That was the worst. Not even her own death was as terrifying as that.</p>
<p>And yet, as most people with a problem she didn't go to the root of it. She blamed the whole experience on stress and nerves. Forcing the possiblity of the mysterious powder being the cause out of her mind.</p>
<p>The powder made her feel good. She had good thoughts and good feelings when she snorted it. Her body felt warm and her heart raced. Pleasure shot through her and she knew she could do anything.</p>
<p>The depression, the pain and fear, the anxiety and paranoia, waking up cold not knowing where she was, that was all something else. Something totally different and unrelated.</p>
<p>Buffy went up to her room to get dressed. Again she picked somthing so utterly uncharicteristic it almost made her wonder.</p>
<p>Black jeans, a black tanktop, Faith's steeltoes, and Faith's leather jacket.</p>
<p>She crammed the cash her mother had left into her pocket and went downstairs. She found her mom's car keys and walked out.</p>
<p>Giving one quick glance towards her answering machiene as she left. There were 27 new messages, and undoubtly they were all from Giles.</p>
<p>'Screw him.'</p>
<p>She slammed the door shut behind her.</p>
<p>"Thanks for taking a taxi mom, ever so efficent of you. And thanks for the money, this is an emergency if I've ever seen one." Buffy said aloud to herself in a voice so cheery it was frightening.</p>
<p>The tires squeeled as the jeep sped out of the driveway in reverse, nearly missing a parked car. The rest of the trip continued this way, Buffy driving to fast, the tires making altogether to much noise, lights being narrowly made.</p>
<p>That is, it continued untill her destination was reached. And then all to quickly the car was shut off and Buffy almost flew up the steps of the dirty old apartment.</p>
<p>She made her way to the same room the guy had been in last time and knocked on the door, hard.</p>
<p>The guy opened the door slowly, eyeing Buffy with caution untill he realized that she was the same girl he had given a bag to just a short while ago.</p>
<p>"Back for more already? That's what I like to see!"</p>
<p>Buffy pushed past him and into the dingey room.</p>
<p>"Shut up and give me what I want."</p>
<p>The guy whistled appreciatively.</p>
<p>"I like a girl who knows what she wants."</p>
<p>Buffy gave him a disgusted look, he went into the other room and again came back with the mysterious briefcase of goodies.</p>
<p>"Did you like what I gave you last time?"</p>
<p>"Do you think I would come to this shithole for any other reason?" Buffy said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>They guy feigned hurt.</p>
<p>"I thought my looks would be enough to bring you back."</p>
<p>Buffy shot him another look and he opened up the case.</p>
<p>"Ok, so do you want the same thing or somthing a little stronger?"</p>
<p>"I want the exact same thing. Give it to me now, and save yourself alot of trouble. Don't, and well..."</p>
<p>"Ok-ok."</p>
<p>He pulled out another baggie with white powder, similar to the last one only a little bit smaller.</p>
<p>"This stuff is even better than what I gave you last time, but it's gonna cost."</p>
<p>"How much?"</p>
<p>The guy looked her up and down aprehensively.</p>
<p>"50. That's it. It's a good deal..."</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>Buffy pulled the money out and gave it to him. She grabbed the baggie from him and left. She shoved it into her pocket, got into the jeep and sped off.</p>
<p>She hadn't gotten far when a craving hit her. She wanted to sniff it. Just a little, but she didn't want to wait.</p>
<p>Her slayer senses were working over time and the addiction had set in much faster than it would have on a normal person.</p>
<p>Buffy pulled the jeep off the road and into the gas station parking lot. She hopped out of the vehicle and went inside. She retrieved the key and went into the freestanding washroom.</p>
<p>Buffy poured all of the powder out onto the counter by the sink. Rechecking the door to make sure it was locked, she went back to the counter.</p>
<p>She no longer required a straw, she just bent over the lines she had made and snorted them up.</p>
<p>Again her nose hurt for a few moments and she rubbed it repeatedly.</p>
<p>As she went back into the gas station to return the key the attendant eyed her suspiciously, but this being Sunnydale he quickly moved on to other things.</p>
<p>Buffy slowly walked back to her jeep, everything was again blurry and her eyes were very red and bloodshot. She tossed the now empty bag into the glovebox and started the car.</p>
<p>The drugs hadn't improved her driving and she nearly hit several people. She managed to make it to the hospital and walked in. A nurse approached her.</p>
<p>"Excuse me ma'am, the emergency room is thatway."</p>
<p>The lady pointed down another hall.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, I'm here to see a friend."</p>
<p>Buffy stagered into Faith's room and shut the door.</p>
<p>Again pleasure filled her and she saw the colors. The colors she could touch. Buffy slowly walked around the room, feeling as if she were flying. Beautiful music filled her head and she wandered over to Faith.</p>
<p>"Faith...that's you I know it is. This time I know for real. For real it's you"</p>
<p>Her speech was slurred and her speech patterns were erratic.</p>
<p>"Ohh Faith...Faith Faith FAITH! I wish you could be here with me now, and see what I see. You'd like it very much. Very very much. I like it, so you'd you...you, umm I forget what I was going to say."</p>
<p>She started to laugh hysterically.</p>
<p>Buffy walked around for a few more minutes and then flopped into a chair by Faith's bed.</p>
<p>Again the crash came.</p>
<p>"No...no leave me alone. NO!!" She screamed.</p>
<p>Buffy stood up and started to spin around, shadow boxing with somthing that really wasn't there. Whatever it was existed only in her mind.</p>
<p>Faith's eyes opened very slowly. She tried to speak but couldn't. The site of Buffy was very confusing. Faith remembered.</p>
<p>She remembered being stabbed and jumping, she remembered the dream...infact she remembered all the dreams. Buffy was in trouble. Lot's of trouble.</p>
<p>Hearing screams the doctors came running. To their shock they saw a blonde girl running around, tripping over her own feet and shouting at someone invisable, all the while swinging her fists violently.</p>
<p>Several of the larger male nurses tried to restrain her, but couldn't. She was un-naturally strong.</p>
<p>Finally she collapesed onto the floor, and the managed to pick her up, in the hallway they quickly placed her on a gurney and ran her down to emergency.</p>
<p>"We have a 12-114 cocaine overdose heading into emerge, have a bed and the doctors ready!"</p>
<p>Was all she heard someone shout before the now welcome darkness overtook her. Yet again.</p>
