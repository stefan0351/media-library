<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Come Away with Me -->

<p>"Where's the happy couple?" Nicole asked her Latina lover as
she entered the kitchen to the smell of Lily's special egg-free
omelets. They weren't Nicole's favorite, and knowing this, Lily had
a plate of pancakes and bacon nearby. Since they'd gotten together,
Lily had started getting Nicole to eat more and healthier. While the
blonde wasn't happy at the few pounds that appeared, she agreed with
Lily that her health was more important than her image.</p>
<p>Lily smiled.</p>
<p>"Sam and Brooke? Still in their room as far as I know," she
answered.</p>
<p>"Pair of rabbits, I tell you," Nicole huffed as she picked up
a strip of bacon.</p>
<p>"Yes, and that's why we put their rooms on the other side of
the house," Lily laughed. Nicole hugged her around the middle from
behind and nuzzled the darker girl's neck.</p>
<p>"Mmmm, B can get a little loud," she purred into Lily's ear.</p>
<p>"No, WE can get a little loud and you didn't want them to
hear us, remember?" she leaned back into Nicole's embrace and then
turned around to kiss her passionately.</p>
<p>"Good Lord, get a room," Sam scoffed as she entered the room
and headed straight for the bacon still steaming on a nearby
plate. "You've got like, 35 empty ones to chose from."</p>
<p>"Shut up, Spam," Nicole growled as she held Lily in mock
possessiveness. Sam held her arms up in surrender and continued to
eat the bacon.</p>
<p>"Where's Brookie? Or did you break her?" Nicole wondered
when Brooke didn't appear for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"I'm here," Brooke yawned. She was dressed only in a long
shirt, socks and her underwear. Her hair was tousled and her eyes
were slightly red and puffy. Nicole frowned and shot a questioning
look at Sam who was fighting with the cat, Triscuit, for a strip of
bacon.</p>
<p>"Nightmares," Sam mouthed back. Nicole nodded in
understanding. </p>
<p>Since the awful confrontation with Mike a week earlier, Jane
had gone on `vacation' with Terri to Terri's home in Texas, taking
toddler Mac with them while Sam and Brooke opted to stay with Nicole
and Lily. Everyone needed a break from the stress and thought that
just getting away would be best for Jane and staying under Mike's
radar would work for Brooke and Sam.</p>
<p>But it was obvious that Brooke was still bothered by her
father's scene at the house. </p>
<p>"I'm not hungry, Sammy," Brooke sighed when Sam offered her
the plate. Undeterred, Sam prepared a plate of pancakes the way
Brooke liked them, heavy on syrup, and handed the plate to the tall
blonde.</p>
<p>"At least half, Brooke," Sam said firmly as she poured two
glasses of orange juice and sat down. Pouting, Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"So, what are you two up to today?" Lily asked, joining the
duo and Nicole at the kitchen table. She watched as Brooke dutifully
chewed her breakfast under Sam's watchful eye. Lily knew that there
was a time when under such stress, Brooke would have collapsed into
herself and reverted totally to her self-destructive pattern of
eating disorders as a way of finding control in some aspect of her
life. And without Sam as her anchor, Brooke would fall so far down
that hole that Lily doubted she'd be able to find her way back out
again.</p>
<p>&lt;Sam takes such good care of her&gt; Lily smiled to herself.
&lt;It's so easy to see the love she has for her in everything she
does. And the love Brooke has for Sam is obvious too. I only wonder
though?as much as Brooke loves Sam?is she able to see that Sam's
bothered by all this too?&gt; She shook her head.</p>
<p>&lt;I shouldn't think like that. Of course Brooke is aware of
that haunted look in Sam's eyes. Anyone can see it. Even Nic
mentioned it to me last night. It's just?I hope Brooke isn't relying
so heavily on Sam that she overlooks Sam's pain&gt;</p>
<p>Nicole nudged Lily in the shoulder.</p>
<p>"What's on your mind, hon?" she asked. Lily shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nothing," she whispered back. Nicole gave her her
patented `yeah right' look but let it drop.</p>
<p>"I don't think we have any plans, do we, Brooke?" Sam asked
in answer to the earlier question. Brooke swirled a mouthful of
pancake around in syrup and shook her head.</p>
<p>"Nope, just another lazy Saturday staying in and watching
movies," Brooke responded. "You?"</p>
<p>"Actually, we're taking you two out!" Nicole suddenly
announced. She was tired of all this moping around the house,
hiding. "We're young, we're rich, we're pretty?even Sam?" she added
belatedly, earning herself a thump on both arms, one from Lily and
the other from Brooke. "So let's DO something."</p>
<p>"Like what?" Sam asked, watching Brooke finish off her entire
plate of food.</p>
<p>&lt;I knew if I just got her to start eating that she'd probably
finish it on her own&gt; Sam thought. Her own stomach constricted and
rebelled against the bacon she'd fed it earlier but she did the best
she could to ignore it. She was having trouble keeping food down
lately and it was starting to worry her. She didn't want to say
anything to Brooke and add more worry to the blonde's already
overburdened mind.</p>
<p>"Let's see?there's a Hepburn and Tracy movie marathon at the
Cineplex that starts at noon," Lily suggested. "We can catch dinner
afterwards."</p>
<p>Sam's stomach did a barrel roll at the mere suggestion of
food but she nodded.</p>
<p>"Works for me," she ground out past her nausea. She stood up
and put Brooke's plate in the sink. "I'm going to go grab a shower."
Three pairs of eyes watched her hasty retreat.</p>
<p>"Is she OK, Brooke?" Nicole asked bluntly, having seen the
green tint to Sam's complexion. Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, yeah," she responded. "She's Sam?and by
nature still doesn't tell me a lot about what's going on in her head."</p>
<p>"Well, keep an eye on her, Brooke. Don't just assume she's
doing fine, all right?" Nicole advised while Lily nodded her
agreement. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam flushed the toilet, lit her favorite melon-cucumber
candles and turned on the shower while trying to get her racing
heartbeat to calm down and her shakes to stop.</p>
<p>&lt;Ew, bacon revisited?not pleasant&gt; she sighed. She stripped
out of her pj's and climbed into the scalding hot shower. She closed
her eyes and just stood under the spray, letting the world fall away
for a few minutes and simply breathed.</p>
<p>She was so far into her thoughts that she jumped when the
shower door slid open and Brooke stepped inside.</p>
<p>"Mind if I join you?" the blonde asked shyly. Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"Not at all." Brooke closed the door and then wrapped her
arms around Sam. The brunette's skin was shower hot but there were
tremors running through her body that alarmed Brooke.</p>
<p>"Sammy, you're shaking," she whispered softly. She felt Sam
shrug.</p>
<p>"I'm cold. You brought in a draft," Sam bluffed. She hoped
Brooke bought it.</p>
<p>"You know I'm here for you, Sammy," Brooke nuzzled Sam's wet
hair. "I know things with my Dad are stressful for all of us, not
just me. I know it is for you too. Please don't shut me out, hon."</p>
<p>"I'm not," Sam assured her lover. She brushed some of
Brooke's wet hair out of her face. "I'm just not feeling 100% but I'm
fine. I swear."</p>
<p>Brooke kissed Sam's neck and held her tight as more shudders
ran up and down the shorter girl's slight frame.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke's voice was almost begging. "Please stop
shaking." Sam silently pulled away and got out the shampoo,
proceeding to soap up Brooke's hair and then her own.</p>
<p>They finished their shower in silence and got out. Sam blew
out the candles before following Brooke into their bedroom. She
looked forlornly at the bed, feeling tired and wanting a nap but knew
that Nicole wouldn't allow it.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you want to go to the movies, Sammy?" Brooke
asked softly as she dried and got dressed. She'd seen the tired look
on Sam's face as well as the longing look the brunette had shot at
the bed. "I can tell Nicole that you don't feel well today and we'll
all do something another day." Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"I'm fine. Besides, you love those old movies and we'll have
a good time," Sam shot her a small smile. "Let's just go out and be
teenagers for a day."</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me, Sammy."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The four arrived at the Cineplex and while Nicole and Sam got
their tickets, Lily and Brooke went to get snacks. </p>
<p>Nicole took a long, hard look at Sam and arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"OK, Spam, spill," she demanded, although her tone of voice
was concerned and not bitchy. Sam leveled her even gaze on her
smaller companion and stared back blankly.</p>
<p>"Spill? I'm sorry, I'm not up to date on my Spam-to-Satan
translations lately. Wanna try that again?" Nicole's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"What's up with you lately?" Nicole asked outright. "You're
like this ghost haunting the house at all hours. You're not
sleeping, you hardly eat. Don't look at me like I've suddenly
sprouted a Foxxy Cleopatra afro. Lily notices these things and
points them out to me. I'm then obligated to smack you back to
reality like Russell Crowe in a bar fight."</p>
<p>"I'm fine, Nicole. I'm just worried about Brooke," Sam said
tiredly. Although inwardly the visual of Nicole with an afro was
rather humorous and made her smile.</p>
<p>"Yeah, right," Nicole sneered somewhat. "And I'm a
heterosexual man."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>In line at the concessions stand, Lily bounced on the balls
of her feet as she eyed Brooke.</p>
<p>"Brooke, you'rekeepinganeyeonSam, right?" she ran all her
words together nervously. She was slightly afraid of pissing the
tall blonde off. Brooke frowned and reran the Latina's question in
her head at half speed until it made sense.</p>
<p>"Actually, I'm keeping both eyes on her," Brooke smiled half-heartedly at Lily. "Yes, Lily, I know that there's something going on
inside that beautiful head of hers that she's not letting me in on.
Part of being with Sam is dealing with her emotional walls and being
patient with her. I'm trying to do that now."</p>
<p>"OK," Lily said meekly. "I'm sorry." Brooke put her hand on
Lily's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't be. I think it's sweet that you care and it's
reassuring to know that there's someone else looking out for the two
of us. You and Nicole are great friends, Lily. Don't ever be sorry
for being worried about someone."</p>
<p>Lily smiled brightly and stepped up to place their order.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Halfway into the large bag of popcorn, Brooke noticed two
things:</p>
<p>1) Sam hadn't touched the popcorn or her soda and;<br>
2) Sam was sound asleep with her head on Brooke's shoulder.</p>
<p>She thought it was so cute the way Sam was completely out and let her
stay that way all the way through `Woman of the Year', `Adam's Rib',
and halfway though `Desk Set'. Sam sat up and blinked blearily for
the ending and all of `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?'</p>
<p>When it was over, they all stood and stretched. Lily's stomach
rumbled and she blushed.</p>
<p>"Anyone for a late dinner?" she wondered. Nicole and Brooke nodded
while Sam just shrugged and put her hands in her pockets.</p>
<p>"There's this great little place not far from here," Nicole
added. "Quiet, has music and a dance floor. It's not a club, just a
romantic off the beaten path place. Wanna try it?"</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke asked trying to catch Sam's eye. Sam's stomach was
cramping and the last thing she wanted was to eat but she nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure," she tried to force enthusiasm. She wasn't sure it
worked though. Brooke looked at her concerned for a minute and then
turned to Nicole.</p>
<p>"Lead the way."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole was right, Alcove was a small, intimate little
restaurant with just the right atmosphere for the mood they were all
in. They each ordered dinner; Brooke ordered a salad and grilled
chicken, Lily a veggie rueben, Nicole a house steak and Sam got a
small plate of spaghetti. Conversation was light, consisting of talk
about graduation and college, how fast MacKenzie was growing and
other nonsense that teenage girls talk about.</p>
<p>But out of the corner of her eye, Brooke watched as Sam
merely pushed her food around her plate, managing to swallow only a
few mouthfuls before giving up.</p>
<p>"Come on, Sammy, let's go dance," she pulled on a reluctant
Sam's arm. Sam got up and followed her girlfriend to the small
wooden dance floor where only a handful of other couples were dancing
slowly to the piano music filling the room.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy," Brooke sighed as she laid her head on Sam's
shoulder. "You need to eat more. You think I don't see but I do."</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam started, a hint of a far off warning in her
tone. "I've got a bug of some sort. I'll be fine in a day or so."</p>
<p>"Why are you pushing me away?" Brooke asked obviously
wounded. "You're not sick, it's something else. Talk to me, Sam."
Sam pulled away roughly.</p>
<p>"Damn it, Brooke, stop pushing!" she growled. "Just leave it
alone!" She then stalked away leaving Brooke alone on the dance
floor. Brooke watched Sam head for the door with tears in her hazel
eyes, wanting nothing more than to reach out to her brunette love and
heal whatever was wrong but she knew she needed to give Sam some
space. She returned to the table defeated.</p>
<p>"Oh, Brookie?" Nicole sighed. "Let me go kick her ass."
Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, Nic, she's right. I pushed when I shouldn't have." She
ran a tired hand through her blonde hair. "It's just?I hate leaving
things hanging?knowing that there's something bothering her.
Especially when I know that it's my Dad that's bothering her and the
whole mess we're in. I want to talk about it, talk it out and figure
out what we're going to do but Sam?Sam likes to internalize and think
to herself and swallow everything. It makes for hard going."</p>
<p>"Gee, I don't know anyone like that," Lily snorted. Nicole
shot her a dirty look but ignored the jab.</p>
<p>They sat quietly thinking about everything that Brooke had
said when soft piano music filled the room. Brooke jumped when
someone tapped her gently on the shoulder. She looked up at Sam's
apologetic face.</p>
<p>"Dance with me?" Sam asked. Brooke nodded and stood up.</p>
<p>"I asked them to play this song for us," Sam whispered. "I'm
so sorry I blew up like that, Brooke. I just?I don't feel well
lately. It's making me tired."</p>
<p>"It's OK, Sammy. You were right. I shouldn't have pushed
like that. But you will talk to me when you're ready, right?" She
felt Sam nod against her.</p>
<p>"Of course, love," Sam sighed happily. Content with that
response for now, Brooke started to listen to the lyrics of the song
and moved with Sam to the slow beat.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">`Come away with me in the night<br>
Come away with me<br>
And I will write you a song</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Come away with me on a bus<br>
Come away where they can't tempt us<br>
With their lies'</font></p>
<p>Quietly, just above the music, Brooke could hear Sam singing along in
her ear. Sam had such a sweet voice when she sang and Brooke felt
that she didn't share it often enough. And she understood that this
was Sam's way of apology.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">`I want to walk with you <br>
On a cloudy day<br>
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high<br>
So won't you try to come</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Come away with me and we'll kiss<br>
On a mountaintop<br>
Come away with me<br>
And I'll never stop loving you'</font></p>
<p>It was a beautiful song, Brooke realized. She hadn't really heard it
before.</p>
<p>"Who is this by, Sam?" she whispered softly.</p>
<p>"Norah Jones," Sam supplied. `I have the CD at home if you want to
listen to it sometime."</p>
<p>"I'd like that, Sammy."</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">`And I want to wake up with the rain<br>
Falling on a tin roof<br>
While I'm safe there in your arms<br>
So all I ask is for you<br>
To come away with me in the night<br>
Come away with me'</font></p>
<p>Nearby at their table, Nicole and Lily sat holding hands and watching
the dancing duo.</p>
<p>"Think they're going to be all right?" Lily asked as she leaned back
into Nicole's embrace.</p>
<p>"I'd bet my entire inheritance on it, Lil. Those two are lost
without each other. Same as I'm lost without you." Lily tilted her
head to capture a kiss.</p>
<p>"I want to go home, Nicole," Lily purred. Nicole smiled.</p>
<p>"I'll leave B the keys. Let's go grab a cab, hon." Lily nodded and
followed Nicole as the short blonde paid the check and explained that
they were leaving to their waiter and left the keys to the car for
Brooke who was still wrapped up in Sam on the dance floor.</p>
<p>&lt;Yeah, everyone's going to be just fine&gt; Lily smiled as she watched
Brooke wipe away a stray tear from Sam's face.</p>
<p>&lt;As long as Sam let's Brooke in?everything will work out&gt;</p>
