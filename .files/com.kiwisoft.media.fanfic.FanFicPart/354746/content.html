<!-- Blood \ Chapter 8 -->

<P>The women now walked the halls of Voyager, both having freshened up as much as they were able, but they held their wounded cheeks high in a mutual unconscious effort. "We should get that looked at." While they kept walked Seven turned her head slightly and arched her brow at the remark. The familiar gesture a seeming contrast with a world where everything had seemed to have changed for both of the women, and a physical contrast as the still scabbing wound moved with the motion. "It is already being "looked at"." B'Elanna laughed at that. "We should head to sickbay." Seven seemed to consider that and nodded as they made their way to a turbolift.</P>
<P>As the doors opened and the car emptied the women were smirking as they were stared at. Stepping into the now empty car they turned to each other. B'Elanna seemed to be laughing to herself. "Well this should be around the ship with in the next five minutes. Though I'm surprised they didn't hear us earlier." Her complexion reddened. "We weren't very quiet." Seven smiled. "I erected force fields to insure our privacy." B'Elanna seemed stunned. "Seven! You seduced me!" "Yes. Do you object?" Torres squared her shoulders. "Well, no." B'Elanna started giggling. "Chakotay suggested I explore my feelings for you. I don't think this is what he had in mind."</P>
<P>Seven smirked. "You simply decided to explore your feelings by exploring me." B'Elanna blushed even deeper as Seven continued. "Captain Janeway gave me similar advice." B'Elanna grinned at her. "To explore your feelings or to explore me?" Her last two words were heard as the turbolift door opened and the crewman waiting outside turned bright red. Seven took the hand of a giggling Torres who seemed able to only shrug at the crewman. "I'm glad it was Janeway and Chakotay who gave us the advice so they may only demote us when they find out." They stopped just short of sickbay. "Why would they concern themselves?" B'Elanna stepped close. "We went way beyond fraternizing while on duty." "We were on break." Torres seemed taken back. "We were?" Seven nodded. "I was very precise in my scheduling."</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded. "So you were." She then smiled as the two of them stepped into sickbay. They looked around and noticed they were alone so Seven spoke up. "Computer, activate the Emergency Medical Hologram." A flickering hologram resolved itself. "Please state the nature of the medical emergency." B'Elanna stepped forward. "No emergency really." The Doctor quickly stepped forward. "Seven, B'Elanna? What happened?" The two women stared at the Doctor purposefully and the hologram's shoulders slumped. "Well, I guess congratulations are in order. Are you here for treatment or to inform Mr. Paris?" B'Elanna looked around the room again. "Tom is supposed to be here isn't he?" The Doctor was picking up a dermal regenerator, but Torres topped him for a moment.</P>
<P>"Just clean and bandage mine." Seven spoke. "Mine as well." The Doctor nodded. "Very well, as far as Mister Paris he, is SUPPOSED to be here, but if the shift is quiet enough he has taken to sneaking out early. If you are looking for him I would suggest checking the holodecks." Torres shook her head. "That explains him putting me off several times the past few weeks. He said he had started a project in the holodeck and was right in the middle of it." The EMH seemed back to normal. "You snooze, you loose I guess. So what are you going to do about Tom?" Seven had been simply observed the conversation up to this point. "As B'Elanna's mate I am entitled to challenge him as my competitor." B'Elanna smiled fondly. "Tom is no competition for you, and I think the Captain would object to the sudden loss of her helmsman."</P>
<P>Seven seemed totally calm as the Doctor moved to clean her wound. "I could assimilate him. His skill would still be available." B'Elanna noticed the slight curve of Seven's lips. "No, the idea of you assimilating any of his distinctiveness is just TOO upsetting." The Doctor looked up and saw both women grinning. "Hold still please." Torres lost her smile as she continued. "I will have to deal with Tom. No matter how much he neglected me we were in a relationship and he deserves to know it is over." She then stood still as the Doctor moved to treat her. "We'll go by my quarters and freshen up then I'll go find Tom." Seven nodded. "I will accompany you. We may also want to speak to the captain and first officer before they gain the information from another source."</P>
<P>B'Elanna noticeably kept herself from nodding. "That's a very good idea. It will be better if they hear it from us. We can freshen up, talk to them, and then go find Tom. Though you should probably wait outside." Seven seemed reluctant but her expression said she agreed. The Doctor closed his instruments. "There you are. Would you like me to prepare a small medikit for the both of you? I could put it in a plain brown wrapper." The two women just stared at him. They then turned and left sickbay, not hearing the Doctor sigh after they left and speak. "Computer. deactivate the Emergency Medical Hologram."</P>
