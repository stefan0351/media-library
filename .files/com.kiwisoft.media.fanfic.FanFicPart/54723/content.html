<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 14: Bribery and Corruption-->

<p>Willow watched Buffy from her lounging position in the Bronze. Buffy was in line to get drinks. Four days after the Council’s "test" her strength returned. One day, the door to her house had been stuck, so she kept turning the knob. Out of frustration, she broke it clean off the door.</P>
<p>If the knob hadn’t broken, she wouldn’t have realized her ability had come back to her. Willow knew what her distraction was, because she had the same problem. They were both on Cloud Nine since their intimate night together. The whole world seemed to disappear before their eyes. </P>
<p>They had become closer, and they had thought that impossible, but it happened. Willow didn’t know if it had something to do with Buffy’s slayerness or something else, but she seemed to know what Buffy was thinking, and vice versa. It was more an emotional connection that just seemed to keep growing. The more it did, the more words were unnecessary. Looking into each other’s eyes had suddenly become a whole conversation. </P>
<p>And that was the difference between love and sex. Sex stopped at the physical end, but making love encompassed everything. Mind, body, and soul. Willow wouldn’t have believed people who told her that. Not if she hadn’t experienced it herself. And now it was like everything else didn’t matter.</P>
<p><I>‘School matters.’ </I>She reminded herself.</P>
<p>What didn’t seem to matter was the Hellmouth, Vampires, all the problems went away. She knew she’d have to face the warped reality that was her life eventually, but right now she was avoiding it at all costs.</P>
<p>As Buffy started to come over with the drinks, Willow saw her freeze up. Wondering what was wrong, Willow tried to find the source of the problem. The problem was in front of her. Towering over her it seemed. </P>
<p>"Hiya, Red."</P>
<p>Willow drew in a breath. Faith was one problem she wished she hadn’t forgotten about.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy immediately dropped the two cups of scalding hot mocha on the floor, and ran up behind Faith. The other slayer sensed her this time, and crouched. Buffy’s punch missed, and the strength that was behind it knocked her off balance. Surprisingly enough, Faith was the one who stopped her fall.</P>
<p>"I was already knocked out by you once, B. I’d like to avoid it this time. Look, I know I was somewhat…rude before, and I’m sorry. We five-by-five?"</P>
<p><I>‘What’s with the act?’ </I> Buffy and Willow thought at the same time.</P>
<p>"Back away from Willow."</P>
<p>"You think I was gonna hurt my buddy over here?"</P>
<p>"I’m not your buddy." Willow said adamantly.</P>
<p>"Even after all the quality time we spent together? I’m hurt, really."</P>
<p>Buffy kept her anger under control.</P>
<p>"What do you want, Faith?"</P>
<p>"Patrol, remember? I mean now that you’re back to full power, we’ve got a job to do."</P>
<p>"I…already did my sweep tonight."</P>
<p>Both Buffy and Willow were a little scared now. Faith had known Buffy had lost her strength?</P>
<p>"Well, I’m sure there’s some more roaming around somewhere. Someone once told me, something about vamps. They said, ‘They'll hit a street even after you've been there.’ Who could it be? You don’t know, do you?"</P>
<p><I>‘Damn you.’ </I>Buffy thought.</P>
<p>"Let’s go."</P>
<p>Willow looked at Buffy. She knew what Buffy wanted, it was written all over her face. It said, ‘Go get everyone, and hurry.’ As soon Faith and Buffy left the Bronze, Willow walked out, heading in the opposite direction that she saw them go.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Faith and Buffy walked through the graveyard. There had been no sign of any vampires at all. But Faith seemed hyped on acting, so Buffy went along with it. She wanted to see where it led.</P>
<p>After about ten more minutes, Buffy had had enough. She stopped walking.</P>
<p>"Okay, Faith. Drop it."</P>
<p>Faith faced her. "Drop what?"</P>
<p>"The dutiful slayer act."</P>
<p>"Dutiful?"</P>
<p>"We know, Faith, so just spare me, okay?"</P>
<p>"Oh, you don’t know the half of it, B."</P>
<p>"Then why don’t you tell me?"</P>
<p>"Now if I wanted to tell you, I could’ve done that awhile ago. But seeing as how I haven’t, do you really think I’m gonna spill?"</P>
<p>"Then what’re we doing out here? Look, if you wanna kill me, let’s get started. Otherwise, I’m leaving."</P>
<p>Faith walked up to Buffy and whispered to her.</P>
<p>"If I wanted to kill you, I would’ve done it when you were throwing girlie punches." Faith backed away. "Actually, I wanted to kill you, but the boss had another idea."</P>
<p>"And what’s that?"</P>
<p>"Come join the winning team."</P>
<p>"Don’t think so."</P>
<p>"Then kill me."</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"You heard me. You know that from now on I’ll come after you, so the only way you’ll get rid of me is to kill me. Come on." Buffy looked at the ground. "You can’t can you? You can’t kill a person."</P>
<p>"Of course not."</P>
<p>"Then that’s why you’ll lose. You think humans are any better than demons? Am I better than a demon?"</P>
<p>"Yes."</P>
<p>Faith was shocked for a moment.</P>
<p>"You know I’m not on your side, so why are you still…"</P>
<P>Buffy finally realized something that should have occurred to her long ago.	</P>
<P>"Because you haven’t done anything wrong. Yet."</P>
<p>"Excuse me?"</P>
<p>"I’m sure you’ve killed tons of demons, right? Whoever this boss is, he must have tons of enemies that need to be taken out. But not once has he asked you to kill a human. Has he Faith?"</P>
<p>"Sure he has." Faith said with some uncertainty in her eyes. "You."</P>
<p>"Oh, right. Me. You could’ve killed me. You knew I lost my strength, right? You could’ve killed me easily then. Not to mention Willow, or Giles, or Xander. But you didn’t. And you know why?"</P>
<p>Buffy stepped up to her.</P>
<p>"Because you can’t. Even as rebellious as you may think you are, somebody must have done something right, because you’ve never killed a human being. You know killing a person is murder, and you can’t do that. It’s built into Slayers."</P>
<p>"What about my Watcher?"</P>
<p>"Oh, you never killed her. In fact, I’m sure you were close. You can’t help but bond with your Watcher. Kakistos killed her like you said. Out of a need to survive you joined up with him, because you knew you’d never beat him. Over time, you became so cold and distant that you convinced yourself that dealing with vampires was the way to go. You probably even blocked out the real truth of what happened.</P>
<p>"When you came here and told us your story, I knew it was true, but I could tell you were trying to hide the truth of your words from yourself. You’ve been surrounded by an evil influence for so long that you can’t even trust yourself or your own memories anymore. You knew we cared about you, and it scared you. That’s why you didn’t kill us. Nobody has cared about you for a long time, have they?"</P>
<p>Faith shrugged the question off, and tried to make her face as expressionless as possible.</P>
<p>"How do you know you’re right?"</P>
<p>"I’ve seen killers eyes. I looked into them every time I looked into Angel’s. There was so much pain, anguish, and rage he focused on himself. There were things going on in his head that I couldn’t even begin to understand. When he became all demon again, the rage multiplied, and the joy of killing came back to him. It was all in his eyes. You don’t have the look.</P>
<p>"You have the eyes of someone lost, someone confused. Let us help you."</P>
<p>Faith was holding together, but in another second Buffy knew she was going to break.</P>
<p>"I have everything straight. The boss takes care of me, and that’s all that matters."</P>
<p>"Faith…"</P>
<p>Suddenly, several vampires jumped seemingly, from out of nowhere.</P>
<p>"You’re right, B. I can’t kill you. But they have no problems giving it a shot. If you’re still alive afterwards, the offer’s still on the table." Faith said, and ran off.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p><I>‘Damn. How does she know me so well?’ </I>Faith thought to herself as she ran off to her "apartment".</P>
<p>Buffy laid out her entire life in a matter of a few minutes. And it shocked her. Nobody had ever tried to figure her out. Well, the boss did. She liked him. He gave her free reign, gave her everything she asked for, and in his own way, cared for her. But she wasn’t close to him. She wouldn’t allow herself to get close to anyone. All they ended up doing was turning on you.</P>
<p><I>‘Buffy just thinks I’m a pity case. Screw her. She thinks she can tell me all about myself, and save me? She doesn’t care about me, she just thinks it’s her duty to rescue everyone from themselves.’</P>
</I><p>Faith quickened her pace, trying to block out all her emotions. They just confused things more. She didn’t see a person run her direction, and they ran into on another. They both fell to the ground, landing on their backsides.</P>
<p>Faith looked at the person. Willow.</P>
<p><I>‘Figures.’</P>
<p></I>Faith got up slowly, and Willow shot up. Faith could see everyone else running up towards them. Willow was shaking visibly. If it were any other time, she might have taken joy in Willow’s fear. She just stared at her.</P>
<p>"Don’t you have a friend to save?" She ran off.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Let’s see," Buffy said aloud in the middle of a circle of ten vampires, "how do I get out of this one?" </P>
<p>The vampires weren’t moving.</P>
<p><I>‘Gee, I love it when they let me make the first move.’</P>
<P> </I>	She saw a broken tree limb five feet in front of her. As she took a cautious step towards it, the vampires took two steps towards her. </P>
<p>"Ring around the Slayer. Great." Buffy muttered.</P>
<p>Just then, Xander barreled through two vampires, knocking them down, joining Buffy in the center. The vampires got up, and started to growl.</P>
<p>"Nice of you to make it." Buffy said as the vampires advanced.</P>
<p>"Glad to be here."</P>
<p>"You bring a weapon?"</P>
<p>"Weapon?" Buffy sighed. "At least I knocked them down."</P>
<p>"They got back up, Xander."</P>
<p>"Then I guess it’s a good thing vampires don’t play football. We’d have no chance in hell at the Superbowl."</P>
<p>Buffy got closer to Xander, as the vampires got continually closer as well.</P>
<p>"The guys with you?" He nodded. "What are they packing?"</P>
<p>"Crossbow, Super Soaker with holywater, stakes…"</P>
<p>She saw the branch again, and saw the tree, which it had fallen from. </P>
<p><I>‘Looks pretty sturdy.’</P>
<p></I>"I never thought I’d say this, but I need to get on top of you." Xander leered at her. "On your shoulders. I want you to pick up that tree branch. I’m going to jump from you to the tree up there to get higher. Take the branch, stake a guy, and get out. Got it?"</P>
<p>Xander grabbed the tree branch as the vampires rushed at them. Buffy kicked the closest one, sending him flying back into one of his buddies. Xander bent down, and Buffy quickly and expertly, planted her feet on his shoulders.</P>
<p>He stood up. With one hand he tried to balance her, while in the other hold the branch.</P>
<p>"Lots of pain." He grunted. "Could you hurry up and jump?"</P>
<p>"Sorry. Just be glad I don’t wear heels."</P>
<p>She seemed to rocket herself off, of Xander, and grabbed a particularly thick branch. She was above the circle and saw Xander fighting his way through the crowd. She flung herself up onto the limb, and into a standing position.</P>
<p>She saw Willow, Cordelia, Oz and Giles. Willow had the gun. Trying to get Willow’s attention she whistled. Willow looked up, and nodded. She started to fire the gun, and burned several vampires fighting her way to get to Xander.</P>
<p>He was doing okay, but the branch had long since vanished, dusted along with a vampire. Giles had the crossbow, and with more strength then Buffy thought he had, tossed the crossbow up to her.</P>
<p>She loaded the crossbow with a stake she had tied in her hair, and was trying to look for a good place to fire. Willow was nearly running out of ammunition, and Cordelia and Oz were trying to get Xander out of harm’s way.</P>
<p>She knew she was taking a risk, but she fired at a vampire that had Xander by the shirt. The vampire’s back was to her, and she fired. With accurate aim, the stake entered the vampire, and stayed lodged there, while it turned to ash.</P>
<p>The vampires were now turning their attention to the tree she was in. It was good for the gang, but bad for her. They all got around the tree, and started to shake it. Buffy was trying to keep her balance, but between her weight and the crossbow, the branch broke underneath her, and she and the branch landed on top of two vampires.</P>
<p>She groaned in pain at the fall, as the other vampires started to come over to her. The gang came over, and Willow held up the gun.</P>
<p>"You want this?" She asked.</P>
<p>The vampires looked at Buffy and then at the gun, and decided to run off. Willow helped Buffy up.</P>
<p>"You weren’t falling for me just now, were you?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"It’s customary when someone falls from an extremely high height to be concerned for that person’s well being."</P>
<p>"Are you okay, Buffy?"</P>
<p>"I’ll probably have a bad back when I hit thirty, but yes I am, thank you. And in case you haven’t noticed, I fell for you a long time ago."</P>
<p>Willow grinned.</P>
<p>"How much water did you have left in that thing?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"None. I was bluffing."</P>
<p>"Nice bluff." Buffy said walking towards Xander. "You okay?"</P>
<p>"For now. Pain comes later."</P>
<p>"Who let him barrel in like that?"</P>
<p>"No one." Oz said.</P>
<p>"We tried to –" Giles started.</P>
<p>"Stop him." Cordelia finished.</P>
<p>"But I’m the Xandinator. I cannot be stopped."</P>
<p>"Maybe not. But next time, a little suggestion?"  Buffy said.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"Use a better joke." Buffy and Willow said together.</P>
<p>They looked at one another, and then at the stares of the rest of the gang.</P>
<p>"One word – Eerie." Oz said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back at the library, Buffy had a heating pack pressed up against her back by Willow. Giles was reading, Cordelia was pressing a wet cloth on Xander’s forehead, and Oz was checking the lock on the book cage.</P>
<p>"Downside to being a wolf is definitely cages." Oz said. Tomorrow was the first night.</P>
<p>"Well, look at it this way. At least you’re not neutered." Xander said, as Oz just looked at him. "You’re not, are you?"</P>
<p>"Last time I checked, no."</P>
<p>"So you two know each other pretty well." Cordelia said, looking at Willow and Buffy.</P>
<p>"You could say that." Willow stuttered.</P>
<p>"And I was the last to know."</P>
<p>"Know what?" Giles asked without looking up from his book.</P>
<p>"Guess I’m not the last." Cordelia grinned, sensing a prime opportunity.</P>
<p>"Hey did any of you guys happen to see Faith as you were coming to get me?" Buffy asked, quickly redirecting the conversation.</P>
<p>"Yep." Willow responded eager to change topics as well. "We ran into each other."</P>
<p>"Like you just happened to –"</P>
<p>"She really ran, as in colliding, into her." Cordelia clarified.</P>
<p>"She just looked at me, then walked away. She looked sad." Willow said.</P>
<p>"I think we can help her." </P>
<p>"She’s a lost cause, Buffy." Xander said.</P>
<p>"She’s a confused cause. Giles what’s up with the Council and the Watcher?"</P>
<p>Giles looked up from the book he was reading.</P>
<p>"The Watcher is supposed to arrive very soon. Beyond that, the Council has told me nothing. Whatever they plan to do about Faith, or not do, I am not aware of." Giles said with a sad look.</P>
<p>Buffy gave him a reassuring smile. "You’ll always be my Watcher. I don’t want another one."</P>
<p>Giles smiled back in return. "Nevertheless, you must follow his rules. The Council has been very lenient with you Buffy. Mostly because I spoke on your behalf, but now that I am no longer influential, the slightest mistake on your part…"</P>
<p>"Will get me in trouble. I’m not so much worried about me as I am Faith. If they catch her, they’ll probably really punish her, right?"</P>
<p>"Most likely."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>At the airport, a young British man stepped out of the terminal. He went over to baggage claim. The first piece of luggage was a suitcase, which he got easily. He couldn’t find the second piece, which was a hardbound case.</P>
<p>He turned around, and saw a brown haired girl holding it in front of his face.</P>
<p>"Looking for this?"</P>
<p>"Yes, thank you."</P>
<p>She handed it over.</P>
<p>"Hey. You’re a Watcher, right?"</P>
<p>He was startled. "Who are you?"</P>
<p>"I think we’re in the same business. You got a name?"</P>
<p>"Wesley…Wesley Wyndam Pryce."</P>
<p>"A three name guy. You know I’ve heard rumors about guys with three names…I’d like to test them out."</P>
<p>He was flustered. "And you are?"</P>
<p>"Faith. We need to talk."</P>
<p>"About?"</P>
<p>"Buffy."</P>
<p>They walked out of the airport, Wesley hanging on her every word. </P>
