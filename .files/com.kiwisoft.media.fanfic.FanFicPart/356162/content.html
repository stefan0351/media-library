<!-- We'll Always Have Paris \ Chapter 7 -->

<p>With a groan Seven rolled off B'Elanna and flopped onto her back.  B'Elanna covered her face with her hands, unsure whether to laugh, cry or scream.  In the end they both got up and attended to Kate's needs.  Neither one of them seemed capable of looking at or talking to the other.  Once Kate was fed and happily playing in the living room B'Elanna went into the kitchen to rinse out the bottle.  She was standing at the sink when she heard Seven come into the room.  She didn't dare to turn around; she couldn't bear to see what Seven was thinking.  Feeling a little weak in the knees she braced her hands on the counter, and simply waited for whatever was going to happen.</p>

<p>Seven stood in the doorway to the kitchen; she could see the tension in B'Elanna's shoulders as she leaned on the sink, not turning around. She was torn between fear and hope, afraid to go to B'Elanna in case she had misread the moment between them in the bedroom.  She could not bear to be rejected now; they had come so close so many times and still they were apart.  B'Elanna's words came unbidden to her mind, <i>'The one thing I know for sure is that when things get tough emotionally we should run <b>to </b>the people we love, not run from them.'</i>  Now firm in her resolve Seven moved across the kitchen toward B'Elanna.</p>

<p>B'Elanna felt the heat from Seven's body close behind her, and then felt the beautiful young woman's arms encircle her waist, hands sliding beneath her shirt to find the burning flesh beneath.  She leaned back into the contact, allowing Seven to bear the responsibility for holding her up on her feet.  Not a word was spoken as they stood there, together at last.  When her legs were feeling strong enough, B'Elanna turned in the circle of Seven's arms, finally allowing herself to pull the younger woman into an embrace.  She leaned her forehead against Seven's for a moment, before leaning back to see what was in her eyes.  All she saw was love and tenderness, a mirror image of what she felt shining through her own eyes.</p>

<p>"Is this really happening?" B'Elanna whispered softy, afraid of breaking the spell.</p>

<p>"Kiss me B'Elanna," Seven breathed.</p>

<p>Finally their lips met, the faintest of pressure, the lightest of touches, but it was enough, and yet if it lasted a lifetime it would never be enough.</p>

<p>"I have loved you for so long B'Elanna, and I have longed for this moment, but I never dared hope until this morning."</p>

<p>"And I love you. So many times I tried to say it, but I was terrified that you wouldn't love me back, I was afraid of losing what we already have," B'Elanna murmured.</p>

<p>Once again their lips met, lightly at first and then quickly deeper, harder.  Tongues touched and withdrew, returning to begin a slow erotic dance of exploration together.</p>

<p>Feeling herself growing dizzy and out of control with the emotions flooding her cortical array Seven ended the kiss and allowed her full weight to sag into the strong arms of B'Elanna.  She was weak and shaking as tears began to track down her face.</p>

<p>"Seven," B'Elanna was alarmed at the young drone's reaction, "what's wrong, are you alright&#133;. Talk to me Seven, please."</p>

<p>"I believe that I am malfunctioning, I am feeling joy, and fear and other things that I am unable to identify. My cardiac muscle is contracting erratically and I believe I am sick to my stomach."</p>

<p>After all of her fear and hesitation B'Elanna was suddenly completely calm as she spoke to the distressed woman in her arms.  "You're functioning perfectly.  I'm feeling exactly the same way&#133;I think it must be love," she smiled.</p>

<p>"What should I do?"  The panic was evident in Seven's voice.</p>

<p>"Just breathe love, just breathe."</p>

<p>B'Elanna gently kissed the tears away from Seven's face, "Shhh, sweetheart, everything is going to be alright now, we're going to be just fine," she murmured.</p>

<p>Seven slowly began to calm down, drawing strength from B'Elanna's words and embrace.</p>

<p>"I have in my memory the assimilated knowledge of thousands of species, and yet in this moment I find I do not have any words to describe all that I am feeling," she finally managed.</p>

<p>"I know love, it's overwhelming.  I've never felt anything like this before either, but I know that if we just hold on to each other we'll figure it out&#151;together," B'Elanna reassured.</p>

<p>A noise from the living room reminded them both that they were not alone, and B'Elanna grinned sheepishly,  "C'mon, we'd better check on Kate before she dismantles the living room.</p>

<p>Seven felt bereft as B'Elanna hugged her fiercely and then moved away to retrieve her daughter, but she recognized that some things had to take precedence.</p>

<p>B'Elanna scooped up her daughter saying, "Alright Qu'Hom, lets get you ready for the day shall we?"</p>

<p>One they were all bathed and dressed they went back to the spot on the beach that they had occupied the day before.  They stretched out in the sand and Seven shyly asked,</p>

<p>"Do you thing that Tom will wish to spend time with Kate today?"</p>

<p>B'Elanna laughed, "I was just wondering the same thing. Why don't you watch her while I go see if I can find him."</p>

<p>She loped down the beach, enjoying the feeling of running in the fresh air, of burning off some of the nervous energy that had been building up in her since this morning.  She finally spotted Tom down the beach a little further, surrounded by a number of young women.  He was laughing and talking while Harry looked on enviously.</p>

<p>"Hey Tom can I talk to you for a minute?"</p>

<p>"I'm a little busy right now B'Elanna, can it wait?" he replied still staring at the beautiful Kintari woman he had been flirting with.</p>

<p>B'Elanna felt a surge of irritation, "Its about Kate."</p>

<p>"Is she alright?" Tom demanded, the Kintari female now forgotten.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I need a favour from you.  I was, ah, I was wondering if you could take her tonight and tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I can take her tomorrow, but I kind of have plans for tonight."</p>

<p>"Tom, you know I wouldn't ask if it weren't really important."</p>

<p>"I know Lanna, but my plans are pretty important as well." His leering look at his female companion told B'Elanna all she needed to know about his plans for this evening.  She knew there was no point in arguing so she simply made plans to have Tom pick Kate up at 0700 the next morning, as she and Dartak were to go climbing that day.</p>

<p>B'Elanna's face told Seven all she needed to know about whether or not they would have any time alone together today.  She was disappointed but was determined to cheer B'Elanna up, and so she suggested that they find Sam, Neelix and Naomi in the hopes that lively company would make the day pass more quickly.</p>

<p>They found their friends ensconced beneath the largest, most colourful umbrella on the beach; Naomi was happy to see her friends and soon they were all laughing and playing together.  B'Elanna was feeling much better when Sam offered to watch Kate if she and Seven wanted some time to themselves.  Not needing to be asked twice they jumped to their feet and took a walk down the beach.</p>

<p>As they walked Seven felt her knuckles graze B'Elanna's hand, she was surprised at how powerfully that simple touch affected her; she was gratified when she felt B'Elanna take her hand, intertwining their fingers as they walked.  They walked along the burning sand just enjoying the feeling of holding hands together.  They followed the curve of the beach far beyond the borders of the resort until they were out of sight of everyone on the beach.  In the near distance was a rather large rock formation and without a word they headed toward it.  Upon reaching the outcropping they stopped and melted into one another's arms.  Seven felt herself growing weak in the knees again, and was grateful when she felt B'Elanna lift her up onto a rock ledge, gently sitting her down and standing between her legs without once breaking their kiss.</p>

<p>B'Elanna allowed her hands to rest on Seven's legs, her thumbs gently stroking the soft skin of her inner thighs.  Seven moaned her pleasure at the touch.  When B'Elanna's hands slid up under her shirt to explore the skin Seven felt a moment of discomfort as the Klingon's hands encountered her abdominal implant, but the moment passed as she felt B'Elanna stroke the metal lovingly, evoking a myriad of pleasurable responses from her companion.  Seven brought her legs up and crossed them behind B'Elanna's back, pulling her closer.  She felt the young Klingon's fingers gently graze the sides of her breasts as the sensual exploration continued.</p>

<p>Seven massaged the prominent spinal ridges on B'Elanna's back, gratified to hear the moans of pleasure it elicited from the fiery young woman.  She allowed her hands to drift still lower to grasp the shapely behind of the young Klingon, kneading the firm flesh between her hands, reveling in the sensations it evoked when her actions caused B'Elanna's body to come into closer contact with her own.  She slowly drew her hands up B'Elanna's sides until they reached the firm swell of the Klingon's breasts. She stopped here, brushing her knuckles gently along the sides of the sensuous globes, coming close to but never touching the achingly erect nipples of the young woman's beautiful breasts.  She kept up her gentle torture until B'Elanna broke their kiss; panting for breath she growled,</p>

<p>"Kahless I want you Seven."</p>

<p>"And you shall have me," Seven replied in a demure voice that belied the raging passion she was feeling.</p>

<p>"We should head back or I'm going to take you right here on the beach," B'Elanna groaned.</p>

<p>"Would that be so bad?"</p>

<p>"I'm not having our first time be some roll in the sand, worried that we're going to get caught by a tourist out for a stroll Seven. When we make love for the first time we aren't going to rush, or think about anything but one another and what we're doing."</p>

<p>"Very well, then I believe your idea to return is a sound one, if we continue this activity any longer I am not convinced that I will be able to stop myself from making love to you."</p>

<p>B'Elanna's heart leapt at the idea that Seven was having as hard a time as she with not making love.  She always thought that the Klingon side of her made her more headstrong in that area.  It was thrilling to know that she was finally with someone who returned her unbridled passion in kind.  It was going to be hard to wait, but she knew it was going to be worth it.</p>

<p>They returned to Sam and Neelix, still holding hands and giggling like schoolgirls.  Their bruised lips and giddy manner was more than enough to tell their friends that the nature of their relationship had changed irrevocably.  Although they had plans for this evening, Sam and Neelix offered to take Kate overnight tomorrow, and their offer was gratefully accepted.  To Seven and B'Elanna's immense relief they agreed to pick Kate up from Tom's at dinnertime the next day.</p>

<p>When it was time for Neelix and Sam to leave for their evening B'Elanna and Seven found themselves wondering how in the world they would get through the rest of the day without losing their minds.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that maybe we could wander around a bit and see who we can scare up to have dinner with us tonight," B'Elanna suggested.</p>

<p>"You do not wish to spend the evening alone with me?" Seven pouted.</p>

<p>"You know I do, but I don't want us to be together for the first time with Kate asleep in the next room.  I want to wait until tomorrow when we'll have the whole house to ourselves. I just thought it might be nice to have some friends over; I guess I also think it might be nice to let our friends in on our happiness."</p>

<p>"You wish to inform them of the change in the status of our relationship?"</p>

<p>"Well, yeah, I guess I want everyone to know we're in love, why, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I am happy to be open about our relationship, I just wasn't sure that you would be.  I know that many of the crew are uncomfortable around me because I am Borg, and I would not like to see your reputation suffer as a result of your involvement with me."  Seven looked very sad as she spoke.</p>

<p>B'Elanna took the younger woman in her arms, "Look at me Seven.  I love you and I don't care who knows it.  If people have a problem with you then they have a problem with me too, but I really don't think that many people are going to have a problem with us.  Give people a chance to get to know you, they'll love you just like I do."</p>

<p>"If you say so B'Elanna," Seven remained skeptical.</p>

<p>They gathered up their things and wandered down the beach; in the end they found the Captain, Chakotay and Harry Kim all without plans for the evening and quickly invited them all for dinner.  Seven was concerned about Chakotay's reaction to the news of their relationship. She was still uncomfortable around him after he objected to the removal of the cortical inhibitor, but she knew that he was important to B'Elanna and so tried to keep an open mind about getting to know him better.</p>

<p>The evening turned out to be a great success.  Everyone was happy to hear about the change in their relationship, even Chakotay only hesitated a moment before proposing a toast to the happy couple.  He had had his doubts about Seven in the past, but it was obvious to anyone with eyes that B'Elanna had never been happier in her life, and he cared too much for her to do anything to mar that happiness.</p>

<p>When everyone had left and Kate was asleep they got ready for bed, each still changing in the bathroom before entering the bedroom.  B'Elanna was the first one under the covers and she lay there waiting for Seven to reenter the room.  She knew it was going to be nearly impossible to keep her hands off the beautiful young Borg, but she was determined to do her best.  When Seven entered the room B'Elanna's breath caught in her throat.  Even though the younger woman was only wearing boxer shorts and a tee shirt she was stunningly beautiful with her hair cascading around her shoulders.  She crawled under the sheets and immediately sought out the warmth of B'Elanna's body.  They snuggled together in one another's arms.  Seven lay her head on B'Elanna's shoulder, enjoying the sounds of her hearts beating and her breathing.  B'Elanna kissed her forehead and gently stroked her back through the fabric of her shirt.  Seven loved the ticklish feeling of the young Klingon's fingers dancing up and down her spine, and she was content to lie still and enjoy this feeling of connection with her soon-to-be lover.  Eventually they both fell asleep tangled together in their loving embrace.</p>

<p>Seven o'clock came early the next day, and Tom's knock at the door brought them both awake.  The young helmsman looked sleepy, but he was in a good mood as he regaled B'Elanna with his tales of amorous success from the previous evening.  As he left with his daughter in his arms B'Elanna saw Dartak coming up the walkway to the house.  She smiled broadly at the sight of the older man's powerful frame, and even though she would have liked to spend the entire day alone with Seven she was happy to be going climbing with her friend.</p>

<p>Seven was joining them for the day as Dartak assured her that there were several climbs that a beginner could enjoy.  She was looking forward to spending the day with the older man as well, and she quickly helped pack up food and equipment for their adventure.  Dartak had arranged transport to and from the trailhead, but there was still a long hilly hike ahead of them before they reached the rock face they were going to be climbing on.</p>

<p>The hike was challenging but they were all in good shape and the fresh air was invigorating.  They all felt as if they had more energy not less by the time they reached the wall.  Seven watched as Dartak and B'Elanna laid out the necessary equipment.  Some of the climbs were well marked and had top ropes already attached.  These were the beginners' climbs and they would warm up here first while Seven learned how to use the equipment and mastered the basic moves of the art.  She would watch in the afternoon as the two more experienced climbers attempted the tougher lead climbs of the southern face.</p>

<p>Once they began, Seven found that she loved the feeling of climbing high on the rock.  She began to understand that it was more than a sport, there was an art to finding the right hand holds, and balancing your body perfectly as you planned your next move.  She was surprised to find how difficult it could be to ensure that you ended up with the proper foot or hand on the proper hold in order to make your next move.  The analytical part of her mind was getting a workout as she began to learn how to read the rock, and plan her routes to the top.</p>

<p>Dartak and B'Elanna were as different as day and night on the wall.  Dartak was all muscle and bull strength; he literally pulled his way up the wall.  B'Elanna however moved like a dancer, her lithe frame was always perfectly balanced and she appeared to be moving effortlessly as she climbed.  B'Elanna was wearing only a cropped tank top and very tight shorts and Seven could see every muscle and sinew work as she climbed, it was often an effort to drag her eyes away from the awesome display of power and pay attention to her own surroundings.</p>

<p>At lunch they ate ravenously, and prepared for the afternoon's climb.  Seven was not going to be joining them on the wall, but she had brought a holoimager with her and was anxious to capture the scenery around her, as well as some images of the two climbers on the rock.  Lead climbing was much more dangerous than the top roped climbs and Seven knew she was not ready for such an undertaking yet.</p>

<p>Once they were loaded with their equipment Dartak led the first pitch of the climb.  He had an uncanny ability to find nooks and crannies to insert gear and they moved very quickly upwards.  B'Elanna followed, removing the gear as she passed, her ascent much quicker than Dartak's as she needn't bother to map the route.  Once she reached the ledge they switched leads and B'Elanna led the second pitch to the top.  Seven managed to capture several breathtaking images as they worked.</p>

<p>When they reached the top they both sat down to catch their breath and enjoy the scenery.  Dartak was exhausted but completely happy.</p>

<p>"So I see that you and Seven have finally managed to get over your fears little one," he teased B'Elanna.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it took a while, but I think we've finally seen the light."</p>

<p>"I was a little worried you might panic and leave when you realized your vacation house had shrunk a little," he grinned broadly as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Shrunk, what are you&#133;. How did you know about that?"  B'Elanna cried.</p>

<p>"Well, I may have made a call to a certain resort owner&#133;" he allowed his voice to trail off.</p>

<p>"You didn't&#133;. You did &#133; You son of a Targ&#133;. You set us up!!!!"  B'Elanna shook her head in disbelief.</p>

<p>"Somebody needed to do something&#133;I've never met a more stubborn pair in my entire life," he shook his head at the memories of how hard he had tried to get the pair to realize their feelings when they were working on the station.  "If there's one thing I've learned in life its that life is short and time is precious, so I just decided to move things along a little quicker that's all."</p>

<p>"I can't decide whether to hug you or push you off this wall old man," B'Elanna teased.</p>

<p>"Well, if you push me you'll have a hard time getting down there yourself, so you might want to bear that in mind," he laughed.  "Oh, and by the way&#133;. jachchoHmeH 'lwraj penaghtaH B'Elanna."</p>

<p>"How is it possible that a Kintari engineer from the Delta Quadrant could possible know the Klingon for THAT?" B'Elanna was blushing furiously at the Klingon admonition to 'mate until your blood screams.'</p>

<p>"I had a little help from a certain hairy ambassador.  He did the research for me before you people left the station."</p>

<p>B'Elanna could only shake her head as they prepared for the descent.</p>

<p>When they reached the floor they packed up the gear and prepared to leave.  Dartak told B'Elanna about a small free climb he attempted whenever he came up here and asked if they would mind waiting while he tried.  They agreed and followed him to a short climb up and over a rather prominent overhang.  He made his way up about 3 meters until he was below the ledge.  They watched his muscles strain as he fought to find a handhold that would allow him to lever his body up and over the ledge.  He cast about in several directions, but the elusive holds always seemed just out of reach.  Finally he gave up and let himself drop back to the ground.</p>

<p>"May I?" B'Elanna inquired.</p>

<p>"Be my guest," he gasped.</p>

<p>B'Elanna swung up onto the wall, climbing with ease to the spot where Dartak had failed in his attempt.  She attempted several different ways of getting up to the ledge, but it looked as if she was going to suffer the same fate as the older man.  She rested for a moment, shaking out first one arm then the other, reapplying the chalk to her hands.  Seven held her breath as she watched B'Elanna grip the rock anew, allowing her body to stretch out to arms length. She then drew herself up almost as if she were doing a chin up; she gathered herself, muscles bunching in the effort, swung down and then launched herself up into the air.  For a moment she seemed to hang weightless in space and then her arms snaked out to grasp the top of the ledge.  With catlike grace she swung her feet into the wall, avoiding smashing her body into the rock, in a few quick moves she was over the ledge and on top of the wall.  She appeared to be a force of nature in those moments, absolutely powerful and utterly unstoppable.  It was a moment before Seven remembered to breathe.</p>

<p>When B'Elanna was once again on the ground beside her Seven gathered her into her arms, kissing her deeply.  She reveled in holding that power close; every fibre of her being was in love, in that moment she knew what it was to lust.</p>

<p>They made their way back down to the trailhead where the transport was waiting to return them to the resort.  As they hiked B'Elanna teased Dartak mercilessly about having flashed his favourite climb.  He gave as good as he got however, teasing her about how long it took for her to admit her feelings for Seven.  As they walked B'Elanna revealed that Dartak and his sister Illiria had conspired together to ensure they ended up in a one-bedroom cabin.  Seven couldn't believe the kind old man was capable of such deception, but she was certainly glad that he had been.</p>

<p>When they reached the resort they invited Dartak for dinner, but he politely declined, saying he had already made plans to dine with his sister.  He sensed that what the two of them really wanted was to finally be alone, and he certainly wasn't going to be the one that stood in the way, not after all the work he'd done to get them together finally.  He just hoped that Illiria would be at home so they really could have dinner together.</p>

<p>B'Elanna and Seven held hands as they walked up the path to the house.  B'Elanna had her hand on the doorknob when Seven spun her around, pulling her into a passionate embrace.  They kissed hungrily for several minutes on the doorstep before they finally broke apart and entered the cabin together.</p>
