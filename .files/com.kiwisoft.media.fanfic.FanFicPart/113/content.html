<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 1: Realization-->

<P>Buffy felt dead inside. Standing in the hospital room where her best friend lay in a coma, she was hollow. She was numb. She knew she was breathing, but couldn’t feel the air circulating in her lungs. She knew her heart was beating, but to her, it was frozen in place.</P>
<P>"The doctor said it was head trauma. She can wake up at any time, but... the longer it lasts, the... less likely it is." Xander said, standing beside her.</P>
<P>She brushed back a few stray hairs that were out of place on her friend’s face. She could see how pale Willow was. Her mouth, usually smiling, showed no signs of doing that anytime soon.</P>
<P>"I never should've let her try to do that curse. Angel must've known." Buffy said.</P>
<P>And it was the truth. She should have never let her do it, but Willow would have protested until she gave in. Willow was always ready to help her, and this time she may have cost herself her life.</p>
<P>Buffy didn’t care about Angel, Acathla, the murder charges, any of that. It just didn’t matter. At this moment, all that mattered was Willow. It put everything into perspective for Buffy. A perspective she was just beginning to understand. She knew that if she lost Willow, whether she ever got Angel back again or not, she couldn’t keep going.</P>
<P>"Where are her parents?" Buffy asked.</p>
<P>"With relatives in Phoenix. I gave them a call. They're... they're getting on a plane back."</p>
<P>"Does Oz know?"</p>
<P>"Oh, man...I didn't even think...I'll call him."</p>
<P>Hearing footsteps, they both reluctantly turned away to see who was coming. Cordelia slowly came in, and her gaze immediately traveled down to Willow’s still form.</P>
<p>"Hey." Xander said softly, hugging her.</p>
<p>"Hey." She responded just as softly. "How is she? The doctor told me that..."</p>
<P>"Yeah. We're, uh...still waiting."</P>
<P>They both looked at Buffy who was not paying any attention to their conversation. Her eyes were locked onto her friend’s face. Realizing how quiet she was, she broke away, and looked up at Cordelia.</P>
<P>"You okay?" Buffy asked finally.</p>
<P>"I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I realized nobody was chasing me. Not too brave."</p>
<P>"It was the right thing to do."</p>
<P><I>‘If I had been as sensible as Cordelia, I might have stopped...’ </I>Buffy started thinking to herself.</P>
<P>She should have known the whole thing was a set up from the get go. It wasn’t like Angel to challenge her out in the open. He would never request a fight. It lacked style. She should have known something was up.</P>
<P>"Did -" Xander started to say, as Buffy cut him off.</P>
<P>"Could you guys...give me a few minutes?"</P>
<P>Any objections they had to her request were washed a way as soon as they looked at her expression. It was one of pleading need.</P>
<P>"We’ll be right outside." Cordelia said, ushering Xander out the room before he could say anything.</P>
<P>Buffy heard the door shut, and sat down on empty space on the bed. Sighing out of weariness, she finally let the tears come. Sobbing, she laid her head down on Willow’s chest, and put her friend’s hand in hers.</P>
<P>Now that she was alone, technically, she allowed herself to think about Willow. She felt like she was on the verge of clarity. Something she should have allowed herself to realize a long time ago, but never did.</P>
<P>Willow was a unique individual. And that was putting it mildly. She was so brilliant, intelligent, resourceful. But that was just scratching the surface. On the outside, she seemed fragile, unsure. But inside, she was a confident, incredibly strong, person. Stronger than Buffy herself in a lot of ways.</P>
<P>Despite everything Buffy had put her through, she still managed to cling onto that innocence Buffy had lost a long time ago. But it wasn’t an innocence that a child possessed. A child’s innocence was one of complete and blissful ignorance, where the events of the world didn’t matter, and didn’t affect you in any way. There was still that wonder of new surroundings, and nothing could hurt you.</P>
<P>No that was not Willow’s innocence, for she had seen many horrible things, more than anybody should have to see at the age of seventeen. Her innocence, well, Buffy couldn’t find a word for it. It had elements of a child’s, yet it also had a great deal of maturity. Whatever it was, it allowed Willow to always look at the bright side of life.</P>
<P>Buffy wanted that innocence. She craved it. Innocence or no, it was still beyond her how after narrowly escaping death, Willow could have a smile on her face the next day. And the smile wasn’t put there for anyone’s benefit either. It was a true, honest to goodness, smile. She could never stay mad at anyone, would never intentionally hurt anyone, and was loyal to the end.</P>
<P>The more Buffy thought about it, the more she understood. Willow was her innocence. She was the one who filled the empty hole in Buffy’s soul, she was the one who comforted Buffy, the one who reminded her what a life was like, and why it was important to hold on to it.</P>
<P>As hard as it was to admit to herself, no one else did that. Not Giles, not her mom, and not...Angel. Everyone else tried to protect her, guide her in what they assumed was the right direction. Giles still didn’t agree with her actions as a slayer. Her mom tried desperately to keep her cooped up away from the big bad world that she didn’t even understand herself. And Angel, even as much as he had loved her, still had tried to shield himself from her, thinking she couldn’t handle him and his past.</P>
<P>Even Xander had his opinions on the way she did things, trying to force her to do the right thing. Well, the right thing in his mind. It showed her that they cared, and it meant a lot to her, but they didn’t trust her. Not completely anyway. And right now, it would be hard to argue that point considering what she had done. But Willow had never questioned her, never judged her, and never got on her case if something went wrong.</P>
<P>Miss Calendar was a prime example. Ever since her death, Xander had been on a ‘Die, Angel, Die’ crusade. It seemed to everyone else that he focused all blame solely on Angel, but Buffy could see it in his eyes. He blamed her too. Giles eyes told her the same thing. They may have not said it out loud, but she knew. Every time they looked at her now, she felt like she was being drilled into. She felt uncomfortable, and sometimes, even hated. And to her, the looks were worse than the actual words.</P>
<P>And considering that she already placed all the blame on herself, she couldn’t handle anymore from them. Willow hadn’t blamed her. She had comforted her, and her eyes only held a look of understanding and sympathy. Buffy felt safe around Willow. She felt completed. She felt unconditional trust, friendship, and...</P>
<P><I>‘Oh my God...’ </I>Buffy thought.</P>
<P>The clarity hit her. She finally understood. She took her head off of Willow’s chest, and looked at her face.</P>
<I><P>‘I love Willow...’</P>
</I><P>That realization comforted her as well as scared her. Had she loved her all this time? If she had, that meant Buffy risked her life for nothing. That meant her love for Angel wasn’t as strong as she thought it was. If that was true, then what was Angel? What if Willow didn’t? What if... The more she mulled over her new understanding, the more confused she got.</P>
<P>She moved her face up to Willow’s, and kissed her friend’s lips softly. She had to say it before she second-guessed herself. Before she questioned her instincts, her feelings.</P>
<P>"I love you, Will."</P>
<P>By the door, Cordelia listened quietly. Xander started to go in.</P>
<P>"Don’t, Xander."</P>
<P>"Don’t? But I -"</P>
<P>"Just don’t."</P>
<P>By the bed, Buffy had drifted off to sleep.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>When she awoke, she wasn’t in the hospital anymore. Looking at her surroundings, she saw that she was in Angel’s old apartment. On his bed. The place that started her life on a downward spiral that just seemed to keep going.</P>
<p><I>‘How did I get here?’ </I>She questioned herself.</P>
<p>Then she got it.</P>
<p><I>‘Dream.’</I></P>
<p>"Have a nice nap?" said an all too familiar voice.</P>
<p>Buffy looked at the entryway that led into the bedroom. Willow walked in. She wasn’t wearing a hospital gown; she was wearing a pink sweater with a large yellow daisy on the front, and light red skirt.</P>
<p>"Willow? Are you here?"</P>
<p>"I don’t know really. Do you think I am?"</P>
<p>"If it is really you, then are you...dead?"</P>
<p>Buffy prayed to whatever might have been listening for that not to be true.</P>
<p>"Well, I’m not carrying a harp. Does that answer your question?"</P>
<p>"But you’re Jewish. Do you even have harps in the afterlife?"</P>
<p>"Okay, a draydle then. Either way, I am still of the living. Well sorta."</P>
<p>"What do you mean?"</P>
<p>"Well I’m still in the coma. So I’m in between."</P>
<p>Buffy’s sadness and guilt showed clearly on her face.</P>
<p>"And it’s not your fault. I knew the risks. Besides I’m gonna make it. Soon."</P>
<p>Buffy felt some hope rise within her, as Willow came to sit down next to her on the bed.</P>
<p>"I’m confused." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"I know."</P>
<p>"I meant it though."</P>
<p>"You really love me?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Yeah. I do."</P>
<p>"Then why are we here?"</p>
<p>"You don’t know?"</P>
<p>"Hey, this is your dream."</P>
<p>"I guess...this is automatically what I think of when I want to escape from my life. Despite what happened here."</P>
<p>"This place has good memories too."</P>
<p>"But does this mean I’ll never let go of Angel? I don’t want to hurt you."</P>
<p>"You’ll never let go of Angel. He’ll always be special to you. Like Xander is to me. Oz too."</P>
<p>"So Angel was just a first love thing? It seemed so much more then that..."</P>
<p>"Only you know what Angel was to you. Xander was a crush, a love that never got a chance to take off for me, and Oz is nice, but something still feels missing when I’m with him."</P>
<p>"Do you love me?"</P>
<p>"I’m not sure. My head’s kinda messy right now. That’s a pretty loaded question."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled in understanding.</P>
<P>"Too bad I’ll never have a chance to find out."</P>
<p>"What do you mean?"</P>
<p>"Well, I probably won’t remember any of this when I wake up, plus I know what you’re thinking of doing if you survive and stop Angel."</P>
<p><I>‘I’m going to leave...’</I></P>
<p>"It’s pretty unfair to me, to us, to say something as strong as I love you and then split. If I mean as much to you as you say I do..."</P>
<p>"You know I mean it. But what other choice do I have? All I end up doing is hurting you...hurting everybody."</P>
<p>"That’s not true, and you know it."</P>
<p>Around Buffy, everything was fading. She was waking up.</P>
<p>"Guess you gotta go, huh?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Guess so." Buffy said sadly.</P>
<p>"Will you be there when I come to?"</P>
<p>Before Buffy could answer, the dream world was gone, and she was staring at Xander.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<hr width=100>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<p>"How long was I out?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Five minutes."</P>
<p><I>‘Only five minutes?’</I></P>
<p>She saw the worried look in his eyes, and she immediately snapped to full attention mode.</P>
<p>"Xand? What is it?"</P>
<p>"I was talking with Cordy..."</P>
<p>"And?"</P>
<p>"She said Giles never followed her out. He hasn’t been here. We don’t -"</P>
<p>With a quick glance to check and make sure Willow was still in the bed and wasn’t going anywhere, Buffy shot up, and ran out the door.</P>

<hr width=100>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<p>Well, it was over. She had done her duty. She sent him to hell to save the world. Now she stood under a tree across the street from the school. The whole gang was there, probably talking about where she was. She saw Willow in the wheelchair. That was the clincher for her to make her decision.</P>
<p><I>‘She’s sitting in that because of me.’</I></P>
<p>She had wanted to stay. After the dream she had changed her mind, and told herself she wasn’t going to leave. But then things got worse. On top of Kendra’s death, her being a fugitive, and her friends’ injuries, she was also expelled, her mom practically threw her out of the house, Giles had been tortured, and she sent Angel, soul and all, to Hell.</P>
<p>Could anyone really blame her for leaving?</P>
<p>"Where you going?" A voice asked.</P>
<p>She glanced over to her side. Angel was standing there, a surreal light illuminating him. She thought it was odd, not only that he was here, but also that she didn’t have more of a reaction. Her thoughts were elsewhere, however.</P>
<p>"Away," she finally answered, "where I can’t hurt anybody. I’m sorry."</P>
<p>"Don’t be. You did what you had to do."</P>
<p>"But you’re -"</P>
<p>"I was saved. I’m," he looked up toward the sky, "up there now."</P>
<p>"Good. You deserve to be."</P>
<p>"You really think you’ll stop hurting them if you leave? There’ll still be vampires."</P>
<p>"They wouldn’t put themselves in danger."</P>
<p>"You know that isn’t true. You know they feel just as much responsibility to fight as you do. You’ll hurt them more."</P>
<p>Buffy was silent.</P>
<p>"Look at her." Angel said, pointing to Willow.</P>
<p>Willow was looking left and right searching for any sign of her. There was uncertainty in her expression. There was sadness.</P>
<p>"She cares so much for you. I guarantee you’ll hurt her a lot."</P>
<p>"She’ll be better off." Buffy said, unsure.</P>
<p>"You know that thing you love about her? The innocence? The happiness?"</P>
<p>"It’ll still be there."</P>
<p>"Maybe. But it’ll take some serious damage. She won’t be the same."</P>
<p>Buffy didn’t want to be the one to damage Willow’s personality.</P>
<p>"She does love you. She just doesn’t realize how much yet."</P>
<p>"But what about -"</P>
<p>"What we had? Just because you love her doesn’t lessen what we were."</P>
<p>"How do you know?"</P>
<p>"Buffy, I loved you. I will always love you."</P>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p>"We were first loves. Yes even though I lived for three centuries, you were my first love. I never truly loved anybody until I met you. But in the long run, it wouldn’t have survived. Not to say we probably wouldn’t have tried to make it work.</P>
<p>"You’re going to age, I wouldn’t have. We wouldn’t have been able to spend days together, wake up next to each other. Maybe in another life time things will be different, but for now..."</P>
<p>"Willow huh?"</P>
<p>"You’re happier when you’re around her. You know that. Truly happy, and that’s all I ever wanted for you. I fulfilled my destiny. I saved the world. Meeting you and loving you along the way was a bonus I didn’t deserve, but I’m glad I got the chance.</P>
<p>"Don’t throw away your chance at happiness. And don’t worry about hurting Willow. She’s tougher then she looks."</P>
<p>"Don’t I know it." Buffy smiled.</P>
<p>Angel vanished.</P>
<p>"Good bye, Angel." She said quietly.</P>
<p>She looked across the street. The gang was starting to head into school. With a deep breath, she ran across the street.</P>
<p>"Hey guys! Wait up." She called.</P>
<p>They  all turned around, and Willow had a smile and look of relief on her face.</P>
<p>"Told you." Willow said to Xander. "How’s..."</P>
<p>"Gone. But...happy." Buffy smiled at Willow. "Thank you."</P>
<p>"It was nothing."</P>
<p>"Giles, there was this tiny problem of me being expelled."</P>
<p>"I’ll take care of it."</P>
<p>Buffy didn’t want to ask him to elaborate on that. She saw Oz pushing Willow.</P>
<p>"Do you mind if I take over?" Buffy asked him.</P>
<p>"Nope. Go right ahead."</P>
<p>Buffy got behind the chair and started to push.</P>
<p>"Want me to go real fast?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>When they were far enough away from the rest of the gang, Willow looked up at Buffy.</P>
<p>"I don’t know how or why, but I remember it."</P>
<p>"The dream ‘it’?"</P>
<p>"Yes, that ‘it’."</P>
<p>Buffy held her breath waiting for the answer.</P>
<p>"And I do."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled down at her, and held her hand. The rest of the gang came running up.</P>
<p>"What is it with you gals and needing to go fast while injured?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>"I don’t know, Xand." Buffy responded.</P>
<p>"We must be two of a kind." Willow said.</P>
<p>With that, they entered the school.</P>
