<P>"What the hell happened to the life-sign?" Janeway cursed loudly at her
console.</P>
<P>It just disappeared. The life sign was there, then gone. Smashing her fist
against the console the Captain tried to hit it into compliance. </P>
<P>"Bring back the life-sign damn it!" </P>
<P>Her body on the verge of collapse from the hot carbon dioxide filled air,
Janeway fought hard against leaning back in her chair. The ship should have been
close enough to land minutes ago, but here she was still several kilometers away
from the surface. It was like the surface of the planet kept shrinking away
every time she got close. </P>
<P>Sweat poured into Janeway's eyes, frustrating the Captain even more than her
slippery fingers on the console.</P>
<P>In her gray tank-top, the Captain continued working over the console, trying
anything to get the life sign back. But the sensors were now offline and were
determined to stay that way.</P>
<P>The air tightened in her lungs, her eyes blurred with exhaustion, and her
arms felt like falling off. Janeway's resolve fell away as she gave into the
dying air and almost welcomed darkness. The computer's voice continually asked
the prone Captain if it should switch to auto-pilot, but an answer never came.
</P>

<P>The lush botanical gardens flourished with the help of one woman. The garden
had plant species from both the alpha and delta quadrants, and some that were so
alien they seemed not of this dimension. To a non-botanist, the gardens would
have taken their breath away, but to a true lover of plants, this garden was
heaven.</P>
<P>Parker walked from plant to plant, watering the ones that needed watering,
and leaving the ones that didn't need any. It was as if Parker knew exactly what
each plant needed, even if she had never seen it before. In fact, most of the
plants Parker was surrounded by were new to her. </P>
<P>The shear number of plant species overwhelmed the young ensign. Parker had
dreamt of studying a place like this all her life, with plants of all shapes and
colors. Now she was living her dream, but for some reason it didn't feel right.
</P>
<P>Maybe it was the feeling that Kes wasn't around to see this. She had always
admired her mentor, more than most people knew. But she knew that wasn't it.
Parker wasn't sure how long she had been here, or how she had gotten here for
that matter. A small part of her kept asking the same questions over and over.
Where was Voyager? Why was she alone?</P>
<P>The questions came, but every time she tried to put her mind to answering
them, a new plant would catch her eye. And she would study it at length,
admiring its curves, its colors, and its uniqueness. The thoughts of loneliness
would disappear and she would completely forget about Voyager.</P>
<P>That was until she heard a loud crash at the perimeter of the gardens. Parker
jumped from her kneeling position and dropped the flower that was in her hand.
Startled, Parker didn't move for a couple seconds, trying to figure out just
what could have made that horrible noise, she stood still trying not to fall
into her usual lull of admiring her garden. </P>
<P>Finally, Parker got the courage to investigate the loud noise and she headed
out in the direction that she thought it had come from. But just before moving
on, Parker grabbed a javelin like branch from one the of larger plants in her
garden and held it tightly in her hand.</P>

<P>B'Elanna almost fell in shock and surprise when she reached the entrance of
the cave, but managed to keep the sandwiches and towel safely tucked inside the
basket.</P>
<P>"Seven… What… How… "</P>
<P>B'Elanna's jaw dropped, taking in the site of Seven standing there, slightly
limping and holding her arm. Her bio-suit still laid on the ground.</P>
<P>"I don't recall what happened." Seven answered, stepping closer to B'Elanna
while shivering.</P>
<P>Seeing Seven shiver was all B'Elanna needed to put down the basket, taking
only the clean white towel inside and wrapping it around Seven's wet body.
B'Elanna buried her head into Seven's neck, glad that she was able to move and
talk again. Another sudden unexplained change. Things were getting weirder by
the minute.</P>
<P>Seven opened her mouth to talk, but B'Elanna softly ssshhhed her. </P>
<P>"Don't talk Seven, save your energy."</P>
<P>B'Elanna put a finger against Seven's lips, silencing the Borg. A gentle kiss
said all that was needed.</P>
<P>Reveling in the warm kiss, B'Elanna almost forgot about the food. That was
something she was going to have to explain along with the towel, which B'Elanna
was sure Seven was more than curious about. And knowing Borg logic, that wasn't
going to be easy, especially since B'Elanna didn't believe it herself.</P>
<P>Reluctantly B'Elanna pulled away. Her eyes staring deeply into Seven's,
B'Elanna's whole body and mind knew everything was going to be okay as long as
they were together.</P>
<P>"I love you," B'Elanna said intently without reservation. Her heart and soul
warmed at the reaction in Seven's eyes. </P>
<P>"I love you too," Seven responded happily, overwhelmed with joy. Tears flowed
freely from both women. Eternity gripped B'Elanna and Seven in a kiss, and they
knew timelessness, love, what it meant to be loved, and everything else that
made a person feel good inside. </P>
<P>The knowledge that they couldn't live without one another was both
frightening and wonderful at the same time. They had only been together for a
couple days, but for some reason it felt a lot longer. Maybe the days were
longer on this planet, or maybe it was B'Elanna's imagination, but the sun
seemed to stay up in the sky an awfully long time.</P>
<P>Lost in B'Elanna's embrace, Seven forgot about the mysterious white towel and
basket her lover had brought out of the cave. Only when the moment ended did
Seven realize the strangeness of the situation.</P>
<P>Lifting an eyebrow and staring down at the towel wrapped around her body,
Seven queried B'Elanna with a facial expression rather than with words.</P>
<P>"I knew you were gonna ask, but believe me, you won't believe a word I say,"
B'Elanna said with a winning smile.</P>
