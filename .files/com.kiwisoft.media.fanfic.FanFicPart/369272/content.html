<p>I know a lot of you are very upset with me for making Lilly such a twit, but hopefully this chapter will set her right in all your eyes. Sadly, there is only one more chapter left after this, but for now, enjoy ;)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter 16</b></p>
<p>Lilly jumped off her skateboard, jogging the last few steps to the diner. A quick glance at the sky told her a storm was rolling in, weather to fit her mood. She was more nervous than she had ever been, but knew she could not put this off any longer. Miley did not deserve the continued silence. Lilly just hoped it wasn't too late, though Miley had always been excessively good-hearted and forgiving so she knew she might stand a chance. She tried to catch her breath and straighten out her clothes before entering the diner; she'd practically skated over in record time.</p>
<p>It was the second Wednesday of the month, which meant Miley would be forced to spend her day at the diner while Grandma Ruby went to the market in Murfreesboro. Lilly entered, almost cautiously, eyes immediately drawn to the booth in the back Miley normally sat at. It was empty. Lilly frowned, turning towards the bar, but other than the regular crew of old men, there was no one. She considered briefly whether Miley was avoiding her, but disregarded the thought immediately – Miley would not do that.</p>
<p>Lilly stepped up to the bar and perched on the edge of one of the stools, just waiting. There was no employee around and she shifted anxiously. She'd been so ready to face Miley, to deal with what a shitty girlfriend she had been, and now she was left in limbo. Susan suddenly appeared from the back, glanced briefly at Lilly, and ignored her. Lilly watched her bustling around with some ketchup containers, wondering if she was ever going to be acknowledged. Several minutes passed until Susan turned, sighing as if she'd realized Lilly was not going to go away.</p>
<p>The woman's eyes were red-rimmed and slightly swollen and Lilly tried not to gape in shock. Something was wrong and anxiety took a hold over her once again. "How can I help you, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Susan's words were polite, but her voice was anything but. Lilly wondered if Miley had told her mother she was not answering her calls. It was very likely; Miley told her mother almost everything.</p>
<p>"I uh…is Miley here?"</p>
<p>"No. Now unless you're going to order something I'll have to ask you to leave."</p>
<p>Lilly dug in her pocket, coming up with a few crumpled bills and some coins, and threw them on the bar. She ordered a Coke, much to Susan's obvious chagrin and waited for the woman to bring it to her. She could tell something was going on and wanted answers. Susan set the glass in front of her and moved to leave, but Lilly stopped her.</p>
<p>"Is Miley with Grandma Ruby? I thought she wasn't allowed to go to the market anymore after she spilled that truckload of walnuts on the street."</p>
<p>Susan frowned and began wiping down the counter, though her movements seemed half-hearted. After several moments she stopped, a look of defeat crossing her face. She looked at Lilly, "Grandma Ruby is in the hospital."</p>
<p>"W-what?"</p>
<p>Susan looked at her, almost suspiciously, "Miley said she called you."</p>
<p>Lilly tried not to let the immense guilt show on her face. Miley had called her a lot, but she had not listened to a single message. She shook her head, "Uh…I've been having some phone problems."</p>
<p>Susan didn't believe her, she could tell. "Right."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>Susan just shook her head, "She had a heart attack, two days ago. She's still in the hospital, but she is doing okay."</p>
<p>Lilly clenched her fist, now even angrier with herself. That call when she'd been at the library, had been Miley trying to tell her about her grandmother and she'd just ignored it. She'd ignored Miley and her pain. She rubbed a hand across her forehead, hoping again that it was not too late to save her relationship.</p>
<p>"So, is Miley with her at the hospital?" She'd drive out to Murfreesboro, or even Nashville, if she had to. She needed to make things right with Miley.</p>
<p>Susan clenched her jaw visibly and averted her eyes. "I don't know where she is. I haven't seen her in two days."</p>
<p>Dread pooled in Lilly's stomach and her hand shook as it reached for her glass. She stared at the woman, wondering whether she had even heard her correctly. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Susan met her eyes, anger flaring in them, "I mean, Miley is gone. I cannot find her anywhere."</p>
<p>"W-why would she leave?"</p>
<p>"People she loves keep leaving…she just can't handle it," said Susan, voice softer now as she thought about her daughter.</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed the lump in her throat. "But we haven't left…"</p>
<p>Susan looked at her, eyes intense, "Yeah."</p>
<p>She said nothing else and Lilly shook her head to clear it. She knew what she had to do and it was now more important than ever. She stood up abruptly, meeting Susan's eyes.</p>
<p>"I'll find her. I promise I will. I'm not gonna let her go."</p>
<p>Lilly's voice was full of determination, but Susan merely watched her go, not sure if she believed her.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Dark clouds were rolling in and Lilly heard the distant thunder. She knew she had to find Miley quickly, before something bad happened. She'd promised Susan she would find the girl, but in all honesty, she had no idea where to even start looking. It was a safe bet that the woman had searched all of Miley's regular haunts and every climbable tree on their property.</p>
<p>Lilly was walking through town, carrying her skateboard in her hand. Her mind was racing, trying to come up with possible places Miley might be hiding, but to no avail. The girl was just too much of a mystery for anyone to figure her out. Lilly sighed heavily and turned down Main Street. She glanced at the old, creepy tree that sat by City Hall and stopped when she saw the mass of people surrounding it. Her eyes followed their upturned gazes to see a figure moving in the highest branches of the tree.</p>
<p>Lilly's heart gave a jolt and she rushed towards the crowd. The first raindrops fell. She pushed through the people, towards the front, and stared up at the top. The crowd had gathered a good ways away, forming a half circle around the grassy area. Lilly's eyes scanned the tree with apprehension. It was tall, a good twenty feet, and almost entirely devoid of leaves. It looked dead and Lilly was almost reluctant to go near it.</p>
<p>All the way at the top, straddling one of the blackened branches, sat Miley, head turned towards the sky. Lilly had found her, but now she had no idea what to do with her. She moved towards the tree, but someone grabbed her arm and stopped her. She turned to look at Oliver, whose face was worried.</p>
<p>"Lilly, there's a storm coming. It's dangerous, especially near her."</p>
<p>She pulled her arm away, risking a quick glance at the sky. A raindrop landed in her eye. Lilly looked at Oliver, face grim, "I know. Do you think I'll just leave her up there to be struck?"</p>
<p>He looked unsure and Lilly knew it was exactly what everyone else had planned on doing. Even worse, they seemed to be waiting for it to happen. The thought made her angry and she turned, walking up to the tree. A murmur went through the crowd, but no one made a move to stop or help her. She looked up, the tree seeming so much taller from her current position.</p>
<p>"Miley!" yelled Lilly, as loud as she could. Strong gusts of wind were picking up, carrying her voice away.</p>
<p>Miley slowly looked down and even from the distance, Lilly could easily tell she'd been crying. Her face though, showed no emotion and it was so unlike how she remembered her girlfriend's face, Lilly's stomach dropped. Miley looked at her briefly, before staring straight ahead, not acknowledging the blonde.</p>
<p>"Miley, what are you doing up there? Come down!"</p>
<p>Still no acknowledgement. Miley turned her head to the sky again. Thunder sounded, closer now, and Lilly shuddered. Miley raised her arms, face turned upward. She was yelling, and even with the wind, Lilly could easily hear her words.</p>
<p>"I'm right here! Come and take me already!"</p>
<p>The words chilled Lilly to her bones and she glanced around for some sort of leverage. There was none. She looked up again, her worry intensifying. Miley's body was shaking with sobs.</p>
<p>"If you don't come down, I'm coming up there, Miley!"</p>
<p>Still no answer. Lilly turned, eyes scanning the crowd until she found Oliver and waved him over. He was reluctant, but joined her under the tree. He seemed more nervous than she was and that was saying something.</p>
<p>"Oliver, I need you to help me climb up that tree," said Lilly simply, looking at him expectantly.</p>
<p>Oliver glanced up the tree then back at her, looking unsure, "I don't know, Lilly…this is a bad idea."</p>
<p>Lilly glared at him, "I didn't ask for your opinion. Now will you help me?"</p>
<p>He seemed to hesitate, but eventually put his hands together for Lilly to step in. He practically lifted her to the first branch and, once she had climbed onto it, stepped away and moved back towards the safety of the crowd. Lilly reached for a second branch and swung herself onto it with minor difficulty.</p>
<p>She'd climbed plenty of trees in her time, but Lilly was nowhere near the tree climbing abilities of Miley and she worried she wouldn't make it to the top. She'd also developed a fear of heights that made this whole endeavor even more difficult. Lilly made slow progress and the higher she got, the more the gusts of wind threatened to blow her off the tree. Occasional raindrops still fell, but she was grateful it had not started raining in earnest. It thundered again, an ominous sound Lilly had come to hate. She continued her climb.</p>
<p>It probably took her a good fifteen minutes, but eventually she was just one branch away from her girlfriend. Miley had not moved or acknowledged her presence at all during that time and it worried her. Lilly risked a glance down, regretting it immediately. The crowd had only grown larger and she cursed the people for gathering to watch imminent disaster, yet no one had called for help. Lilly pulled herself up the last branch, very carefully, and ended up face to face with Miley, barely a foot apart.</p>
<p>Miley looked at her and though it was obvious she was trying to hold it all in, the tears nevertheless spilled from her eyes and her chin quivered. Her breath hitched with each sob and her shoulders shook. Lilly had never seen her like this and it scared her. She wrapped her fingers around Miley's wrist.</p>
<p>"Miley…Miles…please, just come down," begged Lilly, hoping she could get through.</p>
<p>Miley merely shook her head, sniffing. Lilly tried to shove the panic and frustration away, but it was getting harder. Here she was twenty feet in the air, perched on a dead tree branch, while a thunderstorm was coming their way.</p>
<p>"You're gonna get struck again, sitting up here…"</p>
<p>Miley looked up into the sky and despite the sobs, her voice sounded almost normal, "If it wants me so bad, it can have me."</p>
<p>"If what wants you?" Lilly was at a loss of what to do.</p>
<p>"The lightning. The gods. The demons. Whatever put this curse on me. It just keeps spitting me back out, but…it takes everyone else." Miley started crying again and Lilly slid a few inches closer, grasping both the girl's hands in hers.</p>
<p>"Miles, please listen to me…you're not cursed. And no one is being taken this time," said Lilly intently, forcing Miley to look at her.</p>
<p>Miley shook her head, squeezing her eyes shut, "It took my whole family…it made you stop loving me…why won't it just take <b>me</b>?"</p>
<p>Tears welled up in her own eyes and Lilly swallowed the lump in her throat. She moved her hands to Miley's upper arms, squeezing tightly enough to make the girl look at her.</p>
<p>"Miley, I never stopped loving you. I was a dumb, foolish, idiotic, horrible dumbass, but I always loved you. Sometimes when people love each other they do stupid things they regret and hopefully the other person can forgive them."</p>
<p>"My daddy and Jackson…you think they'll forgive me?" Miley sounded so broken and sincere when she asked her question, her head turned to the right to hide her face.</p>
<p>Lilly blinked, confused. "Why would they need to forgive you?"</p>
<p>Miley turned back to face Lilly, more tears spilling from her eyes, while her chin quivered pitifully.</p>
<p>"Miley…what…" Lilly was too shocked to form a coherent sentence and Miley looked down.</p>
<p>"They said there was lightning…it must've been coming for me…it wanted <b>me</b>." She was sobbing, heart-wrenching sounds that tore at Lilly's insides.</p>
<p>Lilly took Miley's wrists and pulled the girl's hands away from her face, leaning in so she had no choice but to look at her. "Miley, listen to me, that was <b>not</b> your fault. It was an accident and your dad and brother know that."</p>
<p>Miley shook her head almost forcefully, "They were taken and I'm still here."</p>
<p>"And everyone, me, your mom, your grandma, your dad and brother included, I'm sure, are so goddamn grateful for that. The people that love you couldn't stand it if you weren't here, Miley."</p>
<p>The fervor in her voice was enough to make the corner of Miley's mouth twitch slightly, but she looked away again. A gust of wind shook the tree, but they remained steady on the branch. Darker clouds rolled in, nearly blacking out the sun. Miley looked down at her hands.</p>
<p>"My grandma…"</p>
<p>"…is alive, Miles. She's in the hospital, but your mom said she was gonna be fine."</p>
<p>Miley looked at her, doubt in her eyes. She was clearly wondering whether Lilly would lie to her about this to get her out of the tree.</p>
<p>"She's really okay?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Miley, I would never lie to you about that."</p>
<p>Miley nodded and sighed heavily. She looked around them, before finally meeting Lilly's eyes again, "You thought I'm cursed, too."</p>
<p>It was Lilly's turn to sigh. "I was freaked out about my parents and what Michael was saying and it made me think some really stupid things. I know it's not your fault, Miley, none of it is."</p>
<p>Miley looked away from her, obviously not convinced. Lilly grabbed her hands again. "Maybe everyone just has it turned around. I mean, in all the time I've known you, nothing bad has ever happened to me. So, maybe you're really my good luck charm…"</p>
<p>Miley scoffed, still not meeting her eyes. Lilly slid as close as possible, until they were practically touching and reached over to cup Miley's cheeks with her hands. She knew there was a whole crowd of nosy townspeople watching, but she did not care. Lilly pulled Miley's face towards her own and pressed their lips together. She tasted tears and dirt and rain, but the feeling of pure joy she always felt kissing her girlfriend burned just as bright as ever. When she pulled away, Miley's blue eyes were gazing intently into her own.</p>
<p>"I love you, Miley, curse or no curse, no matter what."</p>
<p>Miley stared into her eyes and for that moment, it was just them. They weren't sitting in a tree, dangerously close to lightning and rain, with a crowd of crazy people watching them. It was just Miley and Lilly, together. Miley finally smiled and though it was nowhere near as overwhelming as her smiles normally were, Lilly felt a huge weight lift off her chest.</p>
<p>"I love you, too."</p>
<p>Lilly sighed in relief, looking around at their predicament. Raindrops were falling more steadily now, but still not consistently enough to be a problem. Dark grey clouds dipped the area into an eerie light, while the wind rustled the leaves on nearby trees and pulled at their clothes. Thunder boomed, close enough now they could feel it shaking the ground. It was definitely time to get out of there.</p>
<p>"Can we go down now?" asked Lilly, hopeful.</p>
<p>Miley nodded curtly, pushing herself back completely against the trunk and reaching for a branch on the side. Lilly moved past her to grab the branch and slowly maneuvered herself onto the one below. She really hoped it wouldn't take her as long to get down as it had getting up. The dead branch creaked under her weight and she glanced up at her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"What's with this tree, anyway?"</p>
<p>Miley moved sideways on her branch to follow the blonde, "It's the Lightning Tree."</p>
<p>"The what?"</p>
<p>"The Lightning Tree. It's been struck as many times as me…and it's still standing. It's quite a miracle, which is probably why they haven't torn it down, yet," said Miley with a shrug, waiting for Lilly to move so she could climb down.</p>
<p>Lilly gave her a weird look, "You're still standing, too, Miles."</p>
<p>Miley grinned, "They haven't torn me down, either." She bounced slightly on her branch, anxious now, "Come on, let's go down."</p>
<p>Lilly was just about to make a comment about whose fault it was in the first place they were even up there, when Miley stiffened so significantly it was hard to miss. Lilly looked up at her girlfriend, wondering what was wrong, but Miley's face was once again turned to the sky. When she looked back at Lilly, she was deathly pale.</p>
<p>"Lilly, you gotta hurry…you gotta get off this tree." Her voice shook with panic.</p>
<p>"Miley, what's wrong?" asked Lilly, not sure what had happened. Miley had seemed okay just a few seconds ago.</p>
<p>Miley scrambled into an awkward squatting position on her branch, her eyes pleading with Lilly, "Please, Lilly, please…you gotta go…hurry!"</p>
<p>The urgency and terror in her voice spurred Lilly into action and she grabbed for the next branch to lower herself down. Then she noticed Miley wasn't following her and looked up. Miley hadn't moved at all, still crouched down on her branch, white as a ghost, while her hand was clamped around the branch.</p>
<p>"Miley, come on…" yelled Lilly and Miley's terrified eyes met hers again.</p>
<p>Miley's voice quivered, "Lilly, it's coming…it's coming…you won't make it."</p>
<p>Before Lilly had a chance to ask <b>what</b> was coming, Miley had stood up and was climbing around the side of the trunk. She stood on the farthest branch, not even bothering to hold on and Lilly yelled at her to come down. Her voice was swallowed by the wind. Then Miley ran. She leapt off the end of the branch, falling through the air for just a split-second, before a bolt of pure, white light shot into her. An ear-piecing clap rang through the air, followed by a thud. Then everything was silent.</p>
