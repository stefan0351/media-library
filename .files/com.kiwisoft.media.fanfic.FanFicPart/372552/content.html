<p><b>You guys are awesome! You had me laughing at some of your comments. I'm glad that it's coming across as something real, that has been my intention all along, a lot of the time you have no idea why you like someone, you're just blindsided. I digress, hope you enjoy!</b></p>
<p><b><hr size=1 noshade></b></p>
<p>The sun had been shining through the curtains for some time now, brightly illuminating the room that the girls were sleeping in. Quinn wasn't fully awake yet but she was beginning to stir, Rachel however had been awake for some time now. She'd awoken with the girl's arm wrapped securely around her, it was something the brunette had never experienced before, waking up in someone else's arms. She had to admit, it felt damn good. Rachel was idly drawing circles across the blonde's stomach when she heard a knock on the door. She moved away from the girl quietly, trying not to wake her, it failed miserably and Quinn immediately woke up, looking at the girl in confusion while attempting to pull the girl back towards her. The brunette began to shake her head when the door creaked open.</p>
<p>"Are you guys awake yet?"</p>
<p>Quinn straightened up slightly when she heard the protruding voice, the two girls were still too close to pull off the appropriate friendship sleeping distance but if either of them moved now it would look too obvious.</p>
<p>The blonde stretched her arms and wiped her eyes, "I am now" she told them</p>
<p>The brunette stayed still and quiet as she too leaned against the headboard.</p>
<p>"Oh okay, just checking" Santana said, "Some of us are gonna get going"</p>
<p>"Oh right, I'll be right down" the blonde told them, "Can you shut the door?" she asked, trying to be polite</p>
<p>Santana and Brittany narrowed their eyes but adhered to the girl's request.</p>
<p>Rachel jumped out of the bed as soon as the door clicked, in order to collect her things.</p>
<p>"Rachel" the blonde spoke</p>
<p>When the brunette continued to move about the room unaffected, the blonde resorted to getting up off of the bed.</p>
<p>"Berry" she said, holding the girls shoulders in place</p>
<p>"Yes, sorry"</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" she asked</p>
<p>"Yes, fine" she replied</p>
<p>Quinn could tell the girl was on edge, she found herself asking a question she wasn't sure she was ready to hear the answer to.</p>
<p>"Was last night.."</p>
<p>"Goodness no" she jumped in, knowing where the girl was going with this, she sighed, "I'm sorry, I just got a little spooked" She told Quinn, offering a smile</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" the blonde wanted assurance</p>
<p>The brunette threw her bag onto the bed, bringing both arms up to rest on the girls shoulders, locking her fingers around the back of Quinn's neck.</p>
<p>She gave her another soft smile, "Trust me" she gave the girl a warming kiss to confirm her words, "Not an ounce of regret" she told her, inches away from her face, "Do you?" she had to ask</p>
<p>The blonde chuckled to herself, "Look at me, do I look like someone that leaps out of bed for someone?" she asked</p>
<p>"Point taken" they both shared a laugh, "But I should be going, Sundays are kind of family day" she told her with a shrug</p>
<p>"Yeah, same here. My mom will be home soon anyway, I should straighten up the house"</p>
<p>Both girls smiled when neither let go of their grasp on the other.</p>
<p>"Okay" the blonde smiled</p>
<p>"Okay" the brunette beamed back</p>
<p>They shared one last kiss that ended too soon for the both of them before they finally forced themselves to let go.</p>
<p>Quinn said goodbye to her friends, and got right to work cleaning up the left over mess. Not wanting to upset her mother when she got back from a long and tiring weekend. She couldn't believe the difference in how the weekend started and how it ended, Friday afternoon she was practically foaming at the mouth, Sunday morning she was on cloud 9. She soon learned that sitting around the house for the rest of the day wasn't an option, she was going to go insane if she had to be confined. She needed something to keep her thoughts off of the brunette, she knew that seeing her that day would be out of the question, so she forced her mother to go out with her. They went shopping for the majority of the day, catching a movie and going out for a late dinner, all things that attempted but didn't succeed in bringing Quinn's thoughts away from the singer.</p>
<p>Rachel too was walking on air for the rest of the day, she'd been in a trance ever since she said goodbye to the cheerleader. Her father's noticed the sudden change in her behavior as well, they'd decided to let the girl bask in her good mood and not question it. She never thought Quinn could be so authentic, she never knew how many layers the girl really had. She loved every moment she got to spend with the girl, she liked that the blonde cared for her, that she looked out for her. Her feelings grew when she saw how Quinn reacted to the entire food debacle the night before, she liked the protective instinct that the cheerleader had, it made her feel worthy. They spent the entire night talking, talking! Rachel's next favorite thing to do behind singing, and she didn't once hear the other girl telling her to shut up. It was almost too good to be true, she was all about clich√©s and everything she used to describe the other girl was just that. After she'd spent nearly an hour picking out her clothing for the next day, she went to bed early, excited about what the next day was going to bring.</p>
<p>Rachel added a certain bounce to her step as she walked through the halls the next morning, her stomach was made of entirely butterflies as she turned the corners, hoping to see Quinn but scared at the same time. She was unsure of how the girl would act towards her, the weekend was good and nice but it was almost as if they were back to reality. After her 4th period, she stopped at her locker to grab some of her books, she was somewhat hoping that Quinn would magically be there next to her when she shut the locker door. Instead the girl snuck up from the other side of her, jolting the brunette into a yelp as she nudged her back. The blonde was utterly amused with herself.</p>
<p>"I've been looking for you" the blonde said after her laughter died down, "I wanted to tell you that I kind of missed you yesterday after you left" she leaned against the lockers</p>
<p>The brunette prevented herself from doing a back flip at the blonde's confession, instead she busied herself by tucking a piece of hair behind her ear.</p>
<p>"And to tell you that I don't think I'm going to be in lunch today"</p>
<p>Since joining Glee, the members tended to sit with each other out of preference.</p>
<p>The brunette was concerned, "Is everything okay?" she asked, refraining from touching the girl</p>
<p>"Yeah, Coach Sylvester has been up my ass, I'm just trying to get back on her good side so I was going to run through routines" she told the girl</p>
<p>The brunette nodded, understandingly but a little disappointed.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's just a cover, I don't think I'll be able to contain myself around you in front of everyone at lunch" she admitted, biting her lip. She was hoping that she'd be able to get away with the white lie but she found she couldn't.</p>
<p>The brunette chuckled, "I understand"</p>
<p>"I'll see you after school?"</p>
<p>The brunette once again nodded, almost star struck.</p>
<p>Quinn flashed her a wide smile before she trotted off down the hallway towards her next class.</p>
<p>The girls passed each other a few times in the hallway between that point and the end of the day, they'd stared intently at one another every time they saw each other. The final bell rang and both girls sighed relief.</p>
<p>Rachel was already seated in the front row before Quinn got to the choir room, she saw both Finn and Tina sit on either side of the brunette as she walked in. Frowning momentarily she decided it was probably for the best, besides she could stare at the brunette from the back row without being so blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>Mr. Schuester walked in moments later clapping his hands, "Okay, how was the weekend? What did we learn?" he was particularly excited about the day's meeting, he wanted to see if they learned anything new about their fellow members.</p>
<p>Everyone looked around all thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>"We learned that Quinn has a weird obsession with making sure Rachel has her vegan food" Kurt said</p>
<p>"Oh and that Quinn would hook up with Berry, if it meant saving the world" Noah added and smirked at the blonde next to him.</p>
<p>"Bite me Puckerman" the blonde said through her teeth, she was sure her face was as red as it was hot.</p>
<p>"Now, what happened last time?" he quipped back</p>
<p>Quinn was moments away from getting out of her chair and jumping on the boy to wipe the smug smile off of his face.</p>
<p>"Alright, enough" Mr. Schuester cut in, "Anything else?"</p>
<p>Quinn looked around, daring anyone else to say anything about her.</p>
<p>Rachel raised her hand.</p>
<p>"What did I say about the hand raising?" Mr. Schuester asked, but realized it wasn't going anywhere, "Okay, Rachel"</p>
<p>The brunette put her hand down and began talking, "I learned that as much as everyone tends to enjoy commentating on my wardrobe preferences or roll their eyes at my incessant rants, it doesn't mean that they won't indeed have my back when I should need it." She smiled, the rest of the group smiled as well</p>
<p>"Furthermore" she started, cueing the groans, "I think this is a vast improvement, and to know that we're all there for each other will help us tremendously in the future with dance sequences and performances" she ended</p>
<p>Everyone looked on, questioning if she was going to continue. Quinn could only gaze at her with wonderment, she was so amused and enticed by the brunette. She had a smile on her face when Puck leaned over to her.</p>
<p>"Nice smile"</p>
<p>Her smile vanished and the fire was back in her eyes, she leapt out of the chair, "I'm going to kill you" she yelled at the boy startling everyone</p>
<p>"That's enough" Mr. Schuester had to cut in again</p>
<p>The brunette looked to Quinn, making eye contact with her. It was almost as if she had no control over her body because the second Rachel sought out her eyes, she relaxed immensely.</p>
<p>"Why don't you guys get with your partners and start thinking up song ideas for your Friday performance" he told them</p>
<p>Quinn sighed, unsure of why she was getting so worked up over Puckerman's words.</p>
<p>Rachel went off to the corner she tended to migrate to when she was preparing something, the blonde was there a few seconds later.</p>
<p>"You okay?" the brunette asked</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm good now"</p>
<p>The brunette smiled, eventually it won the blonde over and she too smiled. Instead of working on their song, they found themselves talking about their days. It wasn't like Rachel to stray from the task at hand but she couldn't help it.</p>
<p>Before they knew it, the hour and a half was up.</p>
<p>As they gathered their things to leave, Mercedes, Tina, Artie and Kurt approached Rachel.</p>
<p>"Hey we were thinking about grabbing an early dinner, you in?"</p>
<p>The brunette's eyes found Quinn's for a brief second from across the room.</p>
<p>"Actually, Quinn and I were going to, ya know, do the assignment" she said</p>
<p>"But you were just working on it" Tina reminded her</p>
<p>"I know but well we were thinking, we still need to get to know each other more to pick the appropriate song"</p>
<p>"Fabray" Mercedes called out to the blonde who was mid conversation with Brittany and Santana.</p>
<p>She approached the group, "You're hanging out with Berry?" the girl asked</p>
<p>She looked around at the four of them, eyes landing briefly once again on the brunettes.</p>
<p>"Um, yeah. We need to" She swallowed looking back to Mercedes, "work on our song"</p>
<p>She hoped that's what the girl had told them, they hadn't made any plans yet for after glee practice. The blonde was hoping that they could hang out alone she just didn't ask yet.</p>
<p>"Okay then" Mercedes said, "Have fun"</p>
<p>The four inquiring minds left the room, Rachel mouthed thank you to the girl, which she nodded her welcome. The rest of their friends were gone and it was just the two of them.</p>
<p>"So are we really hanging out?" Quinn asked hopeful</p>
<p>"If you'd like to" the brunette replied</p>
<p>"Well I guess we should, we didn't really work on the song" the blonde reminded her</p>
<p>Rachel gasped, completely not realizing how unprepared they were. Quinn could see the panic on her face and couldn't help but find it adorable.</p>
<p>"C'mon" she laughed, "Let's get to work"</p>
<p>The girls dropped their bags back onto the desks and both girls pulled out their laptops, hoping to find a song that they could sing as a duet. It was virtually impossible to find a song when you were looking for one. Most of the time they just came to you.</p>
<p>Quinn huffed her hair out of her eyes and shut her laptop after about an hour of looking through her playlist and searching lyrics online. Her stomach growled signaling to her that it was probably almost 6 o'clock.</p>
<p>"This is never gonna happen" the blonde said after a while</p>
<p>Rachel too closed her laptop, "What are we going to do?" she asked</p>
<p>"Chinese?" the blonde wiggled her eyebrows</p>
<p>There was no way the brunette could turn down Quinn's proposal after the look she gave her. She relented and the cheerleader jumped up and down.</p>
<p>The car ride was relatively quiet, mostly because the blonde was thinking about what she was going to get. She flipped through the stations on the radio until they could find something without commercials.</p>
<p>"Wait go back" Rachel said, hearing a song she knew</p>
<p>She went back to the right station and Rachel immediately began bopping her head, suddenly belting the words to the song. Quinn looked on in amusement as the brunette began clapping along to the beat. With a few more nudges from the girl, the blonde finally gave in and joined her in the singing. Both girls were smiling and enjoying each other's company.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Rachel yelled, causing the blonde to nearly slam on the brakes, "This song! We could sing this song!" she poured</p>
<p>"This song?" Quinn asked, listening a bit to the words as the song continued to play, "Sure I guess, is it too forward?" she asked</p>
<p>"We can chop it up, but it's so in our vocal range and I'm imagining a dramatic crescendo, with a slow motion montage of emotions" the brunette turned to the girl excitedly</p>
<p>"Okay, I don't know what any of that means but I trust you" she told the girl</p>
<p>Rachel squealed in delight as she'd found a song they could sing.</p>
<p>Quinn shook her head laughing, she reached over to grabbed the brunette's hand out of her lap, clasping them together.</p>
<p>Dinner at the Chinese restaurant was spent in giggles as Rachel conjured up all kinds of things they could do to make their performance even better. The blonde was down for anything, as long as the brunette continued to give her that spotlight smiled that she'd grown fond of. The rest of the time was spent trying to guess what the other groups would sing as their relationship song, which still equaled laugher for the girls.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Quinn dropped the girl off at her house. Not without a pretty serious make out session in the car. Luckily it was dark by the time they pulled up to the house, as well as pouring rain. They were nestled safely inside the warm car, out of harm's way for the time being. Neither wanted to say goodbye but knew that after a while, Rachel's father would come out demanding to know if she was being held for ransom or not. With one last kiss, the girls said goodbye for the night, only because they made plans to go and get breakfast the following morning before school.</p>
<p>Rachel was outside just as the car was pulling up, making sure the girl wouldn't have to honk. Besides the blonde sent the girl at least 5 text messages telling her the estimated time of arrival. They'd agreed that they wouldn't talk on the phone before bed because that would result in another all nighter, no one said anything about texting. It took the brunette almost 10 minutes after she got into her room to figure out that there was a loophole. She enjoyed texting with Quinn, the things she said were thoughtful, and sweet. Rachel found herself blushing much more than she would in person, she was also able to display her reaction without looking like a loser.</p>
<p>The girls walked down the empty hallway together, they were there extra early, not knowing what to do with themselves.</p>
<p>"Hi girls" a man said from behind them</p>
<p>Both girls turned around to see their Glee advisor with a stack of papers in his hand.</p>
<p>"Hi Mr. Shue" Rachel beamed brightly in a particularly good mood that morning.</p>
<p>Breakfast had gone off without a hitch, she knew that Quinn wasn't as big of a morning person as the brunette but she appreciated the effort none the less. The blonde even made it seem like she was enjoying it, Rachel hoped that she actually was.</p>
<p>"What are you guys doing here so early" he asked looking at his watch, students didn't normally start coming in for another 15 minutes</p>
<p>"We went to get breakfast" Rachel told him</p>
<p>Mr. Schuester looked towards the blonde to see if this was accurate, Quinn gave him a smile.</p>
<p>"Wow, I'm extremely proud of you two. You're really taking this seriously" he applauded them</p>
<p>The brunette curtseyed for the older man in appreciation for the compliment.</p>
<p>The teacher walked off to get to his classroom and the blonde dragged the other girl along while laughing beside her on way.</p>
<p>The rest of the day went by just like the previous, Mr. Schuester made a scene to the club however about Rachel and Quinn's excellent display of leadership and resolve. Both girls were severely blushing and desperately trying to hide it from the others. Rachel insisted that the girls practice their number in solitary confinement, as to not give away what they were working on. He granted them their wishes, once again gushing about their initiative, the brunette simply lit up.</p>
<p>They practiced their number for quite a long time, not even knowing if the rest of the club was still in the building. Quinn dropped the girl off at her house once again, in the same fashion. Only this time, Mr. Berry number 1 was waiting by the window to find out who the mysterious person was that had her daughter belting songs about love in the shower.</p>
<p>"Incoming" the blonde told the brunette as she was going to get out of the car</p>
<p>"I'll see what he wants" the girl told Quinn</p>
<p>Rachel bounced out of the car, giving her father a kiss on the cheek. "Hi Daddy, was there something you needed?" she asked sweetly</p>
<p>"Who's your friend?" he asked, surveying the tinted windows of the car</p>
<p>"Quinn" the brunette told her father, hoping the man wouldn't remember the name from the many times she was sobbing in her bedroom.</p>
<p>"Ask Quinn if he wants to stay for dinner" the man said, "We'd love to meet him, is this the football boy or whatever that you're always talking about" he asked, smiling at his daughter, gesturing to the car.</p>
<p>"No Daddy, that's Finn. This is Quinn, and I'll ask <i>her</i>"</p>
<p>The man studied his daughter briefly before a wide smile broke out onto his face, "Even more exciting, now she simply must" he told the girl before walking back into the house to set another place at the table she assumed.</p>
<p>She opened the car door again, "Please don't hate me" she winced</p>
<p>"Never, what is it?" she asked</p>
<p>"Well they've insisted that you stay for dinner, that is, if you'd like to and if it's okay with your mother" she told the girl</p>
<p>The blonde turned the key in the ignition, and threw the keys into her pocketbook before getting out of the car to join the girl.</p>
<p>"Really?" the brunette asked</p>
<p>"Of course" she told her, "Besides I haven't seen my dad in 6 months, now I get to be with two" she teased</p>
<p>The brunette frowned at the mention of Mr. Fabray, she knew that his daughter was still devastated over everything and resented him a great deal for what she's been through. At least she was able to make a joke of it however.</p>
<p>The brunette took the girls hand and they made their way up the walkway to where the door was left open for them. The aroma of food instantly hit their noses and Quinn hadn't realized how hungry she actually was. She'd never been in the girl's house before, it was very quaint and comfortable. Nothing like the house that she grew up in, the art decorating the walls meant something more than it just being an expensive piece of artwork. There were family pictures everywhere, along with a festive feel to it.</p>
<p>The girls walked into the dining room where the same man that was outside was now putting food onto the table, which Quinn noticed was already set for four.</p>
<p>"So nice to meet you Quinn" the man held out his hand as he walked towards the girls, "I'm so thrilled you could join us tonight, we made Rachel's favorite too"</p>
<p>The blonde took it, giving her full smile to the man, his eyes were warm and his smile was welcoming.</p>
<p>"Thank you for inviting me, it smells delicious" she was always an appealing young lady when dealing with adults, thanks to her Saturdays at the country club.</p>
<p>"Who is this stunningly beautiful young lady in our home?" another man sung as he made his way to his husband and the girls.</p>
<p>"You're speaking of Rachel I'm sure"</p>
<p>Rachel looked towards the girl, she wasn't sure if Quinn was comfortable with being themselves in front of the girl's parents. She hadn't given it much thought.</p>
<p>The man held his hand to his chest, "My, a looker <i>and </i>a charmer" he winked at the girl, embracing her into one of his bone crushing hugs.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you Quinn, I'm Roger, Rachel's handsome father" he told her</p>
<p>"And I suppose that would make me Brian, the ugly one" the other man joked. The two shared a laugh with each other and Quinn felt herself smile at the natural exchange.</p>
<p>"And sweetheart" he kissed his daughter's forehead before he crushed her as well in one of his hugs.</p>
<p>"Girls, sit" Brian told them</p>
<p>"Yes, please" Roger ushered them towards their chairs.</p>
<p>The girls sat on one side across from the two men.</p>
<p>The men scooped some pasta on the girls plates, while Rachel passed the girl some salad dressing for the side salad.</p>
<p>"So tell us, we're dying to know" Roger spoke up</p>
<p>"Dad" Rachel warned, not wanting to put Quinn on the spot</p>
<p>"What? Sue me if I want to know the details" he teased back</p>
<p>"Roger" the other man also warned</p>
<p>The man leaned across the table towards Quinn, "Not only is he the ugly one but he's the boring one too" he stage whispered, getting the blonde to laugh.</p>
<p>She swallowed her food before beginning to talk, "Rachel and I are working on something for Glee Club, we're partners"</p>
<p>"Partners or <i>Partners?</i>" the man asked, only teasing</p>
<p>The blonde laughed again heartily, looking over towards the brunette, "Both I'm hoping" she replied in a bold move</p>
<p>Rachel choked on the water she was sipping, Quinn's hand immediately went to her back to make sure she was okay.</p>
<p>"You okay?" the blonde asked quietly</p>
<p>The brunette gave her a nod, she really wasn't expecting the comment, not that she wasn't doing cartwheels on the inside.</p>
<p>Brian slammed his napkin down on the table, startling the girls "What? Rachel, how could you?" he said in a booming voice, "You know how incredibly homophobic your father is" he finished with a smile</p>
<p>"He's right, I can't have that in this house" the other man joined along</p>
<p>Rachel released her breath, as did Quinn. Both thought that the man was upset for a different reason, considering technically their prior relationship consisted of Quinn bullying their daughter.</p>
<p>"See Quinn, I can be the funny one sometimes" Brian smiled at her</p>
<p>"It's rare, but it does happen" the other man added</p>
<p>Both men smiled at each other brightly.</p>
<p>"I must say, I'm proud of you Rachel" Brian told the girl</p>
<p>The brunette gave him a small smile before he continued, "Although, I won't be able to rough you up a little bit if you break my baby's heart" he added, directing his attention towards Quinn.</p>
<p>"Technically I'm a queen" the other man raised his hand, before pointing his fork at the girl, "So prepare for a catfight"</p>
<p>"Dad, you wouldn't harm a fly" Rachel teased her father</p>
<p>"It's true, he's afraid of them" the other man joked</p>
<p>The rest of the dinner went on in that fashion, Quinn found herself constantly laughing and having an amazing time with the brunette and her family. They were likeable and made the girl feel right at home. They adored their daughter and each other, the blonde almost didn't want to leave when the night came to an end. The brunette ushered her towards the door when one of the men brought out the baby photos, though the blonde very badly wanted to see them, she was promised that she could this weekend when she came back.</p>
<p>Rachel walked her to the door, "let me get shoes on" the brunette told her, "I'll walk you out"</p>
<p>"It's okay" the blonde held the girl in place, the brunette pouted causing Quinn to laugh, "You can watch me leave from the door" she tapped the girls nose</p>
<p>"Thanks for having dinner with me"</p>
<p>"I didn't embarrass you did I?" she asked, nervously</p>
<p>"No, I think my dads managed to do that enough on their own" she rolled her eyes, hinting annoyance</p>
<p>"I loved them" the blonde told the girl adamantly, "don't be embarrassed"</p>
<p>"I can't believe you were okay with telling them about us"</p>
<p>Quinn could only shrug, "I didn't want you to have to hide in your own house" she replied sincerely, "oh my god, were you not ready? I'm so sorry" the blonde covered her mouth with her hand, not even realizing what she'd done.</p>
<p>Rachel pulled her hand down, "Will you stop? You didn't do anything, I'm glad you told them, that they know I mean"</p>
<p>"I'll see you tomorrow?" the blonde asked</p>
<p>"Bright and early" the brunette reminded</p>
<p>The blonde rolled her eyes before bringing her lips to the girls, it was a short kiss, after all they both knew that Rachel's fathers were undoubtedly spying on them from two different corners of the house.</p>
<p>Quinn flashed another smile before she trotted down to the pathway towards her car.</p>
<p>Rachel stayed in the doorway as she waited for the girl to pull away, she stayed there long after the girl had pulled away in fact.</p>
<p>She felt an arm around her from behind, her father escorted her away from the door so that he could shut it.</p>
<p>They walked back into the living room where the other man was drinking a glass of wine.</p>
<p>"She's seems very different from the Quinn you used to talk about, are you sure they're the same girl?" her father Brian asked</p>
<p>The brunette looked at them both in shock, "You remembered?" she asked, hoping they wouldn't</p>
<p>"Do you think we don't listen to you when you come home from school utterly upset?"</p>
<p>She sat on the couch between them, "She's not the same person anymore, she's completely new and she's sincere, and"</p>
<p>"Rach honey, you don't have to explain anything to us" Roger told his daughter, "Sure she gave you a hard time, but she's also the reason for that very big smile on your face recently, and if you say she's a good person, I believe you" he pulled the girl into a hug, "Besides, I really like her, she laughed at my jokes" he told her, getting his daughter to finally laugh.</p>
<p>"Thanks, it means a lot. Your approval"</p>
<p>"If the way she was looking at you is any indication, I would say that she feels pretty strongly about you" the other man told her</p>
<p>A weight was lifted off of the blonde's chest as she drove away, it felt good to have her first admission of feelings for the brunette out loud to receive such a positive response. It definitely helped her realize that she could do this, the real thing. She'd admit that she was nervous upon meeting the girl's fathers, after all they were probably the only friends she had for a very long time, she could tell they were still very protective over her. She went straight to her room upon arriving home. She didn't bother to call the brunette, she'd liked texting the girl the night before, she didn't know what to expect whenever her phone would chime.</p>
<p>Rachel was relieved that her fathers were so forgiving, she felt the hardest part of the relationship was convincing them that Quinn had changed. She wasn't the same girl that she was the previous school year. She'd been nervous to allow the girl to stay for dinner, it certainly surprised her when the blonde agreed to stay for the night. She knew that her parents were a lot to take in upon meeting them but surprisingly they were well tamed, sure they'd embarrassed her a bit but Quinn seemed to enjoy their company. She'd never had a friend over for dinner before, she was too nervous about the rumors they'd start about her the next day, not everyone at McKinley High had two gay parents, that just wasn't press that she wanted.</p>
<p>"Hi" the brunette said as she snuck up behind the blonde while she was at her locker.</p>
<p>Quinn turned around swiftly, flashing a huge grin at the girl, she was hoping that the brunette would seek her out. The blonde was at lunch that day, she'd managed to tame herself long enough for 45 minutes to be in the brunettes company in front of other people. She wasn't sure if it was a good idea, nervous that it would be a dead giveaway to the others that something was up between them. The look on Rachel's face was enough to reassure her that it was all worth it. She shined when she saw the cheerleader walk into the cafeteria, it took Quinn all her effort to only show a smile half the size of the one that she originally wanted to.</p>
<p>"Hi"</p>
<p>Quinn went in to give the girl a hug, Rachel tensed up, unsure if it was actually okay that they were touching in public.</p>
<p>"I was thinking, maybe you could have dinner at my house tomorrow night" the blonde told the girl</p>
<p>Rachel was taken aback at first.</p>
<p>"Are you sure? Is that, okay?"</p>
<p>Quinn shut her locker, shouldering her purse and the two began to walk towards the choir room slowly.</p>
<p>"Yeah I mean, after last night, I really want you to meet my mom" the blonde told her, fiddling with her hands, she didn't know why she was so nervous, she'd gone over in her head what she wanted to say a thousand times while she was in English.</p>
<p>The brunette stayed silent, playing with the straps of her backpack, she didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>The blonde noticed the hesitation and continued to speak, hoping to convince the girl, "I mean, my mom has to work late tonight so she promised tomorrow night, I was thinking since I got to have your favorite dish, well I'll make you mine. And I guess we can work on our song" she added hoping the get some kind of reaction out of the girl, "Please say something"</p>
<p>The brunette stopped a few yards from the choir room door.</p>
<p>"I'd love to Quinn, I'm just surprised is all. I mean last week you didn't even want to be my partner and now last night you're telling my parents you're hoping that we'll be something, it's just‚Äî"</p>
<p>"God, I knew you were upset with me about that" the blonde begins to berate herself</p>
<p>"I'm not, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around it all. I'm just afraid one day there will be a slushie behind your back and it will all be a bad joke" the brunette told her honestly</p>
<p>Though the brunette said it through a laugh, Quinn could feel the truth in what she was saying, she understood. It stung the cheerleader, worse than she thought it would have. It wasn't the words that hurt her but the skepticism and sadness in the brunette's tone.</p>
<p>"Hey" the blonde reached out for her arm, pulling her towards the side of the hallway, "I would never do that to you"</p>
<p>The brunette gave her a look, the blonde rolled her eyes, "ever again" she added for the girl, "You have my word, I would never hurt you intentionally like that" she told the girl, looking into her eyes so she could feel the depth of the blonde's promise. "I may not be ready to tell the world about us, this is new for me. But I don't want you to think that because I'm not ready doesn't mean I don't want this. I want to do it right, without the pressure from everyone else"</p>
<p>"I understand, I'm not ready for that press either. Though I don't know how much longer we can keep Kurt off of our trail. He's a bloodhound when it comes to stuff like this"</p>
<p>The blonde laughed heartily, before turning serious again, "You have to understand, not being able to kiss your doubt away right now is driving me wild" she sighed</p>
<p>They both shared a small laugh, Rachel shook her head, "Sorry, I didn't mean for it to just get so heavy, I gladly accept your invitation to join you for dinner at your home"</p>
<p>Quinn flashed her a full smile, "good because I wasn't going to take no for an answer" she teased</p>
<p>They picked up their pace again and started walking towards the choir room once again. The blonde saw someone walking toward them from the opposite end of the hallway, her smiled quickly turned into a scowl. The brunette next to her seemed to be blissfully unaware and she was ushered into the room, the cheerleader following her.</p>
<p>They took their seats as they waited for Mr. Schuester to come in and give them direction. After about 5 minutes of idle chatter, the teacher finally came in.</p>
<p>"Rachel"</p>
<p>"Yes Mr. Schuester" she asked, nervous that she was in trouble</p>
<p>"Jesse is outside in the hallway asking for you" he told her, scanning his eyes over the rest of the group, "He wants to speak with you"</p>
<p>The rest of the club looked on with eager eyes, although each was scared they were going to be in trouble for the stunt they pulled the weekend prior.</p>
<p>Quinn watched the girl, trying to act indifferent but it was proving to be a difficult task. Her eyes were trained on the back of the girl as she walked away slowly out into the hallway, out of everyone's ear shot.</p>
<p>"What's that punk even doing here?" Puck muttered under his breath with disgust.</p>
<p>"I heard he stayed back, since Shelby adopted your baby and all" Kurt announced as he studied his cuticles.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna go beat his face in" Puck announced decidedly</p>
<p>"Enough" the teacher halted him.</p>
<p>Mr. Schuester began to discuss something but the entire classroom wasn't paying attention, too worried about the girl out there with the devil himself. They all knew that she forgave easily, too easily. Quinn's mind was reeling, she didn't trust the boy an ounce. She knew he was bad for the girl, playing with her mind; convincing her that he was good just to crush her in the end. It was sadistic really, the blonde was being selfish in that moment, not wanting the girl to get hurt. She was completely overlooking the fact that the brunette gave her a second chance.</p>
<p>She walked back in almost a minute later, avoiding everyone's gaze, including the blondes.</p>
<p>"What'd he want?" Puck found himself asking, the rest of the room thankful that he asked, the elephant in the room was far too much for their drama deprived bodies.</p>
<p>"He only asked to meet me at a later time" she started, "to discuss things" she added the last part, waiting for the backlash.</p>
<p>Almost the entire room groaned or rolled their eyes, including Mr. Schuester.</p>
<p>"It's just dinner, nothing will happen. I just want to hear what he has to say" she said defensively, looking around to stare at all of them.</p>
<p>She hadn't known why she'd agreed to meet, she knew that no one would be thrilled of the news, but she couldn't turn her back without hearing what he had to say.</p>
<p>"After all that he's done to you?" Quinn asked, unable to keep her mouth shut.</p>
<p>"Like you care about Rachel" Puck commented</p>
<p>"No, Quinn's right." Mercedes spoke up, "He's a complete jerk Rachel"</p>
<p>"Yeah, how do you know that this isn't a set up again" Tina asked worried</p>
<p>The blonde was happy that she wasn't the only one that was upset by this news.</p>
<p>"I appreciate everyone's concern, I really do. But this is something I need to do, who am I to assume his motive, for all I know, he could be offering a peace treaty, or an apology. At the very least I should hear what he has to say" the brunette replied calmly, as to not get too worked up over this.</p>
<p>"at the very least?" the blonde scoffed "So what, if he tells you he loves you, you'll go right back to him?"</p>
<p>Everyone's eyes widened and directly went to the visibly upset blonde; to say they were confused at the sudden outburst was no exaggeration.</p>
<p>"What? Quinn no, why would you assume that" she asked spinning around to face the girl who was uncharacteristically seated next to her.</p>
<p>The blonde stood up from the chair she'd been clutching onto with white knuckles, unable to sit still anymore. She began pacing back and forth, muttering things under her breath. She'd completely lost her mind and she didn't care who was witness to it, at least not in this moment. She was far to heated to see logic and reason.</p>
<p>"Jesse is gay Rachel!" Quinn shouted finally</p>
<p>Everyone's eyes went wide, including Kurt's, who should have known all along.</p>
<p>The brunette took in her words, "Why would you say such a thing?" she asked, disbelieving</p>
<p>"Because I saw him kissing the guy when we were tee-peeing his house" she told her, accidentally letting Mr. Schuester know of their deed.</p>
<p>"That's impossible" the brunette said shaking her head, not willing to believe it still.</p>
<p>The blonde stopped pacing to stare at the other girl incredulously; she couldn't believe that the brunette wouldn't trust her in this. Oh, she was mad.</p>
<p>"Why else do you think I would kiss you Rach, I was trying to distract you"</p>
<p>The truth was out.</p>
<p>Few things happened in the next moment. The blonde continued to stare at the brunette, her eyes unwavering. The brunette tried to look away, but she was rendered powerless against the cheerleader she'd grown so close to over the past few days.</p>
<p>"Why else? You mean, it was just, it was just a.." Rachel tried to control her overflowing emotions, realizing that Quinn's motives had an ulterior purpose, that the kiss wouldn't have happened in a million years otherwise.</p>
<p>The blonde's eyes went wide when she realized what she had said, she never meant for it to sound like that, like it didn't mean anything to her, that it was all a lie. That she didn't want to kiss the girl, because she wanted to. The truth stung Rachel, it stung the blonde just as badly.</p>
<p>"You and <i>Rach</i>?" Finn asked after some silence, pointing back and forth utterly confused, "Kissed?"</p>
<p>It was then that the girls realized they were very much not alone, every pair of eyes were on them, watchful and stunned at the same time. They couldn't believe it, not even with all of the weird happenings between the girls, they never would have guessed in a million years that was what was really going on. So many things were going on throughout the minds of the rest of the group members, re-thinking the rare occurrences, remembering Quinn's mood swing over Rachel's food, remembering the girls shared a room at the sleep over, the smiles the blonde seemed to be wearing more and more, even her sudden change in the seating arrangement. Rachel's toned down demeanor should have been the biggest indicator, or the fact that Quinn was suddenly over protective of the girl she once loathed. Kurt especially felt stupid, missing such the obvious clue in the conversation he had with the cheerleader just days before.</p>
<p>The cheerleader gasped, it was all she could do. As she studied the faces staring back at her, she recognized that they had realized and fully grasped just how serious this was. That this wasn't just a kiss, that this was much bigger than that. They looked at her, waiting to see what she would do next, she couldn't take it. She needed get out of there so that's what she did. She left the room without another word, running through the hallways without paying attention to where she was going. She pushed the door open to the outside and continued to run, until her calves started to burn and her lungs were about to give out. She couldn't believe all that just happened in the past 5 minutes, a day that started out so well managed to derail, crash and burn in the blink of an eye. She couldn't imagine what Rachel was dealing with right now, under scrutiny from the rest of the club, her heart ached for the girl but she couldn't show her face again after that.</p>
<p>She felt just about the same as when everyone found out that she was pregnant, only somewhat worse, she managed to hurt someone she cared about on the way down.</p>
