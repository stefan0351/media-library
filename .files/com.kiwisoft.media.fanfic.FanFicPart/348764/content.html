<p>Seven and B'Elanna made their way slowly back to Dannan's house in the icy night, with nothing heard but the crunching of pebbles under their feet. Though outwardly the lieutenant remained tough, Seven knew she was injured enough so that her normal pace was hindered. The ex-drone could hear the quiet winces and occasional deep breaths in attempt to hide pain.</p>
<p>"I thought you promised me you wouldn't go there," B'Elanna asked, turning her head to glance at Seven.</p>
<p>"You requested that I not go there, but I only promised not to be seen, at least, not during the tournament," answered Seven. "If you recall, I am very literal."</p>
<p>B'Elanna chuckled, shaking her head at how the Borg managed to twist things around. </p>
<p>"How did you know Kal...? What did you say...? LenNokk&#133;. How did you...?"  B'Elanna fumbled over her questions, at a loss for words.</p>
<p>"I.......improvised," Seven replied, her lips quirked, as they reached the gate to the house. B'Elanna smiled in return, realizing being with Seven would always involve a bit of surprise every now and then, and she liked it.</p>
<p>The lights in the common room were on, bathing the front enclosure with soft illumination. Quietly, they opened the door to the home, careful not wanting to disturb anyone sleeping inside. Dannan sat alone at the long table, facing the entry, when they walked in. B'Elanna halted just inside the door, wondering what the good-hearted man was thinking. Dannan rubbed the stubble on his chin as he looked at the young woman, ay women, he had come to know well over the past few days. He carefully took in the dark circles under the lieutenant's eyes, one of them swollen, the cut above her brow, and reddened lips, but otherwise, she looked alive and in one piece. He stood up and walked over to the half-Klingon, then wordlessly, embraced her for a brief moment. </p>
<p>Looking away, he whispered to them, "Well, looks like everything's okay. I'll get you some healing packs before you go to bed."</p>
<p>He clasped Seven's hand gently for a second before he left the room. Seven turned back to B'Elanna, and saw wet tears glistening in the half-Klingon's eyes. Without further delay, B'Elanna went straight to their room, weary of the long day, with its emotional roller-coaster, and wanting only to fall into bed. Seven followed her in after obtaining the healing gel packs from Dannan, and closed the door. By then, the Klingon had dropped her holster, cloak, and boots on the floor, and was splayed out on the cot, lying on her belly. Frowning with disapproval, Seven walked over to the resting woman and started pulling her clothes off. Too exhausted to object, she let the Borg remove her clothing, vaguely aware that Seven was not stopping when she reached her underwear. When Seven finally slid the remaining clothing off, she paused.</p>
<p>"I forgot about this..." Seven spoke hesitantly.</p>
<p>"What?" B'Elanna asked in alarm, suddenly remembering where Seven had visual access to, and wondering what exactly she meant.</p>
<p>"This...," she answered, brushing her hand lightly over the triangle.</p>
<p>"Hhsss, ow!" B'Elanna winced, grabbing onto Seven's wrist to keep her from touching the tender area. "It's still a little sore."</p>
<p>B'Elanna had thought she spent an eternity under EnNokkia's ministrations, and afterwards, she felt she could barely walk. The Klingon had to admit, however, she was impressed, and the girl was very skillful. It was one of the most erotic experiences she had ever had in her entire life, though bathing Seven was at the top of the list.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry.... I will be gentle," Seven replied, trying not to grin.</p>
<p>"How did you know I got a tattoo?" B'Elanna uttered through the pillow, letting go of her forearm.</p>
<p>"I was not completely certain, but I did notice your opponent appeared well-decorated on his upper torso."</p>
<p>"Mmm..." came the muffled response.</p>
<p>Gingerly, she placed a healing pack on the tattoo, but after she had gotten a better look at the intricate design of the EnNokk crest, where it had been etched just at the apex of B'Elanna's firm buttocks. She also examined the Klingon head to toe, making note of all the bruises, cuts, and contusions among other things. B'Elanna had a rather large contusion on the left side of the small of her back, and Seven covered it with another pack, hoping it would help speed the mending. Silently, she ran the tricorder over B'Elanna's body, and sighed deeply when she read the reassuring findings. She thought her cardiovascular systems had ceased to function when she watched as the lieutenant was attacked brutally during the first round.</p>
<p>"I did it...," B'Elanna murmured, turning her face toward the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>"Did what?" Seven asked in a hushed voice, as she knelt down, softly stroking the tired woman's back.</p>
<p>"I showed them that I am a Klingon warrior...."  B'Elanna opened her eyes for a second and peered at Seven.</p>
<p>"Yes," the Borg answered, nodding as she bent down, and placed a kiss on her forehead.</p>
<p>Seven whispered for her to go to sleep, and watched as B'Elanna's eyelids drooped shut before she draped a blanket over the lieutenant. Had someone told her a couple of weeks ago that she would be making such small gestures of affection and compassion, she would have responded with disbelief and cynicism at her own capabilities. But being around B'Elanna Torres made such thoughts and actions natural, almost instinctual to her now. Turning down the lights, Seven stepped quietly out of their quarters, and heard shuffling noises coming from the common room. She walked through the archway and found Moka busy at the hearth, though the hour was late. The ex-drone took the shawl off the back of a chair, and wrapped it around the shoulders of the small, dear woman that had spent so much of her time caring for their daily needs. Moka smiled, knowing just who the person standing behind her was.</p>
<p>"Is Bey asleep?" she asked, removing the baked treats from the oven.</p>
<p>"Yes. Did we wake you when we entered?" Seven inquired, worried they had disturbed the woman.</p>
<p>"No, I couldn't sleep knowing you both were still outside, at the tournament." Moka indicated to Seven to sit at the table as she brought over the plate of snacks for them to eat.</p>
<p>"We did not intend to cause you and Dannan any distress. You both have given us much assistance for the past several days, and it has been...comforting to live here," Seven told her sincerely. "I do not know the words to expression our appreciation for all you have done."</p>
<p>"Oh, child, it has been no trouble at all. Enjoyed the company, yes we have," she replied, trying to put Ani at ease.  "I'm certain it hasn't been easy for either of you being stranded here on this planet away from your family. Just glad that the two of you were stranded together."</p>
<p>Seven stopped her munching, and glanced at Moka questioningly when she heard the last comment. It was unexpected, and sounded strange to her own ears. It surprised her to no end these past few days how her feelings had changed, or rather grown towards the lieutenant. Moka saw her expression, and knew instantly it was something she had to pursue. She didn't know much about robots, technology, space travel, and such, but she knew how to deal with relationships.</p>
<p>"You are not glad that you are here with Bey?" she asked.</p>
<p>Startled out of her reverie, Seven answered, "No, I am...grateful."</p>
<p>"I thought so. You two seem so close, sometimes practically joined at the hip like congenital twins," joked Moka.</p>
<p>Again, Seven found herself pausing to analyze the observation. "Our relationship would have been described as the opposite prior to our arrival on this planet. Our previous interactions were more...antagonistic." The ex-drone was almost ashamed to admit it.</p>
<p>It was Moka's turn to throw a questioning look. Now her interest was truly peaked.  "Antagonistic?...  Hmm, so different from each other were you then, ay?...I suppose I can see that," Moka pretended to concede, tugging on a earlobe as she pursed her lips in thought.</p>
<p>Seven quirked her brow, and replied, "On the contrary, Bey and I have many attributes in common. We both have proficiency in engineering, interest in the acquisition of knowledge, and we are both hybrids of two cultures, one of which we share. Human.... However, we each have had problems reconciling our two cultures, and as a result, that has caused us difficulties in our relationships with other members of our family."</p>
<p>She continued, "And Bey is intelligent, outspoken, moral, and truthful, characteristics which I find admirable...."  </p>
<p>Seven stopped her herself suddenly, wondering just when she had come to such conclusions about the lieutenant. Despite their argumentative interactions, they often worked on the same projects the Captain assigned them to. And Seven had taken ample opportunity to observe the Klingon during her romantic relationship with Tom Paris. Perhaps, she had discovered a kinship with B'Elanna, one that she didn't cared to admit in the past. </p>
<p>"If you share so much in common, why were you both at odds before?" Moka pressed.</p>
<p>"My family finds the Borg detestable for their ruthless pursuit of the assimilation of millions of individuals and the destruction of species. Many of them have lost friends and relatives," Seven explained, her voice pained. "When I was a member of the Borg, I had participated in such acts, and when I was freed, I had difficulty adjusting to my new life. Some of my behavior and appearance may serve to remind them of the Borg, including Bey." </p>
<p>"Surely, they cannot blame you?" Moka asked, doubtful that her family could not see the young woman for who she truly was. She gazed at the young woman warmly, hoping to ease Ani's own self-incrimination by letting her fondness for the young woman show through.</p>
<p>"I am Borg, and I have done things all Borg are guilty of. I will always be Borg..." Seven said bitterly, as she looked down.</p>
<p>Moka moved her chair over quickly, faster that Seven could believe she was able to, and cupped the Borg's face with a weathered hand so that Seven would look at her. </p>
<p>"See yourself negatively do you? No, not right. Would be an injustice, Ani. You are your own individual. What you choose to do with your life now is the only thing that matters. And I do not think Bey sees you that way, at least, not anymore," insisted Moka. "No, I KNOW she does not. Look in her eyes, find the truth for yourself if you still deny it."</p>
<p>Self-conscious, Seven blushed at the thought of being close to B'Elanna. Even now she felt the lieutenant's absence though the half-Klingon was exactly where she had left her. Moka put her arm around Seven's shoulders. Young love was painful, but it was also exhilarating and passionate if she remembered correctly. And it needed encouragement. </p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The ex-drone crept into the room quietly as not to wake the slumbering woman. B'Elanna laid there on the cot, not having moved one inch since she fell asleep. Seven leaned over to examine B'Elanna's wounds which appeared to have improved in the short amount of time. She brushed her hand over the Klingon's back, feeling the wonderfully smooth coffee skin at her fingertips.</p>
<p>'So...perfect,' she sighed mentally, despite the scattered bruises that colored the skin.</p>
<p>She wondered what it would feel like to have her bare skin next to B'Elanna's, but she refrained from finding out as she changed into her bedclothes. Without a sound, Seven slipped into bed and placed herself as close to B'Elanna as possible so that she could feel the warm heat that radiated from the strong body. B'Elanna must have somehow sensed the presence of her body because the Klingon turned her face away from the edge of the bed towards the young woman, and shifted her arm slightly until it bumped into Seven's side. When B'Elanna moaned her discontent, the blonde covered the small distance between them and gently lifted the lieutenant's head onto her shoulder, and wrapped an arm around the supple back. Finally, tired herself, Seven fell into contented sleep, holding the woman she was in love with.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Lt. B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer of the Federation Starship Voyager, half-Klingon was scared witless about what to do next. She woke up on this particular morning, nestled softly on what she thought was a comfortable bedding, for a few seconds before she realized what she was really cuddled up to. A perfumed bosom, a generous one she might add. Cracking open an eye, she gazed down at the cleavage hidden precariously by a low neckline, which brought to mind various uncensored imagery.</p>
<p>'Okay. Maybe I can move while Seven's asleep,' she considered, up until she felt Seven's hand move, lightly scratching her back in slow circles. 'Damn! Nix that.... Oh Kahless, that feels soooooo good...'</p>
<p>Things would have still been less embarrassing if B'Elanna didn't realize next that she was completely naked, not a stitch of clothing on, and in such a compromising position. She might as well have planted a flag on Seven while she was atop the Borg. </p>
<p>'Why does this keep happening???'</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that her knee was wedged between Seven's thighs didn't help matters all that much either. Well, she guessed it wasn't so bad since Seven had her nightgown on. But then again, the situation might have been salvageable if only the blonde's gown hadn't ridden up her thigh during the course of the night. As it were now, B'Elanna's sensitive flesh was pressed against a very toned leg, and the heat from the connection had generated a great deal of sweat between them, making the area sticky. As if it weren't hard enough for her to keep a respectful relationship with the young woman.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Seven analyzed the multitude of responses she detected from B'Elanna, the quickened beating of her heart that vibrated against her own chest, the increased respiratory rate, and the tensing of the Klingon's abdominal muscles she felt on her hip. When she had awakened earlier, Seven discovered their bodies intertwined, and relaxed into the embrace. She waited in amusement for B'Elanna's reaction, knowing full well the lieutenant would be flustered at the possible impropriety of the situation, a concept she found ridiculous. She did not expect, however, that her own body would respond in kind to the sensation of B'Elanna's hot, wet skin next to hers and to the pressure she felt between her legs, where it had begun to ache.</p>
<p>B'Elanna lifted her head and glanced at Seven, who felt the movement, and returned the look. There seemed to be an interminable amount of silence as both of them wondered if this was what it felt like to wake up to each other as lovers. B'Elanna reached up hesitantly, placing a chaste kiss on Seven's lips. The Borg's eyes widened slightly, expressing her pleasure at the act that spoke of familiarity.</p>
<p>"Good morning," the lieutenant murmured, still holding the gaze, relishing the effect of her kiss.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Bey," Seven whispered back, inspecting the Klingon's delicate features and noting with satisfaction that the injuries were disappearing.</p>
<p>"Do I look that bad?" asked B'Elanna with humor in her tone as she sat up, wrapping a sheet shyly around herself, and felt the tight knots in her back.</p>
<p>The shift caused their legs to disentangle, and they both sighed deeply when their intimate contact broke, the cool air drifting between their bodies. Seven felt the sweat on her thigh beginning to evaporate.</p>
<p>"No.... You are beautiful," Seven told her as she sat up too, bring their faces close.</p>
<p>"So are you," B'Elanna replied instinctively, her body flushing in reaction to the entire situation. </p>
<p>B'Elanna rubbed her lips distractedly as she contemplated the words she needed to say to Seven. The Borg seemed to sense her introspection and waited patiently. </p>
<p>"Seven," B'Elanna started, wanting the woman to understand who exactly she was addressing, and not the persons they were pretending to be.  "I just want to tell you how much I've come to appreciate who you are, after having gotten to know you better these past several days. I'm just sorry it didn't happen earlier on board Voyager, instead of here, under such forced circumstances..."</p>
<p>"I wish I hadn't been so blind-" B'Elanna couldn't finish as slender fingers stopped her lips.</p>
<p>"I do not want apologies. We have both misjudged each other," Seven answered, not removing her fingers as they traced the sensual mouth.</p>
<p>"I.... I like you, Seven. I like you very much," B'Elanna murmured, looking into large blue eyes with her heart exposed. She didn't want to overwhelm the young woman, and risk losing the bond they had formed so recently. </p>
<p>Seven was stunned for an instant as she processed the words, but slowly her eyes lighted with the smile that touched her features.</p>
<p>"I...like you very much, as well, B'Elanna," Seven acknowledged, moving closer to her objective. Moka was right. B'Elanna had feelings for her, the ones that she had wished her entire human existence for.</p>
<p>"I'm glad we're friends..."</p>
<p>"We're more than just friends," murmured Seven.</p>
<p>B'Elanna retreated slightly. "And Captain Janeway?" she asked, steadying herself for the answer.</p>
<p>Seven gaze curiously at B'Elanna, realizing that the lieutenant was inquiring about her relationship with the Captain. It seemed important to the half-Klingon, so she answered truthfully.</p>
<p>"The Captain and I are friends, and we have a close personal relationship. However, it does not preclude my current relationship with you, B'Elanna. I want to be with you," Seven replied, moving single-mindedly towards those lips again. </p>
<p>This time, B'Elanna didn't retreat as the Borg slipped her enhanced hand behind her head, entangling it through her hair, and pulled her in for a deep, searing kiss. Her heart was filled with indescribable joy knowing that Seven felt the same way and wanted the same thing. She let Seven do the exploring with her usual efficiency, and pretty soon, she felt herself pressed downward towards the pillows. B'Elanna jumped briefly when her back landed on the cot, and Seven detected the movement. Concerned, the ex-drone unceremoniously turned the Klingon over and pulled the sheet down to examine her back.</p>
<p>"Your injuries..."</p>
<p>"I'm alright, Seven. I was just surprised by the packs poking into my back," B'Elanna laughed softly.</p>
<p>Seven peeled away the healing packs, and found that the lieutenant was recovering quickly. The bruises and cuts were only faintly noticeable.</p>
<p>"The swelling from you contusion has decreased, and the skin decoration has healed," Seven noted.</p>
<p>A little of her jealous feelings returned when she pictured the Nokk leaning over her lieutenant, touching such an intimate area. She ran her hand over the intricate tattoo, and asked, "What happened after you followed the female into the tavern?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna reveled in the sensation of her touch. "You mean EnNokkia? She led me to the baths, and I cleaned up before her assistants came and showed me to her studio. All I did was lay there while she marked me."</p>
<p>"Were you unclothed?" Seven asked, gliding her fingertips along the Klingon's spine. </p>
<p>B'Elanna shivered under her strokes. "Where I needed to be," she answered vaguely, remembering how she laid face down on the couch, with only a towel covering her breasts as EnNokkia tended to her.</p>
<p>"Did she sit here?" Seven leaned her upper body over the back of the Klingon's thighs, and pulled the sheet lower, exposing the round derriere. She watched as the shallow dimples on either side of the muscular buttocks pinched when the lieutenant squirmed.</p>
<p>"Yes," B'Elanna whimpered, recalling the seductive, feminine surroundings, the fresh flowers scattered around her, and the attention she had received. </p>
<p>"Did she touch you here?" Seven questioned, placing her warm hands on the pliant cheeks, feeling the firmness under her palms.</p>
<p>"A few times," B'Elanna admitted, lost in the caress. The hands left her rump as Seven stood up abruptly.</p>
<p>"I see," Seven said, her tone hardened. With steel in her gaze, she told B'Elanna, "Perhaps, you would like to obtain more skin decorations while you are here, since you seemed to have enjoyed the experience."</p>
<p>And with that, she left in a huff to the washroom. B'Elanna plopped down into the pillows, half amused, half contrite that the Borg was mad again.</p>
<p>'So, my beautiful Borg's jealous.' She winced, 'I guess I should have known Seven's not like Tom, who wouldn't have minded a play-by-play of a little girl-on-girl action.... I guess I better try harder to woo Seven.'</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't mind as she eyed the door where Seven had left through. After all, she was already Seven-whipped. Besides, she enjoyed a challenge.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Edyn whistled on his way to Dannan's place. He had just dropped off the credits to the freighter captain, and was glad to hear that the man still honored his arrangements with Bey. He was anxious to see how the half-Klingon was doing after last night's fight. Edyn entered through the gate and knocked on the door until Dannan opened it. He found them all sitting at the table, enjoying breakfast together.</p>
<p>"Hello, hello. What's this? One of Moka's hearty breakfasts?" he inquired, setting his sights on the stack of fresh bacon, and his nose twitched as the smells wafted up to his nostrils. "Mmm...koli fruit crepes with fresh whipped cream, johish sausages, fried gilka eggs, diqui melons, and..."</p>
<p>Dannan laughed at the moocher, and invited him to join them. Edyn grabbed a seat by his prized fighter, since Ani seemed to be sitting a bit farther away this morning next to Moka. He winked at Bey as he nibbled on a piece of bacon, while she rolled her eyes in mirth.</p>
<p>"Morning, my bumpy beauty, and my lush lovely," he greeted Seven as well, wiggling his brows at her. "I gave the money to the pilot."</p>
<p>That caught their attention as all eyes pinned on him. Edyn continued, "He said he'll start the communiqu&eacute; as soon as he gets out of orbit."</p>
<p>"That's wonderful news," Dannan noted, even though inside, he lacked the enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"He should be moving through the sectors you think your family will pass through, if they haven't already. He's leaving in another ten parsecs. But he also said that he had room for one more passenger," Edyn added offhandedly, but he knew exactly what he was saying.</p>
<p>Everyone stopped eating while Seven and B'Elanna looked at each other intently. Edyn spied back and forth between the two women.</p>
<p>Finally, Seven answered, "We will leave together or not at all."</p>
<p>Smiling, B'Elanna took another bite of her crepe, and the rest of them resumed eating, and talked about idle things. The laughter and chatter inside the house could be heard from the streets. Even Fessi wandered over to the window, looking inside to find what all the commotion was about. </p>
