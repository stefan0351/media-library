<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Three -->

<p>It wasn't until the following afternoon, after Kara had worked through lunch
			again, that she decided to drive into town. She had brought most of the food she
			would need with her. Being a vegetarian, she couldn't always count on small town
			grocery stores having what she needed, but cream for her coffee was a necessity
			and she thought she would check out Louise's store. Maybe they would carry
			enough and she wouldn't have to make a trip into Seattle just to shop for food.
		</p>
		<p>She passed through the town, which was a stretch by anyone's imagination. A
			few stores, catering strictly to tourists, an old lodge that looked quite
			charming, and one gas station. At the edge of town, where the forest nearly
			swallowed it up, stood the general store. A log cabin, with porch and all, it
			looked as if it came right out of the last century. She parked her Land Cruiser
			next to a four-wheel drive Ford truck, looking like it had seen better days. She
			ran her hand affectionately across the hood of her Toyota, her pride and joy. It
			had been the first major purchase she?d made with her own money. </p>
		<p>She glanced above her head, admiring the freshly painted sign. Ginny?s
			General Store. A paper flyer taped to the window of the door offered fresh
			coffee and espresso. Another notified locals of the monthly bingo game at the
			community center. She grinned. Life moved a lot slower out here than in Seattle.
		</p>
		<p>Kara looked up as the bell above her head signaled her arrival and she walked
			into the store, glancing up to meet the friendly green eyes of the woman
			standing behind the counter. Kara held her gaze, the corner of her mouth lifting
			in a quick smile before looking away and she walked slowly down one of the rows
			of shelves lined with canned goods towards the cooler. She grabbed a carton of
			cream then turned and looked around. She spotted the espresso machine in the
			corner and made her way to that. A real cup of coffee with steamed milk nearly
			made her mouth water. </p>
		<p>"Why, Ms. Morgan, you found us," Nana called as she saw Kara. </p>
		<p>"Louise. Nice to see you again. I remembered you said you had coffee," Kara
			replied as she sipped from her cup. </p>
		<p>"Ginny's idea. She missed Seattle?s coffee, although I prefer just plain old
			roast," she said as she walked over to Kara and casually took her hand. "Come
			meet Ginny. "</p>
		<p>Kara looked again into sea-green eyes. "Hello. Kara Morgan. "She extended a
			hand in greeting. </p>
		<p>Ginny paused for only a moment, the slightly husky voice still vibrating in
			her ears. She reached out and touched her hand quickly. </p>
		<p>"Ginny Harrison. "</p>
		<p>"I'm so glad you decided to come by," Louise said. "I told Ginny about you. "
		</p>
		<p>"You did? "Kara glanced quickly at Ginny Harrison, watching as she nervously
			tucked strands of blonde hair behind her ears, then brushed at the bangs hanging
			in her eyes. </p>
		<p>"Yes, she did," Ginny said. "Welcome to Chiwaukum. She said you were staying
			at the Dobson place. " </p>
		<p>"For the summer, at least. "</p>
		<p>Their eyes met again and Kara was
			surprised at the gentle tug of attraction she felt for this woman. Her warm,
			green eyes seemed almost to beckon and Kara laughed to herself. The young woman
			was most likely straight. Her blonde hair was neatly styled, just barely
			brushing the tops of her shoulders in the back but shorter around her face and
			Kara was very conscious of her own hair, cut short over her ears and barely
			reaching her neck. With two fingers, she brushed it away from her forehead,
			finally pulling her eyes away and turning to Louise.
		</p>
		<p>"Your offer of coffee drew me," she said, sipping from her cup again. "I've
			missed Seattle's coffee, too. "</p>
		<p>"You and Ginny. That's all she complained about. Not a decent cup of coffee
			for miles, she kept saying. "</p>
		<p>Kara looked again at Ginny. "The espresso machine was a good idea. " </p>
		<p>Ginny grinned. "Absolutely. During the summer months, most of our customers
			are from Seattle. They need some place to go to get a cup of real coffee. "</p>
		<p>"Well, thank you," Kara said, raising her cup in salute. "What do I owe you?"She pulled a couple of bills from her front jeans pocket and handed them to
			Ginny. </p>
		<p>"Why don't you come for dinner tonight? " Louise asked unexpectedly. </p>
		<p>Kara looked down, embarrassed. "I'm afraid I'd be more trouble than it's
			worth," she said. "I'm a vegetarian. Most people find it difficult to invite me
			to dinner. "</p>
		<p>"Nonsense. I've got a wonderful vegetable soup that I could whip up. You
			wouldn't mind, would you, Ginny? "</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at Nana for only a second, then shook her head. "No, of course
			not. Please join us. "</p>
		<p>Kara looked from Ginny to Louise and back again. "Okay then, I guess. " </p>
		<p>"Great," Louise said and gave Kara directions to their house. </p>
		<p>Kara left, slowly shaking her head. Why? She wasn?t good with people,
			strangers. Why had she agreed to dinner? Then she grinned. Because you?re a
			sucker for blondes, she told herself. </p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Well, what do you think? " Louise asked Ginny after Kara had left. </p>
		<p>"About what? "</p>
		<p>"About the artist, of course," Louise said. </p>
		<p>"She seemed nice enough, although I don't know why you insisted on inviting
			her to dinner," Ginny said. Something about the woman?s eyes made her
			uncomfortable. Ice blue. For a second, she wondered if they were real. With her
			jet-black hair, she would have expected dark eyes, not the vibrant blue that
			stared back at her. But it was not the dead, lifeless eyes that colored contacts
			produced. No, these eyes were very much alive. </p>
		<p>"I thought you might like her company. " </p>
		<p>"I'm sure I will. She was just . . . " Ginny shrugged. "A little
			intimidating. "</p>
		<p>"Yes. At first, I thought it was her height," Nana said. "But I think it?s
			her eyes. They seem to just look right into you. "</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, her mind drifting back to the dark-haired stranger who had just
			left. </p>
		<p>"Well, anyway, she seems near your age. Maybe you can make a new friend."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Nana, for looking out for me," she said dryly. </p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny. I just wish you had some friends here, is all," she said. </p>
		<p>Ginny let her shoulders sag and she forced a smile. "I know, but I'm fine,
			really. " </p>
		<p>"Are you? I know Phil has been calling, but you never tell me about it. When
			are you going to see him again? " she asked. </p>
		<p>"Actually, he wants to come visit. "Ginny knew it was a mistake the minute
			the words were out of her mouth. Nana?s eyes lit up and Ginny turned away from
			them. </p>
		<p>"That's wonderful, dear. Maybe you two can work out your differences after
			all," she said. "Do you think he?ll come soon? " </p>
		<p>Ginny ignored the question. "So what kind of vegetable soup do you have that
			you can just whip up? " she asked, changing the subject. It was always Phil with
			Nana. </p>
		<p>"Well, there's that soup I make with chicken. I can just leave out the
			chicken," she said with raised eyebrows. "Don't you think that would be okay?"</p>
		<p>Louise left the store early to start dinner and by the time that Ginny had
			arrived, the soup was simmering and Nana was tidying the kitchen. </p>
		<p>"I'm going to take a quick shower," she called. </p>
		<p>"Fine, dear," Louise called back. </p>
		<p>Ginny undressed in her room and slipped a robe over her naked body, grabbing
			underclothes on her way out. She was running late and their guest was expected
			in fifteen minutes. She hurried down the hall to the spare bathroom, hearing
			Nana singing in the kitchen and she smiled. It seemed Nana was looking forward
			to their dinner guest much more than Ginny was. It wasn't that she had taken an
			instant dislike to Kara Morgan or anything. In fact, she seemed quite charming.
			She just hated the idea of Nana finding friends for her. </p>
		<p>She was dismayed to find that the tall woman was already seated on the sofa
			when she walked out of the shower. She gave an embarrassed smile and hurried
			past the door in her robe. Apparently Kara Morgan was timely, something Ginny
			had never been accused of!</p>
		<p>Kara watched her run past, her eyes locked on the tan legs exposed beneath
			her robe. She smiled and turned back to Nana, catching the end of her monologue.
		</p>
		<p>When Ginny finally joined them, Nana was serving wine like an expert hostess
			and Ginny nearly laughed out loud, knowing Nana had never served wine a day in
			her life!</p>
		<p>"Hello. Sorry I'm running late," she said to Kara. </p>
		<p>"No problem. " </p>
		<p>Ginny was again conscious of blue eyes following her across the room and she
			felt an involuntary shiver run down her spine. </p>
		<p>"Kara's from Seattle, too," Louise said to Ginny as she accepted the glass of
			wine from her as if she had done it numerous times before. </p>
		<p>"Really? I'm afraid I don't know anything about your work," Ginny admitted.
		</p>
		<p>"There's not much to know. I'm just an artist, not quite as struggling as I
			used to be," she admitted. </p>
		<p>Ginny sipped her wine, thankful Nana had chosen one of their better bottles
			for the occasion. "Are you familiar with our area? " she asked. </p>
		<p>"No, not at all," Kara said. "I came here for the first time in May and fell
			in love. "Kara let her eyes rest on Ginny?s for a second. "How long have you
			been here? </p>
		<p>"Since last October, although I've spent summers here since I was a child."Ginny glanced at Nana and knew that they were both remembering happier times
			from long ago. </p>
		<p>Kara nodded and an uncomfortable silence filled the room as she wondered why
			she had accepted this dinner invitation. She normally liked being alone while
			she worked, hardly ever making friends along the way. She glanced at Ginny as
			she sipped from her wine and she wondered what this young woman was doing out
			here, alone and so far from Seattle. </p>
		<p>"Ginny surprised me when she said she intended to buy the store and come live
			with me," Louise said, as if reading her thoughts. "Here I thought she was all
			ready to get married. "</p>
		<p>Ginny glanced at Kara and rolled her eyes. "I found out Nana didn't really
			need taking care of," she said. </p>
		<p>"No, but I would love great-grandchildren someday," she said. </p>
		<p>Ginny hoped Nana wouldn't start with that, but it was too late. The seed had
			been planted. </p>
		<p>"Phil is a wonderful man, Kara. Why she left him behind in Seattle, I'll
			never know," she said. </p>
		<p>"Nana!" Ginny exclaimed. </p>
		<p>"Are you married? " Nana asked Kara, dismissing Ginny with a wave of her
			hand. </p>
		<p>"No. Never," Kara said. </p>
		<p>"Never? What are you? Early thirties? "</p>
		<p>"Thirty-four," Kara said. It had been a long time since she had to explain
			about her lack of a husband to anyone. </p>
		<p>"Well, I hope Ginny doesn't wait that long. She's already twenty-eight. Her
			clock is ticking, if you know what I mean," she said. </p>
		<p>"Nana, please," Ginny said quietly. </p>
		<p>"He's a fine man, Ginny. You can't wait around for ever. "She turned
			expectantly to Kara. "Isn't that right? " </p>
		<p>"I wouldn't know about that. I'm not exactly looking for a husband," she said
			lightly, feeling the strain of this conversation with these strangers. </p>
		<p>"No? Are you one of those independent feminists who thinks she doesn't need a
			man in her life? " Nana asked, softening her words with a smile. </p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>A brief smile touched Kara?s lips and drained her wineglass. "I'm just happy
			being alone," she said quietly, feeling no need to explain herself. "I don't
			really need a man to take care of me. "</p>
		<p>Ginny met her eyes, trying to apologize silently and Kara accepted with a
			slight nod before looking away. </p>
		<p>"In my time," Nana continued, "you were married by twenty or you were
			considered an old maid. I know women wait longer these days, but really,
			twenty-eight is long enough," she said. </p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>"Oh, all right. I just want you to be happy. Is that so hard for you to
			accept? "</p>
		<p>"I am happy," Ginny insisted. </p>
		<p>"Bull!You've been moping around here for the last eight months!" </p>
		<p>Ginny let out an exaggerated sigh and raised her hands in defeat. "Shouldn't
			you be checking on dinner? "</p>
		<p>"Very well. I can take a hint. "Nana excused herself with only a slight huff.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," Ginny said. "At her age, Nana just speaks what's on her mind."</p>
		<p>"It's okay. She's not the first to inquire about my marital status," Kara
			said lightly. "So, who's Phil? " she asked, turning the conversation away from
			herself. </p>
		<p>"That's another story, I'm afraid. "</p>
		<p>"Running away? " Kara guessed. </p>
		<p>"You might say that. Only don't tell Nana. She?s convinced Phil and I will be
			married by Christmas. "</p>
		<p>"Your secret's safe with me. "</p>
		<p>"I think I read an article about you in Northwest Magazine," Ginny said,
			again changing the subject. "Well, I skimmed the article," she admitted. </p>
		<p>Kara met her eyes, wondering if Ginny remembered everything about that
			article. It had made no secret that she was a lesbian. </p>
		<p>"I remember something about a mural you painted," Ginny said. </p>
		<p>"In Yakima," Kara supplied. </p>
		<p>"Yes. So, are you famous or what? " Ginny asked lightly. </p>
		<p>"Not really, no. I have a decent following here in Washington and down the
			coast, but I'd hardly call me a household name. I'm surprised that you've
			actually heard of me," she said. </p>
		<p>"I'm not really into the art scene," Ginny apologized. </p>
		<p>"Not very many people are," Kara said. </p>
		<p>"Dinner, you two," Nana called and Kara stood, thankful that the evening was
			nearly over. </p>
		<p>"This looks good," Kara said as she filled her bowl. "I hope you didn't go to
			any trouble. "</p>
		<p>"What trouble? " Nana shrugged. "I just left out the chicken. " </p>
		<p>Ginny met the amused eyes of Kara Morgan across the table and smiled. Nana
			really was a handful, she admitted. Especially when she wanted to be!</p>
		<p>The conversation during dinner was polite, but sparse. Ginny tried her best
			to draw the dark-haired woman out, but most of her questions were responded to
			with one syllables words. She suspected Kara was not much of a talker, but she
			wondered if Nana?s earlier comments had offended her. </p>
		<p>Kara made her escape as soon as she had helped clear the table. "I enjoyed
			dinner," she lied. "But I've got an early day tomorrow. "</p>
		<p>"Oh? Where to this time, Kara? " Nana asked. </p>
		<p>"Lake Wenatchee," she said. </p>
		<p>"It's beautiful out there. Will you paint it? "</p>
		<p>"I'll sketch it first, see how it feels," she said. "It was nice of you to
			invite me out here. Thanks again for dinner. "</p>
		<p>Ginny walked her to the door, feeling a need to apologize. "I hope Nana
			didn't make you uncomfortable," Ginny said quietly. "Or offend you. She didn?t
			mean any harm. "</p>
		<p>"It was fine. I appreciate a meal out now and again," she said, forcing a
			smile. "Maybe I'll see you around. " </p>
		<p>Ginny met her eyes, again astounded by their blueness as they peered into
			hers. "Maybe so. Come by for coffee anytime. " </p>
		<p>"Thanks. I will," Kara said and walked away quickly. She let out a deep sigh
			when she reached the safety of her own truck. She had never been good at social
			events, never been good with strangers. She knew she had only accepted the
			dinner invitation because Ginny Harrison had intrigued her. She laughed at
			herself now. Ginny had a very real boyfriend waiting in Seattle, a boyfriend
			Louise hoped would one day be Ginny's husband. She drove away to the Dobson
			cabin, now hers for the next several months and put the younger woman from her
			mind. </p>
