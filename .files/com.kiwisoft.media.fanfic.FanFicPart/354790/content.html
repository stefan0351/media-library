<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 13 -->

<p>Noticing that Sam was beginning to shiver a little, Brooke stood up and grabbed the blanket she had stashed in the back seat.</p>
		<p>She handed it over. "Here. It's getting a little cold".</p>
		<p>Sam accepted it with a grateful smile. "Thanks". She looked at Brooke. "You okay?"</p>
		<p>"I'm fine", she replied. "I've got my jacket on".</p>
		<p>Despite that, Sam shuffled over and flung the blanket around her shoulders so they were both closely huddled beneath it.</p>
		<p>Sam smiled shyly. "Wouldn't want you catching a cold or anything".</p>
		<p><i>Catch a cold?! More like faint from the heat!</i></p>
		<p>"Thanks", she replied instead, loving every second of it.</p>
		<p>Her mind began to wonder as she brainstormed other possible reasons for Sam to invade her personal space on a more frequent basis.</p>
		<p><i>Ms Glass, Sir, this is a note from my parents informing you of my extremely rare condition. In order for me to survive, it is absolutely imperative that Sam McPherson sits on my lap for the entire class. My life depends on it. </i></p>
		<p>Brooke smiled to herself.</p>
		<p><i>Dad. Mom. I don't know how to tell you this, but Sam has been marked by the Federal U.S. Government for assassination. As her personal body guard, I must be in direct contact with Sam at ALL times.</i></p>
		<p><i>This also means sleeping in her bed.</i></p>
		<p>Brooke grinned. She <i>really </i>liked that scenario.</p>
		<p>"What are you grinning at?" Sam asked, a little disturbed.</p>
		<p>Brooke cleared her throat, and blushed. "Nothing".</p>
		<p>"Right", Sam replied, clearly not believing her. "Brooke?"</p>
		<p>"Yes?" She asked, still not fully paying attention.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry about Alex today".</p>
		<p>Pushing aside her lustful thoughts, Brooke glanced at Sam.</p>
		<p>"Don't be. I mean, his last comment bought up some unpleasant memories but other than that, he had every right to be angry. I wasn't treating him that nicely, and I was giving you a hard time. I'm the one who should be apologizing. I really am sorry Sam. You are the last person I want to hurt, but that's all I seem to be doing lately."</p>
		<p>"You're not entirely to blame Brooke. I gave as good as I got, and I know that some of the things I said to you hurt you deeply. Besides, it's not as if I went out of my way to see what was wrong, even though I wanted too".</p>
		<p>"I was biting your head off most of the time, why would you come near me? Besides, I wouldn't have told you", Brooke admitted.</p>
		<p>"Because you don't trust me," Sam stated, hurting at the thought.</p>
		<p>Brooke shook her head. "It's not that. It was something that I had a little trouble accepting but I'm okay with it now. I promise I won't take my frustrations out on you".</p>
		<p>Sam frowned as a thought came to her. "It's not your eating disorder is it?"</p>
		<p>Brooke was quick to reassure her. "No, it isn't. Believe me".</p>
		<p>"Isn't there anything I can do to help out?" Sam asked, feeling helpless.</p>
		<p>"Just be my friend Sam." Brooke replied, seriously.</p>
		<p>She grinned. "I think I can do that".</p>
		<p>They lapsed into a comfortable silence and Sam wondered if today could get any more weird. It certainly had been a day of revelations, all culminating with a small trip to the mountain where she was huddled under the blanket with Brooke, watching the stars and the bright lights of the surrounding towns.</p>
		<p>What started off as a day from hell was fast becoming a good one. She sneaked a glance at the blonde sitting very closey beside her.</p>
		<p>She smiled.</p>
		<p><i>Definitely a good day. Now if only I can get her to do this more often.</i></p>
		<p>She paused, thinking.</p>
		<p><i>Brooke? Mind if I sleep with you tonight? I have no idea how it happened but my bed mysteriously caught on fire! I can't believe it! Who would do such a thing?!</i></p>
		<p>Sam snickered.</p>
		<p>"What's so funny?" Brooke asked, confused when the brunette beside her started laughing for no reason.</p>
		<p>"Nothing", she replied, trying hard not to blush.</p>
		<p>Brooke just smiled. "Right". She looked up as something caught her eye.</p>
		<p>"Sam, Look! Shooting star! Make a wish!" She cried out excitedly.</p>
		<p>Ever the cynic, Sam laughed. "I don't think so."</p>
		<p>Smiling sadly, Brooke stood up and faced her. Reaching for Sam's hand, she leant forward. "Sometimes, you just need to believe", she whispered into her ear.</p>
		<p>Pulling back slighty, her lips mere inches from Sam's, Brooke gazed at the beautiful face in front of her and smiled.</p>
		<p><i>God, I am so in love with you.</i></p>
		<p>"Make a wish," she whispered again.</p>
		<p>Sam simply nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</p>
		<p><i>I want you to love me back.</i></p>
		<p>"We need to get going", Brooke said after a long moment, not letting go of Sam's hand.</p>
		<p>Sam nodded, but neither one made an effort to move.</p>
		<p>"Brooke?" Sam finally found her voice. "We need to come up here again".</p>
		<p>Brooke gently squeezed her hand and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Definitely".</p>
		<p>They headed home with the radio playing softly in the background.</p>
		<p><i>I'm falling even more in love with you</i></p>
		<p><i>Letting go of all I've held onto</i></p>
		<p><i>I'm standing here until you make me move</i></p>
		<p><i>I'm hanging by a moment here with you</i></p>
