<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 9 -->

<p>The next few weeks were a blur for B'Elanna as she continued her training for the joust, now using her new mount.  Her armour was ready--complete with a reinforced pauldron on the shoulder to her protect her from the lances of her competition and a small cradle mounted on the left elbow to steady the lance as she charged.  She spent several days convincing her new horse to accept the armour he needed to wear to protect his face and chest from errant lances.  In particular she worked for hours at a time coaxing him to accept the chamfron over his face without becoming agitated.  When she practiced with him now, she had Harry try to distract the beast while she charged by leaping out, shouting, or waving a white cloth in the air until she was certain the animal would not react badly in the lists and throw her before the competition even began.  She also rode into town several times to ensure that the noises and smells of crowds would not adversely affect his concentration.  Wherever she went with the animal heads would turn to admire the handsome knight on his powerful mount.  The young maidens were already whispering his name about town and he had yet to even compete.  B'Elanna was well aware of the effect she had on the young women in London, but, although it was flattering, her only thoughts were of Lady Hansart.</p>
<p>An offhanded comment by Annika had prompted B'Elanna to name her new horse Goliath, and indeed she appeared as a diminutive David when she stood beside him, however the bond between them meant that the difference in size was unimportant; he obeyed her slightest command without hesitation.  Indeed, for B'Elanna, the name held a deeper meaning as her quest for glory and riches often led her to feel that she was fighting a much stronger enemy than simply the knights she fought in the lists.  Her battle had become had become a larger one somewhere along the way.  She was fighting against a world in which she would never belong.  She was a woman in a man's world, a peasant in a noble's world and she knew it was the fight of her life.  If she were ever to be happy in this world it was a fight she could not afford to lose.</p>
<p>With only a few days left until they needed to leave for the first tournament of the season B'Elanna was practicing furiously.  Her skills were finely honed and she almost never missed her target.  Goliath's smooth stride made settling the lance into the cradle on her elbow much easier than it had been on the other horse.  She was nervous, as she had never been struck with any great force, although Harry and Tom had done their best with practice lances.  She knew that only the first hit she took in competition would tell her whether or not she would be able to withstand such punishment.  As frightened as she was however she was also looking forward to her first joust.  She knew that Annika's family would be there and she hoped that if she were to become tournament champion that Lady Hansart's father might begin to accept her as a suitable mate for his daughter.  What Annika might think when she found out the truth about Beyla was something B'Elanna put resolutely out of her mind and refused to think about.</p>
<p>The night before they were to leave for the first tournament of the season B'Elanna and Harry lay in front of the fire finishing their dinner and talking.  They were all packed even down to the tent, so they would sleep in the open tonight just as they had when their adventure started.</p>
<p>"Are you nervous," Harry asked B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"Most assuredly.  I can't even begin to conceive of what it will be like to joust against a real knight, and to take my first hit.  What if I'm unhorsed by the first lance I take and I lose Goliath?"</p>
<p>"Maybe you should use one of the other horses until you are more certain of your skills."</p>
<p>"No! If I don't believe in myself absolutely I will never succeed.  I will ride Goliath and trust that I will prevail."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is unwise to tempt fate," Harry said, worried about the possibility of B'Elanna losing the horse she had worked so hard to train.</p>
<p>"Fate would be unwise to tempt me," B'Elanna replied with a grin forcing herself to feel more confident than she was.</p>
<p>"We should get some sleep B'Elanna, we have a long journey tomorrow, and little time to rest before the tournament begins."</p>
<p>"I suppose so," B'Elanna replied.  She rolled over onto her back and pulled her blanket up over herself.  She lay staring at the stars and dreaming of victory in the lists until she fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next day was a long and dusty journey for them and it was after dark when they approached the tournament grounds.  They pitched their tent and stabled their horses before taking a walk around the grounds to find some food.  They ran into many people that they recognized from other tournaments and soon they were drinking ale and feasting with about twenty knights who were all eager for the competition to begin.  B'Elanna felt completely at home in this company and gave as good as she got when it came to the rough teasing the warriors visited upon one another.  Finally the party broke up and B'Elanna and Harry returned to their tent for the night.  B'Elanna fell asleep with a smile on her face feeling once again as though she were in her element now that she was back on tournament grounds.</p>
<p>In the morning they registered and B'Elanna fought several sword fights which she won handily. She was gratified to see that Annika, Tom and Kate were among the spectators, as she hadn't seen them up until this point.  She could make out Tom's voice over the din as he cheered her on to victory.  When she exited the sword lists she removed her helmet and was happy to receive a kiss on the cheek from Annika in honour of her victory.  They spent the afternoon watching some of the other competitions, careful to remain out of sight of Annika's parents.  Finally it was time for Beyla to change into his armour for the joust and Annika and the others left to find a place in the stands from which to watch.  Annika had meant to give Beyla a scarf to wear on his sleeve as a token of her favour for him as a knight, but in the Lord's haste to go and get ready she had not had the chance.  She felt a bit saddened that Beyla would not be jousting in her name, but promised herself that she would rectify that fault at the next match.</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Harry walked toward the arena, Harry was carrying the lance and B'Elanna was leading Goliath, who was dancing nervously at the unfamiliar sights and sounds.  He was sensing B'Elanna's nervousness and appeared to be feeding off of it as well.  Her heart was pounding with both fear and anticipation as she peered at the crowds gathered to witness her match.  She could see Annika sitting with her family near the royal box and was gratified to see that they were sitting alone, at least for now they did not appear to have found a suitor for Annika's hand.</p>
<p>The trumpeters sounded a flourish to notify the crowd that the heralds were about to announce the combatants and Goliath nearly bolted at the sound.  B'Elanna worked furiously to calm him down and eventually she managed to mount up and take the lance from Harry's hand.  Goliath nearly threw her several times as he reared up, dancing on his hind feet, until she soothed him sufficiently to line up for the signal to charge.  When the signal came she dug her heels into her horse's flanks and they were off, she felt his powerful muscles bunch beneath her and she fought for control with one hand while attempting to get the lance into the cradle on her elbow with the other.  She was so focused on her tasks that she barely looked up in time to see the oncoming horse and rider before they were upon her.  She managed to get the lance into the cradle, but the position of her arm was all wrong as she was too busy trying to control her horse to aim properly.  Her lance missed her opponent completely at the same moment that the other knight's lance crashed into her chest with the force of thousand hammers.  She felt the breath forced out of her in a gush and it seemed as if she would never again be able to fill her lungs.  A bright light seemed to explode behind her eyes and for a moment she could not see.  The roar of the crowd mingled with the roar of her blood and filled her ears; she only managed to stay in her saddle by luck.</p>
<p>Goliath returned to the other side of the ring and Harry took his bridle, holding the horse still and desperately trying to see if B'Elanna was still conscious or not.  Eventually she opened the visor on her helmet and managed a small smile in response to Harry's panicked questioning.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, really, it just knocked the wind out me...I wasn't ready for the hit.  I can't control Goliath and aim at the same time...it's too much."  She continued to pant for breath as Harry handed her a water skin and she drank deeply, pouring some of it over her face as well.</p>
<p>The herald was announcing the commencement of the second run and B'Elanna once again lined up for the charge.  This time she kept her head up and tried to get the lance into the cradle without looking down.  Once again her aim was wide and the opposing knight broke his lance on her shoulder without her scoring a blow.  The impact wasn't as great this time and she was more prepared, so the blow glanced off her shoulder and she had no trouble saying in her seat... but the humiliation of her failure was a worse blow to her than any lance could ever have been.</p>
<p>She lost that match and her next one without ever scoring a hit, and so she was out of the jousting competition straight away.  She still had the sword fights to prepare for so she gave Goliath to Harry to take to the stable while she went to her tent to change her armour for the sword fights.  She managed to win all of her matches in the sword ring but that was of little consolation to her; the joust was what mattered and she had no idea how to correct her problems.</p>
<p>After the presentation of awards, B'Elanna was leaving the arena when she was approached by a much older man with a graying beard and a bald head.  He spoke with a northern accent and introduced himself as Ulrich.</p>
<p>"I watched you joust yesterday," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that what you call it?"  She smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"I can help you Lord Beyla, if you'd like."</p>
<p>"Why would you help me."</p>
<p>"Let's just say you remind me of someone I once knew and leave it at that shall we.  Do you want my help or not?"</p>
<p>It was on the tip of her tongue to reject his offer, but there was something about the man that made her trust him and so she merely nodded her acceptance.  He told her to get dressed, saddle her horse and meet him in a field outside of the tournament grounds where the knights sometimes practiced together before the tournament.  She went to the stables and told Harry of her plans and that she would not be attending the banquet tonight...for once he didn't argue with her as he could see her mind was made up.  He merely wished her luck and went off in search of food after helping her secure her armour.</p>
<p>She walked with Goliath over to the practice grounds and found that Ulrich was already there and ready to work.  He wasted no time in beginning his critique of Beyla's jousting abilities.</p>
<p>"To begin with you worry too much about the way you are supposed to joust and not enough about what you are actually doing while you are in the lists.  Forget technique for now, you need to keep your head up, and don't try to rest the lance in the cradle, it is an affectation for nobles too weak to hold their lance in one hand, trust your arm and your strength. Watch the lance all the way into the target." He said while pulling her arm up and showing her how to hold the lance single-handed.</p>
<p>"You've trained your animal well and it knows its task. Let the horse do its job; guide him with your knees and the weight of your body...you should only use the reins if he is out of control...you taught him to trust you, now it is time for you to trust him. Once he is in motion concentrate only on the aiming of your lance."</p>
<p>B'Elanna's head was swimming with the wealth of information Ulrich had imparted in such a short time, but she tried to file it all away nonetheless.  The older knight was already climbing onto his horse and heading to the far end of the practice ground, so B'Elanna mounted and quickly readied herself for the task.</p>
<p>She missed completely again with the first lance, and, although Ulrich was carrying a lance of his own, he made no attempt to strike her with it, content to merely pass by close to her.</p>
<p>He rode up to her shaking his head.</p>
<p>"You are still thinking too much my lord.  This time simply loop the reins over the pommel and guide the horse with your body.  I will not strike you...I believe you've had enough of that for today," he said with a grin.</p>
<p>B'Elanna who felt as if her body was one giant bruise merely smiled at this comment.</p>
<p>"All you need to do is concentrate on hitting me with your lance, nothing else matters," he counseled before galloping back to the other side of the field.</p>
<p>It was several more passes before B'Elanna finally struck Ulrich in the chest with her lance.  She whooped her triumph and was gratified to hear Ulrich do the same.  They practiced for hours until B'Elanna's arm was shaking with the strain of holding the lance.  Finally they did two more passes and this time Ulrich told B'Elanna he was going to strike her.  To her delight she took the hits and still managed to guide the tip of her lance unerringly into the pauldron on Ulrich's shoulder.  The older knight seemed as happy with B'Elanna's success as she was herself and as they rode off to the stables he invited her to come to his tent and share a meal.  They spent the evening telling tales of glory and honour until Ulrich's beautiful wife came and hinted that it was time for the older gentleman to be getting to bed.</p>
<p>B'Elanna returned to her tent and found Harry waiting for her.  He helped her remove the bindings from her chest and rubbed the lineament they used for her aching muscles into her back and shoulders.  While he was working over her body he informed her that Annika had inquired as to where he was and why he did not attend the banquet.  Harry assured her that he had smoothed things over with the Lady and that she had informed him that they would be leaving for the tournament in Sussex the next day. B'Elanna was happy to hear that Annika and her family were intending to attend that tournament as well as it would give her a chance to speak to her Lady once more.</p>
<p>The next day B'Elanna was more stiff and sore than she had ever been in her life, but as they worked at tearing down their camp she gradually loosened up enough to be able to work without pain.  Still it was a relief to be on the road again, and to be able to rest in the saddle of her horse.</p>
<p>Several days later they arrived in Sussex and set up their camp within the confines of the tournament grounds.  B'Elanna was anxious to try her new skills in the ring and she was fairly buzzing with excitement as she went about her preparations.</p>
<p>Annika, on the other hand, was feeling a great deal of anxiety.  She accepted Harry's explanation as to why Beyla had failed to attend the banquet at the last tournament, but she couldn't help but feel that perhaps the young Lord was losing interest in her.  She had seen the flocks of young women who vied for his attention before his battles, and although he had never accepted a token from one of them since she had known him, she was worried that he might soon decide to do so.  She knew that many of the young women sought out the beds of the triumphant knights after a battle and she was worried that Beyla might one day accept such an offer as she had allowed no more than a chaste kiss on the hand from the handsome young knight.  She did not wish to lose the young Lord but was unsure of what to do to keep his interest in her.  She knew that she loved him, and although the church had no official policy on marriage and sex as yet, she knew her father would be furious if he found out.  Part of what he was offering along with money for her dowry was her purity...this seemed to matter to the ancient men he was talking to, as their desire to keep their bloodlines pure was great.</p>
<p>She had no one but Kate to talk to about this and so she approached her handmaiden on the day before the tournament was to begin.  When she explained her predicament to Kate the older woman smiled indulgently.  Frankly she was surprised that the young couple had waited this long to consummate their relationship.  She knew the rules were different somewhat for the upper classes than for the lower, but she also knew that very few woman of any class in this day and age went to their marriage beds chaste.  She knew of several tricks Annika could use to fool her husband into believe she was a virgin on their wedding night, and she shared them with the young woman now.  She advised Lady Hansart to think deeply about what she was contemplating doing, but said that in the end if she wanted to hold the young Lord's attention, a visit to his tent after the banquet was an age-old method of doing so.  Annika was a little shocked at Kate's words; her sheltered upbringing had kept such things from her. She had, however, overheard the whispered conversations of many of the Ladies, single and married, in the viewing stands and knew that the practice of bedding a favoured knight after a day of fighting was not entirely uncommon even among the upper classes.</p>
<p>Annika was determined to speak to Beyla before he entered the lists to joust for the first time in this tournament.  She had tucked a scented scarf in her bosom and she wished for Beyla to wear it on his sleeve as a token of her affection for him.</p>
<p>She had never sought out a knight in the marshalling area before and she was frankly nervous about braving the crowds, but her desire to speak to Beyla was greater than her fear.  She didn't trust Tom not to reveal her secret to her father, so it was only herself and Kate who made their way through the press of bodies toward Beyla and Harry.</p>
<p>Having spotted her friends, Annika found herself overcome with shyness.  She simply stood and watched as the two men worked at preparing Goliath for the joust.  They were just finishing placing the barding over his neck when Beyla looked up and noticed Annika standing nearby.  Annika's heart leapt when she saw the smile that spread over Beyla's face.  In two quick steps Beyla was at her side, taking her hand and pulling her closer.  As happy as they were neither of them could speak for a moment and finally it was Annika who broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla, I have come to wish you well in the tournament."</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled at Annika's obvious nervousness.</p>
<p>"I find I have missed you as well Lady Hansart," she replied bringing Annika's hand to her lips for a lingering kiss.</p>
<p>"I...I have felt your absence quite keenly my Lord," Annika felt silly being so formal with a man she harboured such intimate thoughts about, but her upbringing was difficult to overcome.  She paused for a moment before speaking again.</p>
<p>"I wish to give you something Beyla."</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked expectantly at Annika until the woman, blushing furiously, drew Beyla over to stand next to Goliath in such a way as to shield them from prying eyes.  Looking deeply into Beyla's dark brown eyes for a moment she slowly unbuttoned the top of her bodice and drew out the scarf.</p>
<p>"I thought perhaps you might wear this in my honour today."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was unable to breathe, let alone speak, but she managed to nod her acceptance as Annika tied the scarf around her arm.</p>
<p>"I, uh, thank you."  Beyla stammered.</p>
<p>"Beyla, they are calling the bans for the joust, you need to finish getting ready," said Harry, poking his head under Goliath's neck to find his friend.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll, uh, I'll be right there."</p>
<p>Annika smiled at Beyla's befuddled expression and slowly rebuttoned her bodice before kissing Beyla's cheek and whispering in his ear.</p>
<p>"Good luck my Lord,"</p>
<p>B'Elanna could only stare at Annika's retreating figure until Harry grabbed her arm and urged her back to the task at hand.</p>
<p>Finally she was ready and standing in the lists.  The crowd was huge, but as ever she could pick out Annika's white blonde hair easily in the crowd.  Her hand went unconsciously to the scarf tied around her arm.  She knew that many women gave such favours to a different knight daily, but her instincts told her Annika would not do such a thing lightly.  This was a declaration, B'Elanna was certain of it.  Unbidden her mind wandered back to the image of Annika unbuttoning her bodice.  Her heart constricted and her stomach felt as if it had fallen to her feet.  She had never experienced such intense emotions before...just thinking about the beautiful young woman left her breathless.</p>
<p>"Beyla, if you don't get your head into this fight you are going to lose it," Harry chided as he placed her helmet over her head and began to fasten it tightly.</p>
<p>"You're right, I'm here...I'm ready."</p>
<p>Beyla vaulted into the saddle and grabbed her lance.  Goliath danced to the starting point and B'Elanna prepared for her charge.  She snapped the visor of her helmet into place and when the signal came she dug her heels into Goliath's flanks and they surged forward.  Remembering Ulrich's advice she let Goliath have his head and leaned toward the centre rail as she lowered the lance, steadying it with her right arm only, never taking her eyes off the target.</p>
<p>Goliath followed her motion perfectly, tracking closely along the centre rail.  B'Elanna focussed only on the chest of her opponent, not his lance, and as they closed with one another she leaned forward and thrust her lance forward with a snarl, feeling a surge of triumph as she felt it shatter against the other knight's shoulder.  The force of her blow knocked her opponent off balance and his lance missed her entirely.  For the first time she led a jousting match!</p>
<p>She raised her shattered lance in triumph as she rode back to Harry, tossing it aside and grasping her new one, now totally focussed on the joust.</p>
<p>She won all of her events that day and was enthusiastically looking forward to seeing Annika that night to talk over the events of both the morning and the afternoon.</p>
<p>However, it was not to be.  As luck would have it Annika's father had found a prospective suitor for her that morning and insisted that Annika have dinner with the family and the nobleman he was considering for her marriage.  Annika was in agony as her father and the older gentleman droned on about land and business throughout dinner and long into the night.  She only managed to get a moment alone with Kate to ask her to send a message to Beyla telling him only that she would see him tomorrow at the banquet and that she was happy for his success today.  It was cold comfort indeed as she pictured her knight celebrating his victory without her.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was disappointed when Kate delivered her message, but her mood was so good that she simply assumed that Annika's parents were about and that she couldn't slip away.  She quickly forgot her disappointment as she and Harry went to a local tavern for their meal and got caught up in a group of competitors who spent the night drinking and swapping tales with them.</p>
<p>The next day B'Elanna won several more jousts before being retired, but she was happy with her performance.  Each time she tilted she felt a little stronger and a little more confident.  She was certain that before long she would be tournament champion.  She performed as always in the sword matches and handily beat all comers both on foot and on horse.  She was certain she had the love of Lady Hansart and her pockets were growing heavy with her winnings.  Life could not have been better for her.</p>
<p>She took special care with her dress that night, causing Harry to shake his head at her unusually fastidious attention to detail, and then she left for the banquet.</p>
<p>To Annika's great relief neither her parents nor her prospective suitor were attending the banquet that night and she was allowed to attend with only Kate for company.  She was gratified to see that Lord Beyla continued to wear her token on his sleeve as he entered the hall.  She made her way to his side and they spent the evening dancing and talking together until the banquet ended.</p>
<p>Not wishing for Kate to know of her plans Annika said goodnight to Beyla and went home with her handmaiden.  She said goodnight to her parents before pretending to retire for the night.  In reality she waited only as long as she felt was necessary to ensure the household was asleep before she placed a veil over her head and slipped out into the night.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had had a bit to drink that night, and she was feeling an overwhelming sense of happiness as she wandered through the tents on her way back to their camp.  The dance music from the banquet was still echoing in her head and she hummed softly, dancing a few steps as she wove her way home.  When she reached the tent she was surprised to find that Harry was not there.  She was unable to remove the bindings from her chest without his help so she poured herself a cup of water and wandered around her section of the tent looking at the prizes she had won and the things she had accumulated since she had become Lord Beyla.  It was amazing to her how much had changed in such a short period of time.  She undid the scarf from around her arm and buried her nose in it, closing her eyes and drinking in the sweet scent of Lady Hansart.</p>
<p>So preoccupied was she with her contemplations that she didn't even notice the curtains to her room parting and the Lady herself enter her quarters.  It was only when Annika made a small sound that Beyla started and turned to see Lady Hansart removing a veil from her beautiful face.</p>
<p>"Lady Hansart... Annika, what are you doing here?"  B'Elanna's heart was pounding both with fear and with excitement at the sight of her love.</p>
<p>"Kate tells me that when you wish a man to know how you feel about him words are often insufficient but actions may suffice.  I...I wish for you to know how I feel about you." She blurted the words out quickly afraid if she did not she would never have the courage to speak them.</p>
<p>"Kate told you this?" B'Elanna asked as she found Annika somehow in her arms.</p>
<p>"Yes," was all Annika said as she raised her lips to Beyla's cheek.</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt soft lips brush her cheek and then seek out her mouth in a gentle kiss.  Her heart was pounding as she pulled Annika closer and returned the kiss with increasing pressure.  They stood thus for several moments until Beyla came to her senses and moved Annika gently away.</p>
<p>"We cannot...."</p>
<p>"You do not desire me." It was a flat and inflectionless statement and Annika's liquid blue eyes were filled with pain as she said it.</p>
<p>"I assure you I do, but your honour my Lady.  I hold it in the highest regard."</p>
<p>"Honour means nothing without love.  I value not my honour if I have not your heart Beyla," said Annika as she once again pressed her lips to B'Elanna's.</p>
<p>B'Elanna could feel the blood roaring in her veins, drowning out all thought and reason.  She returned Annika's kiss, gasping as she felt the younger woman's hands moving over her shoulders and pulling her close.  She allowed herself to deepen the kiss, gently begging entrance to Annika's mouth with her tongue.  A request that was eagerly granted.  Feeling weak in the knees, B'Elanna moved them to the bed, where they sank down together, drowning in one another's embrace.</p>
<p>Annika, emboldened by her success thus far, was also feeling the effects of their passionate kisses.  She longed to explore Beyla's body with her hands and to touch his skin as she could feel his finely muscled body moving beside hers.  Beyla's hand was tracing along her side, brushing the gentle swell of her breast.  This elicited a gasp of pleasure, and B'Elanna began to trace the contours of Annika's neck with her lips, as she began to undo the fastenings of Annika's dress to allow her access to silky white skin.</p>
<p>Annika reached out and allowed her hand to feel the muscles flexing in Beyla's leg, her head swimming with desire she moved her hand up his leg slowly until she reached....</p>
<p>B'Elanna was so engrossed in Annika's body that she failed to notice what the younger woman was doing with her hands until it was too late.  She felt Annika press against the juncture of her legs and although the feeling caused her to groan with desire the rational part of her mind knew that this was serious trouble.</p>
<p>Annika sprang back in horror at her discovery, stumbling in her haste to get away from Beyla.  Her mind was refusing to accept what she now knew to be true.</p>
<p>"You... you are a woman.... But, this cannot be.  How...how could you do this to me? Every word from your mouth has been a lie," she cried wiping furiously at her lips with her hand, as if she would erase every trace of Beyla from mouth.</p>
<p>"No," B'Elanna cried in an agony of fear, "I never lied to you Annika, I love you, I swear it."</p>
<p>"Do not speak to me of love...you cannot possibly have any conception of the word."</p>
<p>"I do love you Annika and you love me also.... I know you do or you wouldn't have come here tonight."</p>
<p>"This cannot be love; it is an aberration. It is wrong."</p>
<p>"How can our loving each other be wrong and your father's attempts to sell you to the highest bidder with the proper last name be right.  Tell me Annika, is that your idea of love?"  B'Elanna's heart was in her throat as she desperately sought the words to explain the inexplicable.  She knew what she wanted and she tried desperately one more time to convince Annika.</p>
<p>"Break with them and come with me..."</p>
<p>"I cannot abandon my family."</p>
<p>"But they can abandon you to the servitude of a loveless marriage! They don't love you Annika or they wouldn't be doing this to you.  You were strong enough to come here, be strong enough to take the next step.  We can have a life together you and I...I know we can.  Have a little faith in me...in us. I beg you!"</p>
<p>"You've broken faith with God himself, how then can you ask such a thing of me?"  Spat Annika, turning to leave.  B'Elanna hurried after her.</p>
<p>"Wait, I beg you!"</p>
<p>Annika stopped, but did not turn around. The set of her shoulders told B'Elanna that further protests would be futile. Accepting this she asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Will you tell them about me?"</p>
<p>"No Beyla, I will keep your secret and you will stay away from me and my family." Her voice was low and broken and she again moved off into the night.</p>
<p>B'Elanna made as if to follow once more but Harry, who had arrived back at the tent in time to hear the last part of their argument, grabbed her arm and stopped her.</p>
<p>"Let her go B'Elanna, you will only do more damage if you pursue her."  Harry was terrified at the thought that Annika now knew about B'Elanna's secret.  He thought for a moment before speaking.  "Perhaps we should leave this place.  We could go back to France and live there. It is not safe for you here now that your secret is out."</p>
<p>"She will keep her secret, she gave her word."</p>
<p>"If she does not the crows will pick your body clean as you hang from the gibbet."</p>
<p>"She loves me Harry, I know it; she will not allow harm to come to me."</p>
<p>"If you are wrong you will pay with your life."</p>
<p>"I know her Harry, she will keep her word."  B'Elanna sank to her knees and for the first time in her life felt completely defeated.</p>
