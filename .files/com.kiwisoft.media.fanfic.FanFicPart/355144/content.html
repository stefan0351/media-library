<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Nineteen -->

<p>The name of the game for the day was flag football. The teams ended up with Sam, Brooke, and Lily as members of one and Nicole, Mary Cherry, and Carmen as members of the others. Needless to say, Carmen was not a happy camper.</p>
<p>The game progressed somewhat peacefully with Sam's team leading 14-3 when Nicole hatched her devious plan.</p>
<p>"I've had enough of Brookie's attitude, Mary Cherry. I think it's time we knocked some sense back into her," she whispered to Mary Cherry. Mary Cherry nodded with an equally evil smile.</p>
<p>On the next play, Sam passed the ball to Lily who took off running for the end zone. Nicole and Mary Cherry made a beeline for Brooke, both hitting her squarely in the chest as they ran. She let out a `whoomph' of air on contact and fell flat onto her back, striking her head as she hit. She lay dazed and unmoving as Nicole stood a few feet away, laughing evilly.</p>
<p>"Did that snap you back to your senses?" she chuckled. A cry of rage startled Nicole as Sam slammed into her from behind. Sam pummeled Nicole for several seconds, finally shoving the petite blonde's face into the mud before moving to check on Brooke. She left Nicole sputtering to clear the mud from her nose and mouth as she rushed to Brooke's side.</p>
<p>"Are you fucking insane, Nicole? Jesus," Sam swore. Brooke groaned and tried to open her eyes. They were glassy and unfocused.</p>
<p>"Brooke? Brooke, are you OK?" Sam whispered worriedly. She stroked at Brooke's blonde hair as she spoke. Brooke's hazel eyes fluttered and then focused on Sam.</p>
<p>"Head hurts, Sammy," she complained quietly. Sam felt fear race through her like a lightening bolt.</p>
<p>"OK, just lay still. We'll get you to the hospital," Sam assured her. Tears were starting to run from Brooke's eyes. Sam wiped them away gently.</p>
<p>"Sshhh, don't cry. You'll be OK. I'm right here," Sam soothed.</p>
<p>"Hurts," Brooke mumbled. "Scared."</p>
<p>"I know, baby, I know. So am I. But you're OK. You know who you are and you know who I am, right?" she joked lightly. She was relieved to see Brooke's eyes sparkle at her slightly.</p>
<p>"My Sammy," Brooke whispered for only Sam to hear. Sam leaned down so that her mouth was beside Brooke's ear.</p>
<p>"Always."</p>
<p>"Shit, Sam, is she OK?" Lily asked as she approached the duo.</p>
<p>"She's hurt. She hit her head when she fell. She needs a doctor," Sam explained quickly. Lily nodded.</p>
<p>"Done," she said, taking off to call an ambulance while Carmen read Nicole and Mary Cherry the riot act in the background. Sam blocked the tirade out and centered all her attention on the fallen blonde.</p>
<p>"Help will be here soon. You just relax and focus on me, Brooke. You're going to be fine," Sam's voice was soft and honeyed, soothing Brooke with its low timber and quiet strength. She let it wash over her and calm her nerves a bit. Sam watched as some of Brooke's fear seemed to fade.</p>
<p>"Feeling any better?" she asked as Brooke gave her a small smile.</p>
<p>"Much, thanks. I think I can get up now," Brooke declared. Sam's gentle hands on her shoulders prevented the action.</p>
<p>"Please just lay still," the concerned tone of Sam's voice and the worried look in her eyes stilled Brooke's movements.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>"Ambulance is on the way, Sam," Lily said as she returned. "And the teacher is sending Nicole and Mary Cherry directly to the principal. They're in it BIG."</p>
<p>"Good. Ass holes," Sam swore as she stroked Brooke's cheek. Brooke sighed and closed her eyes against the pain in her head.</p>
<p>"Hey, no naps on company time," Sam chided jokingly. Brooke opened her eyes with a slight giggle.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Sam. My head really hurts," she explained. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"You did hit pretty hard. So you just take it easy until we get you checked out. I want to be on the safe side, you know?"</p>
<p>"I know, Sammy. You always take such good care of me," Brooke whispered with a wide smile. Sam blushed.</p>
<p>"Helps here, Sam," Lily called.</p>
<p>"OK, baby, let's get you checked out and then take you home," Sam said.</p>
<p>"You'll stay with me, right?" Brooke asked, her fear returning a bit.</p>
<p>"Of course. I'm not going anywhere," Sam promised.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You are one lucky young lady," Dr. Claremont, Brooke's neurologist announced. "All your tests are normal. Aside from an understandable headache, Brooke, you're fine. Not even a concussion."</p>
<p>Brooke sat up on the exam table and let out a sigh of relief that was echoed by Sam in a nearby chair.</p>
<p>"So I'm OK?" she asked just make sure. Claremont nodded.</p>
<p>"Right as rain."</p>
<p>"Thank God you've got a thick head," Sam snickered. Brooke mock glared at her.</p>
<p>"Shut up you," Brooke ordered with a grin. Claremont smiled at them. When they'd arrived in the emergency room, Sam was beside herself with worry and Brooke was scared stiff that she was going to have to restart again. He was glad that that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>"Your memory from the accident to present is clear and intact," Claremont continued. "Unfortunately, your prior memories are still missing."</p>
<p>"Fortunately, unfortunately," Brooke shrugged. "Depends on your point of view."</p>
<p>"I suppose," Claremont said hesitantly. "I do have a few things I'd like to discuss with you Brooke, since I have you here."</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke asked with a roll of her eyes. She wasn't in the mood for questions. She just wanted to go home.</p>
<p>"How are the mood swings?" Claremont asked. Brooke looked at her feet and shrugged one shoulder.</p>
<p>"Fine," she said shortly, unwilling to elaborate.</p>
<p>"All right. Nightmares?" he asked. Brooke shook her head. "Migraines?"</p>
<p>"Not as bad or as often," she said impatiently. She looked back up at the doctor with one pale brow arched. "What's with the third degree? Do you have a point?" Sam winced. She hated how defensive and angry Brooke got when anyone tried to talk to her about her condition.</p>
<p>"Brooke," Claremont started patiently. "To properly heal, a patient has to have the right mindset, the right attitude. And quite frankly, you don't. You're hostile and angry as well as unwilling to even approach the subject of regaining your memories."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't care whether or not they return. It's no big deal," Brooke explained.</p>
<p>"But, Brooke, it is. You suffered a traumatic event. An accident that changed the very basis of who you are. You woke up with no knowledge of yourself or anyone around you?" Claremont continued.</p>
<p>"And I've adapted," Brooke snapped.</p>
<p>"Yes, you have but not without difficulties. And you have to be prepared for the possibility that your memories will return because if they do, everything will change again. And you're not prepared for that."</p>
<p>"I think I want to go home now," Brooke announced, crossing her arms across her chest defiantly. Claremont sighed and glanced at Sam who shrugged.</p>
<p>"OK, Brooke. If you're not willing to talk, I can't make you. I'll release you but at the FIRST sign of any trouble, I want you back here ASAP," he ordered. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"No gym for the foreseeable future or any other sort of strenuous activity. Keep taking your meds as prescribed. I don't see the need to add anything else."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke mumbled as she headed for the door. Sam shot the doctor a sympathetic look.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she said as Claremont nodded at her.</p>
