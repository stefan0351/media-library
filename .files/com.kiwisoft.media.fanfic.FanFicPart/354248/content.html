<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Thirteen: Myths and fairytales -->

<P>Seven heard a pounding, it was louder than the drum and she focused on the
new beat. It was steady and familiar and she pictured B’Elanna as she struggled
to move toward the sound. Her body felt light and it was so tempting to float
away, but the pounding beckoned her. She felt herself growing heavier and she
was cold, but there was something warm and soft under her. She leaned into the
warmth and breathed deeply.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven mumbled. She wanted nothing more than to go to sleep.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna said. She rubbed Seven’s back and began to sob. "I’m
right here. Come back to me, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven grumbled and wiggled closer to her wife’s warm body. She was
beginning to feel the cold air on her back.</P>
<P>"Right here, love." B’Elanna sat up, pulling Seven with her. She kissed her
temple and smiled at Nara who was looking on.</P>
<P>"Cold," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>Nara grabbed another fur and wrapped it around both women. "You all right?"
she asked B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I am now," the Klingon answered without looking up. Tach came running up to
them moments later.</P>
<P>"You’re late, as usual, Tach." Nara turned and gave her husband a shake of
her head. "Go see to your son."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna insisted on holding Seven even after tricorder scans proved that she
was all right, but Seven certainly didn’t mind. Tach took care of Ty while Nara
helped Seven and B’Elanna get dressed. They went back to the cabin, the entire
group remaining quiet on the short journey.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Back at the cabin, B’Elanna was in full mother hen mode, a strange Klingon
version, but recognizable as mother henning. She insisted that Seven go
immediately to bed and brought her a thin broth and hot tea, then sat beside her
and helped the embarrassed former Borg eat.</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven said as B’Elanna tucked her in for the third time.</P>
<P>"You almost died," B’Elanna said, choking on the words. "Damn it, just let me
take care of you for a while." She fidgeted with the blankets needing something
to keep her hands busy.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven said gently. "It is more probable that I was simply in a
deep hypnotic state and appeared to be in danger." </P>
<P>"Rest," B’Elanna ordered.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," Seven said, mimicking her wife’s favorite snide response and
then sighed and leaned back to grudgingly allow B’Elanna to move the furs up
around her neck as if she were a child. In truth Seven was uncertain what had
happened. She had experienced something, but whether it had been a hallucination
induced by the heat, a creation of her own subconscious expectations, or
something else, she was not certain. The idea that it was more than her own mind
creating complex archetypes was most disturbing to ponder. It made her entire
existence as a Borg, focused on the rational, provable sciences seem faulty.
Even though she had no desire to rejoin the collective, she found its
consistency and infallible logic comforting and didn’t like the idea of that
being turned upside down.</P>
<P>"Seven?" After still more fidgeting with Seven blankets B’Elanna finally
seemed happy with the placement of the furs and then held her wife’s fingers and
rubbed her thumb over the back the pale hand.</P>
<P>"Yes, Lana?" Seven studied her hand in B’Elanna’s, finding the contrast
compelling. She loved B’Elanna’s small hands, dark like coffee, the way they
were strong enough for any task, yet capable of incredible tenderness and
dexterity. Seven’s own hands were larger, the color more like cream, but they
had their own range of strength and gentleness.</P>
<P>"I need you to make me a promise," B’Elanna said after a few moments. Her
voice was quiet, barely a whisper, and her hands began to tremble.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven shifted her weight and sat up, but kept her one hand in
B’Elanna’s which meant that she had to manage the maneuver one handed while not
letting the furs slip down so that B’Elanna wouldn’t begin fussing again.</P>
<P>"Promise me you will never put me through this again." She saw Seven raise an
eyebrow in silent question. "First with the bear, now this…" B’Elanna explained.
"Seven, I can’t handle this again. Please promise me you won’t ever put yourself
in danger again."</P>
<P>Seven paused, then sighed and looked up. "I cannot make that promise."</P>
<P>"Please," B’Elanna asked, squeezing her wife’s hand.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I can promise you that I will not take any unnecessary risks, but
I will not make you a promise that I might have to break. Do not ask that of
me." Seven eased her hand out of B’Elanna’s and rubbed her forehead with both
hands. "We both know there are times when we must do dangerous things. I cannot
lie to you and say that I will not."</P>
<P>"All right," B’Elanna whispered after a moment. "Just be careful, and no more
ritual sweats… unless absolutely necessary."</P>
<P>"Agreed." Seven smiled, recognizing the attempt at humor. "But if I am forced
to go back into the sweathouse, next time I am ignoring the drum," she added
almost to herself.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna sat up and gaped at her wife. "What drum?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled and shook her head. "Nothing, a myth I read about somewhere. It
involved the drum of Kahless."</P>
<P>"You heard it? And you tried to follow it?" B’Elanna felt her skin erupt into
goosebumps.</P>
<P>"You are familiar with the legend?" Seven smiled, still demising the
vision.</P>
<P>"Seven, I was told to go back for you because you were being beckoned by
Kahless."</P>
<P>"Told?" Seven wasn’t yet ready to believe in any mystical revelations.</P>
<P>"In the sweat house…I had a vision. I was warned that you were in danger,
then I woke up and you were…were…" </P>
<P>"Did you see Kahless as well?" Seven asked, thinking that everyone must see
similar self-induced hypnotic images.</P>
<P>"You saw Kahless?" B’Elanna demanded. "You saw Kahless, and heard his drum,
and I got stuck with my mother?" She and paced the small room, channeling her
fear into misplaced indignation. "You’re not even Klingon."</P>
<P>"Well, he was rather unremarkable," Seven offered. "He was rotund and his
teeth were not nearly as nice as yours are." She hoped to placate her wife,
realizing that she perhaps shouldn’t have volunteered so much information.</P>
<P>"Unremarkable? Geeze, Seven, you didn’t tell Him that did you?" B’Elanna
asked as she spun back toward the bed. She studied her wife. "You did!"</P>
<P>"He seemed to appreciate my honesty," Seven said defensively. "Besides, it is
not as if it was the Real Kahless…if there even is a real Kahless. He was merely
a manifestation of my subconscious expectations," she explained. "Although I
found my other selves annoying in the extreme. As I left they were still
exchanging insults."</P>
<P>"Selves?" B’Elanna sat back down next to the bed. "What else did you
see?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven proceed to explain the entire vision and B’Elanna listened quietly,
although she did cringe when Seven repeated her insults about the greatest
Klingon warrior who had ever lived. Afterwards, B’Elanna grew very quiet before
explaining her own quest imagery. Seven found it most intriguing that they had
similar themes of self-acceptance, but dismissed it as what they both
subconsciously wanted to hear. B’Elanna wasn’t so easily persuaded. When she
brought up the drum, and her knowledge of Seven’s danger, the exBorg was
stymied, then suggested that perhaps B’Elanna had felt her pulse slowing while
the were holding hands. Still, B’Elanna leaned toward a spiritual
explanation.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Nara and Tach were thrilled with the revelations the sweat ritual provided,
though Tach didn’t want them to try it again anytime soon. He had been more
frightened than he cared to admit when he saw Seven’s limp body, and was
grateful to find her conscious when he returned. With the debt to Kahless paid,
they went about their daily routine with a new sense of purpose and belonging.
Both B’Elanna and Seven secretly believed that their arrival on the planet was
by far the greatest gift they had received.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Time passed more quickly than anyone had anticipated, and soon the day for
Tach and Nara’s sentence to end drew near. Seven found herself spending more
time with Ty. The bright boy enjoyed every minute of it as he did the time with
his beloved "Ba," as he called the Klingon. "Ba" had been his first word, which
was no surprise to Nara who had been watching her tiny son fall in love with the
rough, gruff, and surprisingly loving woman.</P>
<P>Tach and Nara were out taking a walk and Seven was cooking lunch. She heard
the muted pounding at the back of the cabin followed by a very distinctive,
demanding voice. </P>
<P>"Ba!" The pounding continued. "Ba! In… Ba in now."</P>
<P>Seven smiled and quietly walked toward her bedroom to see the tiny Narian boy
at the door using a one of his father’s extra boots as a makeshift battering ram
on the bedroom door. As expected, the door opened and B’Elanna grabbed the boy,
who squealed his mock fear.</P>
<P>"All right you little rat, now that you’ve got me, what are you gonna’ do
with me?" the Klingon asked as she picked him up over her head.</P>
<P>"Bear." Ty growled and pointed toward the giant bed that dominated the
room.</P>
<P>"Don’t you ever get tired of that story?" B’Elanna kissed his head. In truth,
she never tired of telling that particular tale. She carried Ty over by the bed
and put him on the floor. He sat on his tiny butt and wiggled from side to side
as B’Elanna yanked the giant fur off of the bed and wrapped it around her body.
It was the fur from the bear that had attacked Seven so long ago, she had tanned
the hide and it had adorned her bed soon after. The Klingon began growling and
crawling around the room, which might have been menacing except that the huge
fur dwarfed the caramel skinned warrior, leaving half of its length dragging
behind her. B’Elanna treasured the skin, it not only represented the first day
she revealed her growing feelings to her wife, but it had covered the two women
every night since they had first made love.</P>
<P>Seven stood quietly in the doorway, mesmerized my her spouse and the boy she
had grown to love with all her heart. She kept the door mostly closed so she
wouldn’t disturb the scene forming in front of her.</P>
<P>"The huge, evil bear moved through the forest looking for something…or
<I>someone</I> to eat," B’Elanna said in a deep voice. She paused to look at Ty
and snarled, but instead of scaring him, it sent him into a series of delighted
giggles. "There weren’t any little boys, so the bear sat and wished for some
lunch to come to him." B’Elanna peeked under the bed, licking her lips and
smacking her lips.</P>
<P>"Evan!" Ty offered as a suggestion to the bear in front of him. He hadn’t
quite mastered "S"s yet, and that was his version of the former Borg’s name.</P>
<P>"Hmmm," said the bear. "I think I hear something." B’Elanna laughed evilly
and crouched down under the fur. "What’s this? Here comes my lunch, and she
looks tasty."</P>
<P>Ty wiggled and scooted closer.</P>
<P>"Well," B’Elanna told Ty as she stepped back into the narrator voice. "Along
came a beautiful princess, who wasn’t looking where she was going." Of Course
the narrator wasn’t looking at the bedroom door, and was oblivious to the
"princess" witnessing the tale. </P>
<P>"The princess walked right up and sat not ten feet away from the bear and
started picking berries," B’Elanna explained, although Ty knew the story well.
"Then…" B’Elanna paused, gathering up the fur around her. "Grrrrrrrrrahh!" she
snarled as she pounced on the imaginary princess. "He tried to gobble her up,
but the princess was stronger than she looked and she punched the Bear.
Grrrrrrrrrrr." B’Elanna fell over and rolled onto her back in a mock
struggle.</P>
<P>Ty laughed and decided to assist by leaping onto B’Elanna and wrestling with
her for a few moments before she lifted him off.</P>
<P>"Then the princess escaped," B’Elanna said, "and the bear was furious." To
illustrate she howled and stomped in circles. "Then, the princess found a great
warrior who healed her wounds and went in search of the evil bear."</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty provided.</P>
<P>"Yes, it was the great warrior, Ba," she continued. "Ba searched everywhere
for the bear." B’Elanna proved the point by looking under the bed, behind the
pillows, and even lifted Ty up to check under his butt. "Finally the great
warrior found the vicious bear…" B’Elanna said, the story building to a grand
climax in typical Klingon form.</P>
<P>"And," Seven said as she burst into the room. "The "<I>Great warrior</I>"
found the savage bear…taking a <I>Nap</I> next to the lake," Seven said as she
crept over to the two dark haired playmates.</P>
<P>Ty giggled even more now that he had both of his favorite aunts with him.
B’Elanna, however, frowned and glared at the exdrone who was taking the glory
out of the tale.</P>
<P>Seven continued, her voice serious, "And the "<I>Great warrior</I>" snuck up
on the bear and killed him while he slept." Seven pounced onto B’Elanna and
pinned her to the floor with the fur trapping her inside it. Ty of course helped
by jumping onto Seven’s back. The three rolled around until Ba signaled her
defeat.</P>
<P>"All right, I’m dead already," came the muffled surrender from inside the
fur.</P>
