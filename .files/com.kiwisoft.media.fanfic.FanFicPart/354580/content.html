<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 10 -->

<p>The next morning the two slayers woke to the sound of the door being pounded
on. Buffy grumbled loudly and untangled herself from Faith's arms so she
could answer it. She thought it might be Missy and that she had forgotten
her key otherwise she wouldn't have even bothered to get up. Buffy was more
than a little surprised when she opened the door to find Cordelia standing
there. "Cordelia," Buffy said surprised. "What are you doing here? And so
early in the morning…" Buffy pointed out, sounding slightly annoyed even
though it was already noon.</p>

<p>"Yeah, isn't that bad for your pores or something?" Faith asked grumpily
from the bed and Cordelia noticed her for the first time.</p>

<p>Cordelia's eyes went wide in surprise as she saw Faith for the first time
and she shot Buffy a questionable look. "I knew you liked bad boy's but what
the hell is Faith doing in your bed?"</p>

<p>"Not that it should matter to you, but she's good now and she's my
girlfriend. Now why are you here?" Buffy stepped aside allowing Cordelia
entrance into the room for the first time and the ex cheerleader sat on the
other bed.</p>

<p>"First off, eww. Secondly, I needed a break from the LA scene. Angel's still
all broody and it started to depress me. So anyways I thought I'd come back
here and see you all. Xander told me to come find you since his girlfriend
was intent on having more orgasms," Cordelia shook her head in disgust at
the thought.</p>

<p>"So, are we supposed to entertain you or something?" Faith asked jokingly.</p>

<p>"Well it would be a start," Cordelia told her arrogantly.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head but smiled. She knew Cordy was trying to sound like a
bitch because that was her method of protection. It was a sort of
self-defense thing. "I've got classes all day." She gave Faith a quick kiss,
not really caring what Cordelia's reaction might be. "You can keep her
entertained while I'm gone," Buffy told her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"You want her to keep me busy? Hello, last time I saw her she wanted to kill
us and now I'm supposed to spend time with her?"</p>

<p>"I've got a better idea. Missy can entertain Queen C and I'll sleep."</p>

<p>Missy chose then to walk into her dorm room and she caught the end of
Faith's sentence. "Who am I entertaining?" she asked as she noticed the girl
sitting on her bed. Cordy did a double take when she saw the brunette
walking into the room.</p>

<p>"I'm not seeing things am I? Because there's two Faith's in here and that's
kind of creepy. "</p>

<p>"This is my roommate Missy, and yes she does look exactly like Faith. Why
don't you two try getting along and tonight we'll all have a sleepover at
mom's or something since she's got another auction." Buffy grabbed some
clothes and went into the bathroom to change.</p>

<p>"Hey Missy, what to do you say to spending the day with the ice queen here?
I think you two would get along good, and then I'd get to sleep." Faith
smiled and positioned herself more comfortably in Buffy's bed.</p>

<p>"Well what do we have in common then o wise one?" Missy asked jokingly as
she sat down on her bed next to Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Other than B, you're both the only ones with enough balls to speak your
mind to me and not be afraid of me kicking your ass for it."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well I know you're still afraid of my spatula of death."  Faith and
Missy both broke out into laughter at that. Even though Missy didn't know
what she was talking about, the phrase 'spatula of death' was still funny.
If nothing else it eased the tension in the room considerably.</p>

<p>"So what time is it?" Missy asked. When she woke up alone in Willow's dorm
room she felt incredibly awkward and rushed out of there without even
noticing the time. Cordy informed her that it was almost noon and she was
surprised that she managed to sleep that late.</p>

<p>Buffy came back into to the room and grabbed her books. "So are you all
going to be able to play nice today?" All three nodded at her and she gave
Faith another kiss. "I'll tell Willow that we're having a sleepover when I
see her. Be at my mom's at five," Buffy said with a sweet smile. "Faith and
Cordelia both know the way so if you stick with one of them you'll be able
to get there," she said to Missy. "If you want to come and all that is."</p>

<p>After that Buffy made her way out of the door for class. "So are you ever
going to get up or what?" Cordelia asked. Faith's grin grew, and she
actually thought about getting up but Buffy would actually kill her if she
did that now.</p>

<p>"I don't think you want me to C. Unlike B, I sleep in the buff. So unless
you wanna see my goodies…" Cordelia held up her hand and Faith stopped
talking.</p>

<p>"So you wanna get out of here and do something? I figure I can keep you
company and you could show me around town since I haven't gotten familiar
with it yet."</p>

<p>"Deal," Cordy said with a smile. "Be good Faith."</p>

<p>Faith just grinned at them as they walked out. She was glad she wouldn't be
there interfering with them. Of course now, she had to reconsider her
position on Missy and Willow being a cute couple. Suddenly Cordelia seemed
so much more appropriate.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some hours later Cordelia and Missy were walking around the mall, actually
enjoying each other's company. "You're actually from LA?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but we moved senior year and then I ended up here," Missy told her.</p>

<p>"How can you move from LA to here? Are you insane?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," Missy grinned at her. "But I wanted to get away from all that
stuff. After last year I just wanted to slow things down a bit and come to
someplace small. You don't ever miss it here?" she asked as they went into
another store.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't miss this place. I miss some of the people but Sunnydale
itself sucks," Cordy spotted a shirt she liked and held it up to her. "What
do you think?"</p>

<p>"It's nice if you're going for the 'I'm a total slut' look," Missy said with
a laugh as she looked through some other clothes. "And Sunnydale isn't so
bad. It's got some weird stuff going on but it's a lot less stressful being
here than it was at home. The only thing I really miss is cheerleading."</p>

<p>"You were a cheerleader?" Missy nodded her confirmation and Cordy grinned at
her. "I guess Faith was right, we do have a lot in common."</p>

<hr>

<p>Faith was walking around the UC Sunnydale campus trying to figure out to do
for the next hour. Buffy had said to meet at her mom's at five, but Faith
knew the blonde was probably already over there setting things up. She just
didn't want to seem over eager, but then when did she start caring about
that stuff? She grinned to herself and set off on her way to see her
girlfriend. Besides, if she got there early, they might be able to have a
little fun before everyone came.</p>

<p>"I…I'm s-sorry," Faith heard a girl stutter from behind her. She spun around
and saw a blonde girl looking up at some beefstick and he was looking down
at her angrily. "I d-didn't mean to," she said softly.</p>

<p>"You better not ever do it again. It's not like you're blind," the guy said
and Faith noticed the girl looked a little scared. The guy gave her one last
glare and walked away. Faith didn't know why, but she felt like she should
make sure the girl was okay.</p>

<p>"Hey," she said softly as she approached the girl. "Everything five by
five?"</p>

<p>The girl looked at her and smiled weakly. "W-what's five b-by five?" she
asked softly.</p>

<p>Faith grinned even bigger at that. "You know, everything okay here? I saw
that guy being an ass so I just wanted to make sure you were okay."</p>

<p>The girl's smile grew at Faith's concern and she nodded. "I'm just new here
a-and people are being a l-little mean so far."</p>

<p>"Then you need to find the fun," Faith stated. "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Tara," the shy blonde said as she held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Faith," the slayer replied as she shook her hand. "Come on, we're having a
girl's night over at my girlfriend's house.  You can hang with us if you
want. It'll be fun," Faith offered with her best smile. It wasn't usually
her thing to be that nice, but it was obvious the girl needed a few friends.</p>

<p>"I…I shouldn't I-impose on y-you like that."</p>

<p>"Nah, come on blondie. I'll show you that everyone around here isn't mean."
Faith gave Tara a reassuring smile and the two started walking towards
Buffy's house.</p>

<p>"What if they g-get mad?"</p>

<p>"They won't, just relax." Tara nodded, and did as Faith said. She could tell
the girl wasn't lying and she figured since her first few days on campus
were so bad she had nothing to loose.</p>

<p>"So we're going to y-your girlfriend's house?" Tara asked, making sure she
had heard right.</p>

<p>"Yeah. You don't mind that sort of thing do you?" Faith asked and Tara just
smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Not at all," she said. Maybe she had found the right group of people to be
friends with finally.</p>

<hr>

<p>"So how come Cordelia's back all of the sudden?" Willow asked as she helped
Buffy carry a few groceries into the house.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Buffy sighed. "She said she just needed to get away from
Angel brooding all the time. I think it might have something to do with
Xander though. I wonder how she felt about seeing him with Anya this
morning," Buffy said.  Just as she set the groceries down the doorbell rang
and Willow went to get it while she put the stuff away.</p>

<p>"Hey Faith," Willow greeted her as she let Faith and the other girl in.</p>

<p>"Oh, Red this is Tara," Faith said pointing to the blonde.</p>

<p>"H-hi," the shy blonde said softly as she looked at Willow.</p>

<p>"Oh, where's B?" Faith asked and her face lit up at the thought of seeing
her girlfriend. Willow pointed to the kitchen and Faith took off, leaving
Willow and Tara alone.</p>

<p>"M-maybe I should go," Tara said, feeling a little uncomfortable with the
situation.</p>

<p>"No," Willow said quickly. "I mean, if you don't have anything else to do
you should stay here. It never hurts to make new friends right? We might be
a little weird but we're fun people and yeah," Willow stopped once she
realized she was starting to babble. Tara, like most anyone who met Willow
found the babble cute and she once again relaxed. "You should meet Buffy,"
Willow said and then she realized that Tara still didn't even know her name.
"And my name's Willow. Faith just likes to give people nicknames a lot."</p>

<p>Willow and Tara walked into the kitchen and saw Faith and Buffy sharing a
very intense kiss. Both girls blushed and finally Willow cleared her throat
to get their attention. "Buffy this is Tara."</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy said with a smile. She didn't get the chance to say anything
else though because Missy and Cordelia walked into the kitchen laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't you people knock?" Faith asked them.</p>

<p>"Why? It's not like we're vamp-" Cordelia stopped when she noticed the new
girl in the room. "We brought movies," she said, changing the subject.</p>

<hr>

<p>The six of them spent the next few hours watching the movies that Cordy and
Missy brought. Tara still seemed very shy around the group of friends but
eventually they all realized she's just a shy person all together. But then
Faith had an idea about how to get her, along with the rest of the gang a
little more loosened up. As the last credits on the movie played she shut
off the tv and smiled at the group. "Okay guys, it's game time," Faith said
with a wicked grin.</p>

<p>"Oh, can we play Pictionary?" Willow asked excitedly but Faith just laughed.</p>

<p>"That's not fun enough. We'll play truth or dare," Faith said. Willow looked
at her a little skeptically along with a few others but eventually they all
agreed. After they all got comfortable on the floor they began the game.
Buffy, Cordelia and Tara had their turns, and so far everyone had picked
truth.</p>

<p>Finally it was Faith's turn to ask and she eyed them all carefully and
finally settled on her look-alike. "Truth or dare Missy?"</p>

<p>Missy studied Faith's eyes for a minute and she could tell that she was up
to something. Of course Missy wasn't the type to back down from a challenge.
"Dare," she answered.</p>

<p>Faith's grin grew and she glanced at Willow. "I dare you to kiss Red."</p>

<p>Everyone in the room looked at Faith like she was crazy. "Just because you
and Buffy are gay doesn't mean we are," Missy told her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and Oz. He's my boyfriend and that would be cheating," Cordelia
nodded furiously when she said that remembering when Willow and Xander
cheated on her. "Cheating is bad. Wrong even," Willow added and Buffy put
her hand on the red head's back to calm her down.</p>

<p>"Fine, I'll change the dare," Faith said. "Missy, I dare you to kiss Queen
C," she laughed as she said that. Missy glared at her but she still wasn't
going to back down from Faith's bet.</p>

<p>"Sorry about this Cordy," Missy said quickly.</p>

<p>Before the girl could even respond to what Missy said she felt soft lips on
hers. Much to her surprise she felt herself responding to Missy's kiss.
Everyone watched the two of them with wide eyes until they finally broke
apart. Cordelia looked at them as if nothing had just happened and Missy
smirked. "Satisfied now?" she asked Faith.</p>

<p>"Not really," Faith replied but Missy knew she was from the look on her
face.</p>

<p>"Thanks for inviting me over but I have to get back to campus now," Tara
said after the group recovered from the two girls kissing.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you have to go?" Faith asked their new friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah. But thanks for inviting me over. It was nice meeting all of you," she
said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well I'll walk you back to campus," Willow offered and she stood as well.</p>

<p>"Oh, well you don't have to. I know my way, I think," Tara admitted shyly.</p>

<p>"Really, I'll go with you," Willow said a little forcefully. "It's not safe
to walk around here by yourself at night and I don't mind." Tara finally
agreed and after a chorus of 'be careful's' the two left to make their way
back to campus.</p>

<p>"So who's sleeping where tonight?" Cordelia finally asked.</p>

<p>"Well obviously me and Faith are sleeping in my room. You two can stay in
the guest room if you want, unless one of you really wants to sleep in my
mom's bed," Buffy joked. Missy and Cordy both crumpled their faces up and
shook their heads no. "So then we'll go up there and get the room ready for
you all and you two can do whatever," Buffy said making sure to say the
whatever in a suggestive manner.</p>

<p>Both girls knew Buffy and Faith were most likely going up there to make out
some more so they sat on the couch in an awkward silence. Finally Missy
snapped out of her thoughts and looked at Cordelia. "Why did you respond to
my kiss?"</p>

<p>Cordelia looked at her, not even phased by the question. "It happened by
instinct. Usually when someone kisses you, that's what you do," she said in
a 'duh' type of voice.</p>

<p>"But you're straight right?" Missy asked.</p>

<p>"Of course. Aren't you?" Cordy quipped.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I can't say that kiss wasn't enjoyable," Missy confessed.</p>

<p>"Wanna try it again?" Cordy asked, with a bit of a dare in her voice. Missy
shrugged, acting like she didn't really care but when she looked into
Cordelia's eyes she figured 'why not?' and smiled. Both girls met in the
middle and kissed again, this time however it was a very cautious kiss. It
didn't last long, and when they broke apart Missy smiled at her.</p>

<p>"How long are you in town for?" Missy asked, remaining close to her new
friend.</p>

<p>"Just the weekend," Cordelia replied.</p>

<p>"Wanna make the most of it?" Missy challenged, and Cordy nodded. Without
saying anything else to each other they kissed again, not as shy as before.
Little did they know Buffy and Faith were just outside of the living room
watching them.</p>
