<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 12 -->

<p>Because of the length of time between the next two tournaments B'Elanna only missed one competition before she was ready to get back in the ring.  Whatever the medicines the healer had given her had been they had worked quickly, and aside from another in a growing collection of scars B'Elanna felt none the worse for wear after a few weeks.  She had been careful to continue her exercises and had rebuilt almost all of the strength in her left arm by the time she was ready to pick up sword and lance in earnest once more.</p>
<p>Harry had convinced her to stay away from the tournaments altogether during her recuperation and so it had been several long weeks since she had laid eyes on Lady Hansart.  As they rode in procession with the other knights into the arena she could not stop her eyes from hungrily searching the crowds lining the street for any sign of the beautiful young woman, but to no avail.  It wasn't until she was lined up with the competitors for the opening ceremonies that she caught her first glimpse of white blonde hair in the viewing stands.  Her heart leapt at the sight of perfection only to fall to her feet as she saw Charles Kotay sitting beside her.  A bargain must have been struck for the Lord to still be sitting with her family and B'Elanna felt physically ill at the thought of what that meant for Annika, and for herself.</p>
<p>She barely noticed anything that happened for the rest of the ceremony and as she went about readying herself for competition she felt a lump in her throat and had to fight back tears of pain such as she would never shed over a physical injury.  This was far worse than the blow of a lance or the sting of a sword as it cut into flesh?this was her heart being torn asunder by forces she could never hope to control.</p>
<p>When she entered the sword lists she felt herself unable to care about the competition.  She heard the chanting of the crowd and saw the women and children as they waved frantically to get even the slightest bit of attention from a knight, someone they looked up to and admired, but she couldn't bring herself to feel anything but an overwhelming lethargic sorrow.  Her competitor sensed a chance for victory and attacked with vigour, B'Elanna defended herself but not well and it looked as if she was about to lose her first match. She could hear Harry screaming at her to be careful and she knew he didn't care whether she won or lost but only that she not be hurt in the process.  She had to do something and stop behaving like a spoiled child that has been denied a treat.  She called upon every ounce of character and strength at her command and returned to the fight with renewed attention.  Finally she managed to win back the points and defeat her opponent, much to the delight of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" Harry's anxious visage greeted her the moment she exited the lists.</p>
<p>"I'm fine Harry, I just had a bit of trouble getting my head into the match for a moment."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you came back too soon?we should withdraw and take some more time for your wounds to heal."  Harry tried again knowing that her lack of concentration in the lists had nothing to do with her shoulder.</p>
<p>"I fear there is no cure for the wounds I carry.  We stay."</p>
<p>Harry nodded solemnly knowing the topic was not open for discussion.  He helped her to loosen her armour so that the wait for the next match would not be so uncomfortable, and then they leaned up against the wooden enclosure surrounding the sword ring and watched as the other knights competed in their matches.  B'Elanna found her mind drifting again and she could not even find her old pleasures in watching a well fought match, or pursue her old habits of looking for weaknesses in potential competitors?she was reduced to mourning for love she never really had.  In this situation she found herself falling back on her old friend anger.   She was angry at herself for not being truthful with Annika earlier, and she was angry with Annika for not realizing that the love they shared was more important than what society may or may not think of their morals.  She was angry with Lord Hansart for marrying his daughter off to anyone willing to pay the price and she was angry with Annika for not being strong enough to defy her parents and fight for their love.  None of these things were particularly well thought out, but she welcomed the heat of anger as it replaced the cold harshness of the pain that surrounded her heart. The set of her jaw grew stronger and she felt the warm flood of anger race through her veins, feeding on her strength and shutting out the pain.  She could not wait to reenter the lists and fight again.</p>
<p>When she finally did reenter the ring she fought with a fury and skill that left her competitors breathless and the crowds crying for more. She could not walk two steps through the crowds without being surrounded by women who were vying for her attention as a lover or for boys who clamoured for the attention of a hero.  In another situation it might have gone to her head but as things stood she was unfailingly courteous and always took time to play at battle with the young lads and to gallantly refuse the attentions of the young women.  She was tournament champion again and yet again it meant nothing to her beyond the money and power it brought to her and Harry.  She had more horses now than she could ever hope to use and enough money to live quite comfortably somewhere for quite some time.  The problem was that there was nowhere to go?she had no desire to lead a life of leisure and without a way to earn land from the King there was no hope of finding a quiet spot to live out her life with Harry.  She had never lived in a city and she had no desire to do so now.  Frankly the more success she achieved the less she felt like she fit anywhere in the world, and without Annika and her love she was lonelier than she had ever been.  She even missed the company of Kate and Tom whom she had not seen since Annika had left her tent that fateful night.  </p>
<p>Instead of attending the banquet that night B'Elanna made her way into the woods to the enclave of pagans that Mary had told her about.  She found that she was interested in their views on the world and that she found some solace in the contemplation of the ancient gods and goddesses of the wild.  She could forget her pain for moments at a time in this manner and she was eternally grateful for the respite.  She returned to the tournament grounds long after midnight feeling refreshed and able to face the next tournament in somewhat better spirits.</p>
<p>It was two longs days of travel before they arrived at the next tournament grounds and another day before they were set up in their camp.  Finally when she had a moments free time B'Elanna decided to take her customary stroll around the grounds to see who was here and to hear what news she could of her competition.  She was dressed in a simple burgundy tunic and cloak as she walked around the grounds, nodding to friends and acquaintances.  She stopped to talk with some of the men she knew well from having seen them so often this season.  </p>
<p>She was deep in thought as she rounded the corner of one of the few permanent buildings on the grounds, and so didn't see the person coming around the building from the other direction.  She nearly knocked the young woman over and had to reach out and take the woman into her arms to stop her from falling.  She steadied the woman on her feet and stepped back abruptly upon realizing who it was she held in her arms.</p>
<p>"Lady Hansart?Annika?are you alright?"</p>
<p>Annika seemed unable to speak and sagged back against the wall for support.  B'Elanna was worried now and leapt forward, talking Annika's hands in her own she crouched lower until she was looking up into Annika's downcast eyes.</p>
<p>"Speak to me Annika, are you injured?how can I help you?"  B'Elanna's heart was pounding at the nearness of the beautiful young woman and her hands were trembling to be holding those of her love once again.</p>
<p>Annika recovered her senses all at once and pulled her hands from B'Elanna's as if they had been burnt.  She pushed B'Elanna away from her,</p>
<p>"Get away from me or I will call my father's men and have you taken away."</p>
<p>B'Elanna bristled at her words, "your father's men are no match for me Annika, you'll have to do better than that if you want me to leave."</p>
<p>"Get away from me you?you?you are an abomination in the eyes of God and I want nothing to do with you?I hate you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna grew angry at Annika's deliberately cruel words?she knew Annika was lying to protect herself and yet the words cut deeply into her soul.  She took a menacing step forward, taking Annika's upper arm in her hand and pulling her closer.  When she could speak her voice was harsh.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Lady Hansart, look me in the eyes and tell me that you don't love me the way that I love you?that your heart doesn't race the moment we see one another, that your blood doesn't sing like fire in your veins when our eyes meet.  Tell me that when we part it isn't like dying a small death until we see one another again?You can't because I know you feel it just as I do!"</p>
<p>"Tell me your heart doesn't leap out of your chest the moment our hands touch when we dance, and that you can barely breathe whenever we are near one another."</p>
<p>B'Elanna caught sight of the ragged end of the leather thong around Annika's neck and slowly drew the ring up out of her bodice, leaning her body in closer she whispered. "Tell me you didn't try a hundred times to throw this away only to be unable to part with it because it reminds you of me, because it is all you have left of me when I am not near."</p>
<p>Holding the ring in her hand she leaned into Annika's body?her voice low, almost a purr she went on.</p>
<p>"Tell me that the hair on your neck and arms doesn't stand on its end when you are near me?that you are not aware of where I am every moment that we are in a room together.  Tell me you don't tremble at the slightest touch of our hands?that I don't fill your waking thoughts from dawn to dusk, and your dreams after that?as you do mine.  Tell me you never think of that night, and wonder what might have happened had you stayed.  Tell me you don't love me and I will go."</p>
<p>Tears were streaming down Annika's face, "I cannot."</p>
<p>B'Elanna grinned in triumph; "you do love me."</p>
<p>"But I cannot, I will not.  It is against God."</p>
<p>"Do you think God would really create such a love only to have us deny it?  I would renounce heaven and spend eternity in hell to be with you Annika."</p>
<p>"No, I won't You must go."</p>
<p>"Why, because that would be easier for you wouldn't it?  If I were to leave you could marry Kotay and pretend that a part of your soul doesn't die just a little bit every time he touches you, pretend that when you close your eyes to kiss him it isn't my face and my lips you imagine.  Well I won't do it Annika; I won't make it easier for you to hide yourself away and live a quiet unhappy little life when I know you and I could have so much more together."</p>
<p>"But we cannot, we cannot marry, the law?"</p>
<p>"And what is the law to me? The law forbids me to joust and yet I am champion at almost every tournament I enter.  We love each other and that is a law that I hold sacred above all.  Take my hand and come with me now. We can make our own rules and live together as we see fit.  You'll never want for anything and no one will ever love you as I do. You can be so much more than society will allow if only you take this chance."</p>
<p>"I cannot deny my love any longer Beyla." Tears were in her eyes as she finally gave in to the desires she had been fighting since discovering B'Elanna's secret.  She allowed herself to lean into B'Elanna's embrace and moved her head up to finally claim the lips for which she had been longing for so long now.</p>
<p>Just as their lips met Charles Kotay came around the corner with a group of his friends and caught his promised bride in the arms of another man.</p>
<p>"You?filthy strumpet!" He roared as his brain finally interpreted the signals his eyes were sending it. </p>
<p>"How dare you give your favours to another man.  You belong to me?You are mine, bought and paid for."</p>
<p>He advanced menacingly toward Annika, his face twisted and red with fury.  B'Elanna was unarmed but still she stood between Annika and Lord Kotay, instinctively protecting the woman she loved from harm.  Kotay was angrier at his embarrassment in front of his peers than he was at any betrayal by Annika.  He had no feelings for the woman, but he felt he had been cheated in his dealings with Lord Hansart.  Frankly if he'd been alone he would have cut the young knight's throat and had the woman flogged in public for her sins and he would have been well within his rights to do so.  But since his friends were watching he couldn't bring himself to cut down an unarmed man?it would have been ignoble to do so and his image in the eyes of others was important to him.  </p>
<p>"You worthless woman?you can be sure that you will live to regret dishonouring me.  Be grateful I don't cancel my bargain with your father as no other man would have you after this disgusting display?and as to you?you insolent young pup," he said turning his fury onto B'Elanna.  </p>
<p>"I'll have my satisfaction from you in the sword ring," he spat furiously and slapped B'Elanna soundly across the face.</p>
<p>"I will happily answer all challenges with the tip of my sword," B'Elanna growled heedless of the fact that while she was unarmed Kotay's hand rested on the hilt of his longsword.</p>
<p>"So be it," Kotay hissed and headed toward the shield tree by the registrar's table.</p>
<p>B'Elanna followed along behind him, still holding onto Annika's hand.  On the way they ran into Harry who joined the growing mob of people gathering to watch this altercation.</p>
<p>The shield tree was hung with various shields depicting the events in which the knights could chose to compete.  They indicated their intent to compete by striking the shield showing their desired event with a wooden stick kept handy for that purpose.  Also hung on the tree were two shields that indicated the degree of competition.  They were mostly hung for posterity's sake, as all events in tournaments were generally a plaisance? or for pleasure.  The shield to indicate that an event was to be held a outrance or to the death was also hung on the tree, but it was hardly ever touched.  </p>
<p>Kotay walked up to the shield tree and grasping the wooden stick he struck first the shield to indicate the sword on foot competition, and then he angrily struck the shield of war?indicating his desire to duel B'Elanna to the death.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna this is madness, you must walk away," Harry pleaded with her as she approached the tree.    B'Elanna stared at the shield of death hanging in front of her, still faintly swaying from the force of Kotay's blow.  She reached over and pulled Harry's short sword from its sheath and with a yell swung so fiercely that the shield was torn from its moorings and thrown several feet away to lie in the mud.</p>
<p>"I will meet you in the sword ring in one hour Kotay," she snarled.</p>
<p>She returned to her tent and changed into clothing that would allow her to move more freely in the ring.  She strapped on her long sword, and, having no need of armour for this type of duel she was finished with her preparations.  Kate and Tom had come to take the tearful Lady Hansart away from B'Elanna so that the young Lord could concentrate on his preparations for the duel.  Annika would watch the fate of her life be decided from a distance so as not to distract Beyla.</p>
<p>"Stop this B'Elanna.  He is a seasoned soldier; he fought in the war in France, he'll tear you apart.  You'll be killed?there's no point to this, you can't marry the girl even if you win. You aren't Lord Beyla, you're B'Elanna Torrance and fighting Kotay for Annika won't change that fact."</p>
<p>"When I'm with her I am Lord Beyla, I know you don't understand Harry but this is the way it has to be."</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned and headed toward the sword ring where a crowd was already gathering to watch the death match.  Harry grabbed her arm.  "Cease this madness B'Elanna I'm begging you.  Why risk your life over a woman you can never really have?  Let us go you and I, far from here and begin again, Paris perhaps.  B'Elanna I'm begging you please."</p>
<p>"You may as well ask me to stop breathing as ask me to stop loving Annika.  You ask me why I'm doing this--because I can do nothing else.  It doesn't matter anymore whether I can marry her or be with her or not, all that matters is that I love her and I'll fight to the death to defend her honour and save her from a marriage she doesn't want.  I can' t explain this Harry, it simply is, she is a part of me and I cannot live without her, so I put myself to the hazard and if I die so be it.  I love her Harry, don't ask me to walk away from that."</p>
<p>Harry hung his head, defeated.</p>
<p>"If it should go ill for you Beyla I will act as your second and see try to see justice served."</p>
<p>"No Harry, it ends with me.  If I should die I'm trusting to you to keep Annika safe, take her far from here and see to it that she is free and happy.  Swear to me Harry that you will do this thing for me."</p>
<p>Harry looked deeply into the eyes of the friend that he had loved more than he loved even himself and said, "I swear it will be done My Lord."   </p>
<p>They regarded each other for a moment before grabbing one another in a fierce hug.  "I love you my friend," Beyla said as she turned and entered the ring.</p>
