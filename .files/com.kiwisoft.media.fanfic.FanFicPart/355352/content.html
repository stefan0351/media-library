<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Prom -->

<p>Brooke and Sam met up with the rest of the gang outside the
prom. The plan was that other than Josh and Lily, no one really had dates, they
were going as a group. The only other person with an official `date' was Mary
Cherry who brought some GQ model reject named Brock although Sam kept calling
him Brick. They met up outside and entered together into the school gym, which
was decorated in greens and whites. The theme of the prom this year was In the
Still of the Night. </p>
<p>They sat at their table and watched their classmates mingle
with one another and listened to Nicole's fashion critique: </p>
<p>"Oh, God, who let her out of the house in that?" </p>
<p>"I haven't seen that much skin since the nude beaches in
France. And as much hair too." </p>
<p>"Argh! I'm blind!" </p>
<p>Everyone laughed because 9 times out of 10, Nic's opinion was
spot on. A horrible number of their classmates had bad taste and chose this
night in particular to flaunt it. Everyone cringed as April Tuna approached
their table clad in a salmon colored dress. </p>
<p>"Sam McPherson, Brooke McQueen, glad to see you didn't let the
sophomoric and anthropoid regulations of the facist oppressors prevent you from
attending," she said. </p>
<p>"Uh, thanks, April. I think," Sam said as she looked at Brooke
and shrugged. </p>
<p>"The Sapphic sisterhood seems to be the chic thing these
days," April continued. "I was thinking about giving it a try. Hello Carmen
Ferrera," she added as she walked away. Carmen looked suitably disturbed as Sam
turned to Brooke. </p>
<p>"Well, that's almost enough to scare me straight again," she
joked dryly. Brooke pinched her lightly although she saw Sam's point.
</p>
<p>"Anyone have any mace?" Carmen asked no one in particular. </p>
<p>"Are you two gay?" Brock asked Brooke and Sam. </p>
<p>"He's quick, for a brick," Sam said to Brooke who giggled.
Brooke turned back to Brock. </p>
<p>"Yes, why, does that bother you?" she asked. Brock smiled and
shook his head. </p>
<p>"No, my sister is too. I was just surprised," he said kindly.
Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"I think he's too smart for Mary Cherry," Sam whispered.
Brooke nudged her to shut up. </p>
<p>They ate their dinner of prime rib, or in Lily's case a nice
hearty salad, in compatable company with light conversation, everyone just
enjoying everyone else's company. Even if certain people didn't want to admit to
enjoying other peoples company (i.e.-Nic and anyone other than Brooke and MC).
Soon the dancing started. Brooke and Sam danced together, ignoring some stares
they got as well as one warning from the class advisor. They explained that they
arrived dateless and could dance with whom they pleased and the administrator
had no real argument for that. </p>
<p>They danced to: `Everywhere' by Michelle Branch; `Let Me Blow
Your Mind' by Eve and Gwen Stephani, which drew a few stares because it got a
little suggestive between them; `Short Skirt/Long Jacket' by Cake; `Valentine'
by Martina McBride; `Fallin'' by Alicia Keys and a whole slew of others before
sitting down when their feet finally began to hurt. </p>
<p>"Having a good time, Princess?" Sam asked. Brooke grinned at
her. </p>
<p>"The best," she answered. "You're a terrific date, Sammy." Sam
smiled back at her. </p>
<p>"Why thank you. I'm glad you're having fun, love. I'm glad we
decided to come." Brooke's eyes got wide. </p>
<p>"Really?" Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup, really. This is MUCH better than last year. Especially
given the obvious lack of speeding cars and ambulances," Sam joked. Brooke just
shook her head as she chuckled. </p>
<p>"I told you so," she pointed out. </p>
<p>"Yes, you did. And I'm glad I listened. Thank you, Brooke, I'm
having a wonderful time as well." Brooke leaned over and hugged Sam tightly to
her. </p>
<p>"I am SO glad to hear that, Sammy. You just made my entire
night." </p>
<p>"Good then, I'm doing my job," Sam told her gently. Brooke
just looked at her in amazement. </p>
<p>"You are so amazing, you know that?" Brooke asked. Sam
blushed. </p>
<p>"That's what you tell me from time to time," she responded
with a wry smile. "So are you." </p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to announce this years Prom
King and Queen," the DJ announced as Nicole climbed on stage. </p>
<p>"OK, twinkies, listen up," she started. "The votes are in.
This years Prom King is?Josh Ford!" she announced. Everyone applauded although
no one was surprised. Josh blushed and climbed on stage to be crowned.
</p>
<p>"Uh, thanks," he said. Nicole nudged him out of her spotlight. </p>
<p>"And this years Prom Queen is?" Sam turned to Brooke.
</p>
<p>"You ready?" she asked as she brushed a lock of blonde hair
from Brooke's face. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh," she responded to Sam as she grasped Sam's warm hand. </p>
<p>"Lily Esposito?" Nicole exclaimed as she read the results.
"Are you people insane?" Brooke and Sam started laughing as Lily sat in shock
and Nicole fumed onstage. </p>
<p>"Lily, you'd better get going," Brooke encouraged. Lily stared
at her blankly. </p>
<p>"Huh?" she said numbly. </p>
<p>"It's your night, Lil, get going so that they can crown you,"
Brooke explained to the stunned Latina. </p>
<p>"But you?" Lily started. </p>
<p>"Voted for you. It's OK, Lily, go," Brooke assured her. Lily
smiled and stood up on unsteady legs and joined her husband onstage where she
was crowned as Prom Queen even as Nicole protested and demanded a recount. </p>
<p>"You OK with this?" Sam asked Brooke. </p>
<p>"Better than OK, Sammy. Free," she said simply as she leaned
back in Sam's arms. Sam frowned at her. </p>
<p>"Free?" </p>
<p>"Free from the popular trappings. Look, school's almost over
and what good is popularity going to do me after it? I don't need it; I don't
need another crown. I only need you, Sam. Let Lily have this, I have more than
enough." Sam hugged her. </p>
<p>"You, love, are amazing," Sam told her reverently. Brooke
smiled cheekily. </p>
<p>"I know." </p>
