<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 23 -->

<p>The three women's tear-fest was interrupted by a heavy knock on the
door. </p>

<p>"Who is it?" Willow asked a little more abruptly than she meant. </p>

<p>"It is time to go, Sorceress." a deep voice answered from the other side
of the door. "I had hoped you were expecting me, the moon is rising." </p>

<p>"Sorry." Willow said sheepishly, realizing how harsh she'd sounded. "I
hadn't noticed the time." </p>

<p>"That's quite all right, my child." the priest returned, feeling an
affinity for this young, powerful, yet gracious witch he'd only just
recently met. "A certain nervous anxiety is to be expected on such a
momentous occasion." </p>

<p>Her two attendants helped her on with her cloak and fastened it at the
throat with the pentagram fastener. </p>

<p>The priest handed her the staff she'd received from Teach Tu Dannan.
Then, while the two other women placed and secured a crown of Holly and
Black Oak leaves on the soon to be joined woman's head, the priest
intoned an ancient blessing. </p>

<p>"Now shall we proceed." the older man said and led the way out the door.
"You will be blindfolded before we enter the sacred grounds. I hope this
is not a problem." </p>

<p>"Of course not." Willow stated. "I've done my homework." </p>

<p>That brought a smile to the priest's lips as he handed her a strand of
rope that hung from his belt. </p>

<p>The priest and the two attending witches each took up a torch that had
been placed outside the cabin and lit them from a small fire at the
beginning of the path that led through the woods to the clearing where
the ceremony was to be held. </p>

<p>As she was led through the dense woods by her escorts Willow began to
hear a deep resonant chanting, in an ancient language she'd never heard
before, that grew louder with every step they took. There was also the
sound of drums and if her senses weren't fooling her someone was playing
a flute. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before the witch could tell by the sounds and the feel of
the atmosphere that her party had reached the clearing. </p>

<p>Her blindfold was removed and she found herself standing at one end of
an aisle formed by people in either grey Druid robes or the black and
silver robes of Willow's friends' coven. Each was holding a flaming
torch. </p>

<p>Willow hesitated for a moment in awe of the spectacle she beheld.
Looking around she noticed the scene took on an even more surrealistic
appearance as a thick white fog rose from the ground surrounding the
clearing. She looked to the priest that had escorted her to the area. </p>

<p>"Your destiny awaits Sorceress." the man said, softly indicating that
she should proceed down the aisle. "Go forth and join with your
beloved." </p>

<p>Willow took the candle offered her by the priest, who then took his
place with the others forming the aisle. She walked slowly down the
aisle hearing the gasps as many of those gathered were seeing her for
the first in the green velvet silver trimmed gown and cloak given her by
Brigit. </p>

<p>As she reached the center of the clearing Willow set her eyes on her
lover and as always was breathless at the sight, but this time more than
normal. </p>

<p>Buffy too was wearing the clothing given her by the Morrigan, but the
sight of her lover in the leather tunic, short dark blue skirt and knee
high leather boots set the young witch's blood on fire. </p>

<p>Buffy also wore a crown of Holly and Black Oak leaves but, unlike Willow
who wore her hair loose letting the flaming waves cascade to her
shoulders, the Slayer wore her blonde locks pulled back into a french
braid that hung down her back. </p>

<p>Thoughts of ravaging the blonde beauty filled the red head's mind and
reading her lover's thoughts Buffy favored her with a dazzling smile
that told the hormonal young woman that they both were feeling the same
thing. </p>

<p>Continuing her walk toward the altar where her lover waited Willow
noticed the two coven members that stood beside the Slayer. Remembering
her time with the two women that were accompanying her, she felt a
momentary twinge of jealousy knowing that they had touched her Slayer as
intimately as Kati and Timmra had touched her. </p>

<p>The feeling was gone almost as quickly as it came but not quick enough
that the Slayer didn't notice her lover's feelings and gave her
Sorceress a disapproving frown that fleetingly crossed her features. </p>

<p>Willow felt a small pang of guilt at her momentary lack of trust in her
soulmate and quickly mouthed an apology to her slightly hurt partner,
who once again gave her that all forgiving adoring smile that was
reserved only for Willow. </p>

<p>As the witch approached the altar the priests and witches holding the
torches filed in after her forming a circle around the altar and the
wedding party. </p>

<p>When Willow reached her lover's side, Buffy leaned over and lightly
kissed her beloved's lips then side by side they turned to face the
altar. </p>

<p>A frail looking old priest in a heavily decorated robe, leaning heavily
on his intricately carved staff, stepped up to the opposite side of the
altar from the couple and their sponsors. </p>

<p>He nodded to a younger man in a pure white robe. The young priest held a
large sword up and began walking around the outside of the circle. </p>

<p>On his first trip around all was silent. On the second trip he stopped
at the compass points as the priest or witch that stood there called
that corner. That's when the first strange event of the night happened. </p>

<p>The young priest's first stop was at the Northern point and as the
priest that was there called for the guardian of the element of earth, a
huge white wolf stepped out of the thick impenetrable fog and went
directly to the north point where he sat and, with his tongue hanging
out in a canine smile, looked expectantly at the old priest. </p>

<p>The old man smiled and was heard to say "Welcome Icerunner." then
indicated for the young, obviously frightened, priest to continue. </p>

<p>At the East corner a grey wolf came out of the fog and, when seated, was
greeted as Dawnchaser the guardian of Air. </p>

<p>From the South came the red wolf called Firewalker guardian of Fire and
from the West came Wavedancer the black wolf guardian of Water. </p>

<p>The now pale and shaken young priest then began his third circuit of the
circle he began chanting the casting of the circle of protection, until
he ended up where he started. He then returned to the old high priest
and awaited his next duty. </p>

<p>The old priest turned and looked at the two young people in front of him
and with an amused twinkle in his surprisingly bright hazel eyes gave
the now even more nervous couple a friendly grin. </p>

<p>"I would call that an auspicious start, wouldn't you?" he said with an
infectious chuckle. "It seems the powers want you two together so I'd
better get this dog and pony show on the road. An old man like me can't
afford to get the powers mad at him." </p>

<p>Everyone around the alter heard him and they all couldn't help but let
out a tense chuckle, which was what he was shooting for. </p>

<p>Letting a serious expression come over his features he pounded his iron
shod staff on the ground 3 times to call everyone's attention. </p>

<p>"You have come to this altar of your own free will to join with your
chosen mate." he turned and looked at Buffy and Willow who nodded their
agreement then he continued to the spectators. "Who sponsors and
supports this union of souls?" </p>

<p>The four witches that had accompanied them started to step forward to
vouch for the couple but found they couldn't move or speak. The air
between them and the couple seemed to shimmer and bend then three
figures stepped out of a portal. </p>

<p>"That would be our place." came the husky voice of the statuesque red
head who turned to Buffy and smiled mischievously. "Did you think this
would go by without our notice Slayer?" </p>

<p>"Morrigan!" Buffy shouted, and grabbed the tall woman in a fierce hug
that would have broken a lesser person. "Gods I'm glad you guys came,
but we weren't sure it was allowed." </p>

<p>Brigit walked up to a happily tearful Willow and kissed her lightly on
the cheek. </p>

<p>"You are restarting a circle that we thought was gone for eternity." the
soft reassuring voice of Brigit began. "And with the two of you taking
over where we were forced to leave off, all those many generations ago,
we simply could not miss it." </p>

<p>"Now that all is as it should be, friend priest, let us begin." Lugh
called out, his deep voice reverberating through the night air. "Before
these women drown us in tears of joy." </p>

<p>Morrigan sniffed and shot a withering at her friend and ancient mentor,
to which he returned a knowing and compassionate smile. </p>

<p>"We have come to sponsor these new Sisters of the Soul." Morrigan
announced proudly. "And to promise our support and the support of all
that follow our path." </p>

<p>The old priest nodded his head and for a moment was at a loss for words.
Even he, who thought he'd seen everything, had to admit that in all his
years not once had a legendary god figure actually come to a ceremony. </p>

<p>Now here in this quiet little burg three of the most famous of the
ancient Celtic legends had come to sponsor a lesbian couple. </p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and swore to himself to get good and drunk
before he tried to comprehend what was happening.
The old priest picked up a razor sharp two edged dagger from the alter
and held it in front of him over the altar. Willow reached out her hand
and placed it palm up under the blade and Buffy placed her hand palm
down over the blade lacing her fingers with those of her love. </p>

<p>Morrigan picked up a long green and white ribbon and tied it around
their hands so that they held the knife tightly between their palms. </p>

<p>Facing each other Buffy and Willow gazed deeply into the eyes of the
person they loved most in the world and simultaneously began the ritual
they'd learned by heart from the Book of Souls.

"I give you that which is mine to give" </p>

<p>The voices of the two lover's recited harmonised, their expressions
showing that they meant every word they were saying.</p>

<p>"I am free but I shall serve you in those ways you require
and the Honeycomb will taste sweeter coming from my hand"</p>

<p>The words were at once ancient and timely</p>

<p>"I pledge to you that yours will be the name I cry out in the night
Yours will be the eyes into which I smile each morning.
I pledge to you the first bite of my meat, and the first drink from my
cup.
I pledge to you my living and my dying each equally in your care.
I shall be the shield at your back and you at mine.
I shall not slander you nor you me.
I shall honor you above all others and when we quarrel we shall do so in
private, and tell no strangers our grievances.</p>

<p>This is my joining vow to you.</p>

<p>This is a joining of equals.</p>

<p>A joining of sisters."</p>

<p>The old priest looked at the two young women and quietly scanned them
with a knowing eye and judged that these two women were entering this
union seriously and with their eyes open, free of illusions. </p>

<p>He then looked at the three rather imposing figures standing behind them
and with a nod from Lugh he began the blessing. But this was one he'd
never done before. </p>

<p>This binding was far more than any he'd ever done before, the power
present at this ceremony was at a frighteningly high level, giving him
pause at what the two young women had insisted upon. </p>

<p>However he remembered that this was no ordinary joining and felt
compelled to carry out their wishes. </p>

<p>He cleared and in a voice that belied his age intoned the words that had
been given him.

"These promises you make,
By the Sun and the Moon
By Fire and Water
By Day and Night
By Land and Sea

With these vows you swear by the God and Goddess
To be full partners each to the other
If one drops the load the other will pick it up
If one is discredited the other her honor
will be forfeit, generation upon generation until she repair that which
is damaged
and finds that which was lost </p>

<p>He stopped long enough for his words to sink in, then
continued. </p>

<p>"Should you fail to keep the oaths you pledge,
The Elements themselves will reach out and destroy, erasing all evidence
of your existence." </p>

<p>As the old man recited his final words a swirling vortex of neon green
and pure white light rose from the ground at Buffy and Willows feet and
grew until it surrounded the five figures at the front of the alter. </p>

<p>The spinning lights rose into the night sky the colors swirling and
mixing intensifying growing stronger and brighter with each word spoken
until it covered the sky over the clearing blocking out the moon and
stars. </p>

<p>The light became so bright people were forced to shield their eyes and
were unable to look directly at the couple and their sponsors. </p>

<p>Then as the light reached it's peak, Brigit reached up and quickly
pulled the dagger out from between their tightly bound hands. </p>

<p>Blood flowed freely from the bone deep cuts across the palms of the
Slayer and her Sorceress, mixing and running onto the ground at their
feet. </p>

<p>As the blood flowed their voices rose in unison loud enough for all to
hear.</p>

<p>"With this we are joined<br>
Body to body<br>
Mind to mind<br>
Blood to blood<br>
Two halves of the some soul<br>
Now and for eternity<br>
Friends, lovers, soulmates, Sisters" </p>

<p>With a blinding flash the light disappeared. </p>

<p>As if to signal the end of the ceremony all four wolves got up and
howled eerily then turned and trotted into the trees, disappearing into
the quickly dissipating fog. </p>

<p>Morrigan and Brigit gave the girls goodbye hugs and stepped back
allowing Lugh room to step up to the newly joined couple and lay his
hands on their shoulders. </p>

<p>The three looked into each others eyes theirs shining with unshed tears
of pure joy, his with pride in these two brave young ones entering into
a war that had begun before time and would continue on long after they
were gone, facing it unflinchingly, head-on with full knowledge of the
consequences of their choice even when other so called great warriors
would cower in fear. </p>

<p>"Be well young ones." Lugh said, his voice thick with unaccustomed
emotions. "We will be together again, if not in this life than the
next." </p>

<p>With that he joined the two women and opened the portal. </p>

<p>"Do we leave them like this." Brigit asked not happy with leaving her
one time student and her Slayer to their own devices </p>

<p>"Worry not dear one." Lugh reassured "We have yet to meet their wizard.
He has yet to reveal himself." </p>

<p>That said the two women followed him through the portal that vanished as
soon as they were through it. </p>

<p>The attendants hurriedly went to the couple and untied the ribbon that
held their hands together so they could bandage the wounds from the
dagger. </p>

<p>To their amazement when the women examined the couples palms and washed
off the remaining blood, there were no open cuts, only matching scars
that crossed their palms, obliterating their lifelines. </p>

<p>After discussing it with the old high priest, Buffy and Willow along
with the four coven members that had seen and heard everything, decided
that it would be best not to discuss the unusual occurrences the had
happened that night. </p>

<p>The old priest made both of them promise that after everything settled
down the three of them would sit down and have a long talk about their
sponsors. </p>

<p>That problem dealt with, the party followed their guests to another area
where there was a large banquet hall that had once been the mess hall
for the camp site and began the festivities that traditionally went with
a proper joining ceremony. </p>

<p>At Buffy's suggestion, she and Willow acquired the keys to one of the
cabins and claimed fatigue after back to back parties.
After suffering the inescapable snide remarks and lame sexually
suggestive jokes at their expense the two lovers slipped away from their
celebrating friends, old and new, and hurried through the primeval woods
to one of the well equipped cabins. </p>

<p>They stopped on the front porch and Buffy followed Willow's gaze up into
the night sky and the slowly setting moon. </p>

<p>"What's up Wills?" Buffy asked nuzzling her partner's neck, knowing full
well the effect it had on her passionate lover. "Don't cha wanna go
inside and get re-acquainted, babe." </p>

<p>Kissing her way up the red head's neck until she reached the ear, she
took the sensitive lobe between her teeth nipping it lightly causing the
already aroused witch to moan loudly. </p>

<p>"Still wanna star gaze, witchy-poo." the blonde seductress purred into
her lover's shell like ear. "You know there's a really nice hot tub in
there just waiting for us to finish communing with nature and start
honeymooning." </p>

<p>With a sexually charged growl Willow spun around in Buffy's arms and
claimed the Slayers lips with her own. </p>

<p>Buffy ran her tongue over her lover's lips, demanding entrance that was
gladly given. Tongues swirled around each other exploring their lover's
sweet mouths. </p>

<p>Buffy coaxed Willow's tongue into her mouth and sucked on the squirming
flesh as she held it in place with her teeth forcing a whimper of
surrender from the red haired witch. </p>

<p>Lifting her lover Buffy carried her partner into the cabin and kicked
the door shut behind them. </p>

<p>Shadows of clothing flew across the window shades. Squeals and giggles
of delight soon were overcome by moans.
Growls and screams of undiluted animal pleasure filled the air around
the cabin, it's occupants safe and secure guarded by state of the art
security systems and by ancient and powerful magiks that held back the
terrors of the night. </p>

<p>A pair of malevolently glowing eyes watched the cabin, listening to the
hateful sounds of the two women that the owner of the eyes despised more
than anything else in the universe and felt actual jolts of pain because
of their pleasure. </p>

<p>It had tried earlier to enter the grounds but was driven back by the
area's sacred status. That too heightened his rage over the very
existence of the two women. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Just wait, you whores of the light.&lt;&gt; it thought, it's mind seething
with it's insane rage. &lt;&gt;You are alive because that bastard Kresis
interfered with the mistress. It won't happen next time.&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>AND THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME! </p>
