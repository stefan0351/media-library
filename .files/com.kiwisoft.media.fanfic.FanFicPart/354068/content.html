<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 12 -->

<p>It was just past nine by the time Brooke made it back home, the walk between
her house and Josh's having passed by in a blur.  Her mind was spinning with
everything that had happened in not only the past few weeks or days, but the
past few hours.  Everything that had happened came clashing together in her
mind painfully, making her head pound and  her heart contract agonizingly
every time she took a breath. She felt like everything was falling apart
right before her eyes, and she couldn't help the fact that her mind kept
wondering back to times before, times when things were if not simple then at
least easier. She wondered what had possessed her to think that she could
get away with colouring outside lines, that thinking outside of the box
would bring anything but trouble, misery and destruction.  Everything she
knew was on the verge of collapse, her whole life was hanging on the edge of
some precipice she had seen herself approaching but disregarded until it was
too late.  Now all of the players were on the stage and all the cards had
been laid out and all eyes were on her.  And, she discovered, at this
critical moment, she suddenly found that the only thing she was sure of was
that she wasn't sure of anything anymore.  In fact, the only thing that
seemed to be going at all her way was that by the time she got home everyone
had just finished eating dinner, which meant she would be spared the agony
of having to sit through it on this particular night.</p>

<p>Making a little wave to three people gathered in the kitchen she then made a
bee-line for the stairs offering no other acknowledgement of their presence.
  Once she had reached the landing she made a movement to her left towards
her door, then stopped.  Although she had initially ignored it, almost the
moment after she had passed the kitchen she had become aware that someone
had started after her.  She knew who it was, and that it probably would have
been easier for her to just continue on into her room, but she just
couldn't, so once she stopped she slowly turned around and waited for Sam to
catch up with her.</p>

<p>"Is everything alright?" Sam asked watching the blonde carefully.</p>

<p>"I'm just tired," Brooke responded evading the question and Sam's eyes by
looking at the wall just beyond her.  "I'll see you in the morning," she
continued a moment later seizing the opportunity presented by Sam's
momentary silence.  With that she started to turn around and head towards
her room, but something stopped her before she had actually began to move
again and compelled her to turn back towards Sam.  Closing the small
distance between them Brooke placed her hand on Sam's cheek then leaned in
pressing her lips to the brunette's drawing her into a brief, confused
kiss, that was desperate, and sad, and longing all at once.  Then pulling
away from the other girl, Brooke immediately turned around and made her
exit.</p>

<p>Sam watched Brooke's retreating figure worriedly, her eyes trailing the
other girl all the way into her room.  On a normal day this type of
desolate, anti-social behavior would have worried the brunette, but
considering the fact that Brooke had already been tense because of Nicole's
reaction to them, and the fact that she had just come back from a *long*
midnight stroll with her ex-boyfriend, Sam was beyond worried.  Sighing the
brunette ran a hand through her hair restlessly, then headed for her own
room deciding that the entire situation sucked to high heaven.</p>
