<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Four -->

<p>Megan let out an exasperated sigh as she listened to the overly cheerful recorded voice.
			<b>
				<i>"Thank you for calling Premier Auto Club, your 24 hour highway helpers. Due to heavy call volume, anticipated wait time for assistance is approximately 45 minutes. Please do not hang up and call back. This will only increase your wait time. Thank you for your patience." </i>
			</b>"45 minutes my ass!" The frustrated blond growled as she slammed down the receiver. "Oh well, maybe someone in here will know how I can get back to civilization."
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>A light snow was beginning to fall as Randi reached the fork that separated her road from the two-lane highway that led into Cutters Gap.
			<i>Huh, it's starting earlier than they said it would. It doesn't matter, I'll still be able to get in and out and back up the hill before it gets sloppy. </i>Checking briefly for any oncoming vehicles and seeing none, Randi punched the gas pedal and pulled onto the road that headed into town.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Megan was pleasantly surprised when she entered Toby's Gas & Grocery. The interior of the store was spacious, well lit, and seemed to have a little bit of everything. Off to her left were several mid-sized isles that carried the usual assortment of canned goods and sundries. The back wall sported two refrigerator cases. The long one carried an impressive variety of cold drinks, and the shorter one contained dairy products and cold cuts. Directly to her left there was a large cold case that held locally raised meats and poultry. Straight in front of her stood a long magazine rack that held a decent variety of magazines. There was even a section that boasted the latest in paperback books. Finally, to her right, a long counter that ran the length of the store. Half of which offered freshly prepared cold cut sandwiches and fountain sodas. The other half of the counter bearing the checkout registers.
			<i>Oh yeah, this will work,</i> Megan grinned to herself. Megan wandered up to the sandwich counter and eyed the selection of sandwiches listed on the handpainted sign.
		</p>
		<p>"Good morning, young lady! And how are you this morning?" Boomed a deep masculine voice. </p>
		<p>Megan turned at the greeting and watched as a mountain of a man ambled her way from the back of the store. He had to be at least 6'8", broad shouldered with thickly muscled arms. He had a barrel chest that tapered only slightly at his waist and thighs that resembled small tree trunks.
			<i>Good God! I've seen smaller mountains.</i> His shoulder length salt & pepper hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail and his craggy face, though lined with age, was ruggedly handsome. As he approached her, it briefly occurred to Megan that she would hate to meet this man in a dark alley, but his warm open smile and gentle gray eyes quickly displaced that thought. Suddenly it occurred to Megan that she was gaping, and with a mental head slap she responded. "Oh! Uh, I'm fine. I was just looking at your sandwich selection and remembered that I skipped breakfast."
		</p>
		<p>"Well now," he replied, "a little thing like you shouldn't be missing meals, young lady." He passed her and reached behind the counter, pulling out a high wooden stool. Whipping a hand towel from his back pocket, he wiped off the already clean seat and placed it in front of the counter. "Why don't you have a seat and let me whip you up my famous Turkey Breast and Bacon Special?" Before Megan had a chance to reply, her empty stomach loudly rumbled its reply. The petite blond blushed prettily at the amused twinkle in his eyes. "I'll take that as a 'yes'," he chuckled. As he set about preparing her sandwich, curiosity got the better of her and she wandered over to the stand that held the paperbacks. </p>
		<p>"My name's Toby, by the way," the large man called from behind the counter. "And I'm sure you've heard this line before, but I swear you look familiar. Have you visited Cutters Gap before?"</p>
		<p>"No, I've never been to this area before," Megan replied. Her eyes twinkled merrily as she spied a certain book in the rack. She picked it up and walked back over and lightly plopped it on the counter. "But you may have seen me before." She offered cryptically. Toby turned and looked down at the counter. His eyes grew saucer wide as he looked down picture of the pretty, petite blond woman gracing the back cover of the book, and then back up to the meadow green eyes of the living thing.</p>
		<p>"Well, I'll be whipped," he exclaimed as he hurriedly wiped off his hands. "If it isn't Megan Galagher in the flesh." Holding out a large hand he continued. "Wait til I tell the missus that I shook the hand of the woman behind 'Samantha Steele, Private Investigator'. Some mighty fine reading, if I do say so myself."</p>
		<p>Megan smiled and took the proffered hand in a warm handshake. "Thank you. I'm glad you like her. Sam is pretty easy to write for. She has a penchant for attracting murder, mystery, and mayhem, but she thrives on it."</p>
		<p>"Heh, she also thrives on handing the bad guys their butts in a sling," Toby chuckled. "Black hair, gray eyes, six feet of muscle and attitude.... That's
			<b>my</b> kind of woman," the storekeeper mock growled. The petite blond shook her head and laughed.
		</p>
		<p>"So what brings you to Cutters Gap?" The big man inquired as he handed the writer her sandwich and soda. "No offense, but it wasn't by choice," the blonde offered as she picked up the sandwich and took a bite, rolling her eyes and humming in delight at the heavenly taste. Causing the big man to grin proudly. "The attendant at the last gas station I stopped at, told me that if I kept straight on Highway 41, it would lead me directly to the Interstate in about twenty miles. That was thirty miles ago." The writer finished dejectedly.</p>
		<p>The older man blew out his cheeks and scowled. "That last gas station you stopped at was in Knox City, right?" Megan nodded and he continued. "And, about ten miles out, Highway 41 split, right?" Another nod. "I don't suppose he told you that you would have had to branch off to the left, did he?" Megan sighed. "No, he sure didn't." The big man patted her hand reassuringly. "Well don't you worry young lady. You're not too far from the Interstate; you finish eating and old Toby will tell you exactly how to get there." Looking out the plate-glass window at the falling snow he added.</p>
		<p>"You should be well on your way before the snow starts to stick." Reassured, the young woman dug back into her sandwich with gusto and the two talked some more about the daring detective.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Randi stomped her boot-clad feet to dislodge the snow that stuck to them. She had just finished filling the twin five-gallon cans that she had strapped to the back of her Jeep Cherokee, from the kerosene tank behind Toby's store. The snow had begun to fall harder and was accumulating quickly on the ground. The tall woman wanted to finish her supply run and get back up the hill before the driving became hazardous.</p>
		<p>She opened the door and walked into the cheery warmth. Looking around, she spotted the big man talking to a petite strawberry blond. Toby noticed the statuesque brunette immediately, a huge grin creasing his face. "Randi," he bellowed. Excusing himself from the young woman, he exited from behind the counter, walked up to the tall woman, and wrapped her up in a big bear hug. "It's good to see you, girl. I was wondering if I'd see you before old man winter had his way with us." Randi returned the hug, allowing herself this small comfort from an old friend. Stepping back when he released her, she shrugged, "I figured I'd better grab some extra kerosene and food for my furry freeloaders." Almost as an afterthought, she added, "I also wanted to see if you'd gotten in any new books. I've got a feeling I'm going to need something to keep me from going stir crazy."</p>
		<p>"Funny you should mention that," the storeowner replied with a twinkle in his eye. "We got a good shipment in last week, and this week we've even got one of the book writers." At Randi's quizzical look he chuckled, "C'mon, let me introduce you to someone." Slipping a big hand under her elbow, he led her over to the seated woman.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Megan turned in her seat to get a better look at the woman who'd just entered the store and who'd been quickly engulfed in the big man's arms; she nearly gasped aloud when the woman stood back. The vision before her was six foot tall, if she was an inch, with silken raven-colored hair that flowed gracefully across broad shoulders. Her black bomber jacket couldn't disguise her well-endowed chest and trim waist. Muscular Jean-clad legs seemed to go on forever before stopping at her charcoal-hiking boots. Dragging her eyes back up, Megan was captured by the crystal blue eyes, set off by thick dark lashes and high cheekbones.
			<i>Good lord! Except for the blue eyes, that could be Samantha Steele come to life. </i> Megan broke out of her reverie and stood as the pair approached her.
		</p>
		<p>"Dr. Randi Oakes, allow me to introduce you to Ms. Megan Gallagher." The man-mountain grinned as the two women clasped hands. "The lovely Ms. Gallagher is the brains behind..."</p>
		<p>"Samantha Steele," the tall woman finished, quirking a grin and releasing the smaller hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Gallagher. Samantha Steele is quite the popular detective." Randi was polite, but Toby sensed coolness in the quiet but normally friendly woman.</p>
		<p>"It's nice to meet you, Dr. Oakes," Megan smiled. "And thank you. It's always nice to meet another Samantha Steele fan."</p>
		<p>"I said she was quite the popular detective, Ms. Gallagher; I didn't say I was a fan," Randi returned demurely. Noting the looks of puzzlement on the faces in front of her, Randi explained. "There's a little too much bias in your stories for my tastes."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Dr. Oakes, I don't quite follow you." Megan was puzzled and more than a little flustered at the accusation. </p>
		<p>Randi took in the faces of the two people in front of her, noting the confusion on one, and concern on the other.
			<i>I'm not in the mood for this. I came in here for supplies, not a debate.</i> "Look...never mind. Let's just say Samantha Steele isn't my cup of tea and leave it at that." With that, the tall woman started to turn away. She was stopped by a light touch on her arm.
		</p>
		<p>"Please, Dr. Oakes," the small blonde pleaded. "I'd really like to know what you are talking about. I try really hard not to offend any ethnic or religious groups."</p>
		<p>Randi sighed and turned, looking first at her friend, who stood with his arms folded across his massive chest and his bushy eyebrows furrowed in consternation, and then at the troubled expression on the small woman in front of her. "Ms. Gallagher, I've read quite a few of your stories. And, while they are gripping mysteries, they all have one recurring and disturbing trend. They all feature gay and lesbian characters. And those characters are always portrayed as being sick, twisted and immoral. That is a malicious, incorrect, and inflammatory stereotype, Ms. Gallagher, and I find it offensive."</p>
		<p>Megan's confusion turned to cold indifference as she stepped back from the taller woman. "I call them as I see them, Dr. Oakes. Those kind of people are an affront to society, and serve absolutely no purpose in this world. I'm sorry if my portrayals of these individuals offend you."</p>
		<p>Toby was stunned at the sheer venom of the younger woman's words. He stepped back as Randi stepped closer to the strawberry blond. Her narrowed eyes were chips of ice. "These 'people,' as you refer to them, are just that;
			<b>people.</b> No different from you, or your readers, except in whom they choose to love. They are your doctors, your lawyers, your friends, and your family. They have a hard enough time dealing with a society that won't accept them, and laws that don't protect them. They don't need to be the poster children for your small-minded prejudice."
		</p>
		<p>"Well my 'small-minded prejudice' doesn't seem to bother the public-at-large, Dr. Oakes," the writer replied with smug venom. "As my book sales will attest to. If the faggots have a problem with it, they don't have to read it."</p>
		<p>"Well, Ms.Gallagher, the 'public-at-large' also gobbles up the tabloids that feature women giving birth to three-headed babies," the tall woman smirked and shrugged. "Go figure."
			<i>Gotcha!</i> the tall woman thought smugly, as she saw the flush of anger creep up the smaller woman's neck. "And trust me, the 'faggots'
			<b>don't </b>read your books...
			<b>we</b> would rather read a grocery list."
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Megan stared blankly for a moment before the words sank in. Green eyes sparked and full, pink lips grimaced in distaste. "A goddamned dyke," she growled. "I should have known." She spun on her heel and, grabbing her dayplanner from the counter, she addressed the storekeeper. "I appreciate your hospitality, Toby, but I think I'd better leave. The less time I spend around her," casting a glare at the stone-faced physician, "the cleaner I'll feel."</p>
		<p>Toby didn't want it to end like this. He began to protest. "Aw, Ms. Megan, please..."</p>
		<p>Megan cut him off, a plea in those fiery, green eyes. "Please Toby, just let me pay for my food, and tell me how to get to the highway."</p>
		<p>The big man sighed and shook his head. "There's no charge for the food." He waved off her attempted protest. "No charge! Now, to get to the highway, just take a right when you leave here, and follow the road for about three miles. You'll see a..."</p>
		<p>"The snow's getting too deep." Randi cut him off. She was staring out the window at the hard-falling snow. "If that's her car out there, it's not going to make it. She'd be better off waiting it out."</p>
		<p>"The Hell I will!" the little blond snarled. "I'd rather end up face-down in a snow drift than spend another moment here with you." With that, she stormed out the door and ran to her car.</p>
		<p>The doctor and the storekeeper stood and watched as the Lexus sped, slipping and sliding, onto the main highway. Gray eyes turned to blue and held for a moment before the tall woman shrugged. "She'll be back," Randi offered with more confidence than she felt.</p>
		<p>"I hope so," the older man mumbled with some concern. He studied the floor for a moment before meeting her eyes again. "A little hard on her...weren't you?" He commented, not unkindly. </p>
		<p>"Not as hard as she is, on people she doesn't even know," Randi shot back sharply. Instantly regretting her attitude with the older man, Randi ran her fingers through her hair and sighed. "Toby, what she's doing is wrong. There are people out there who think the way to improve society is to paint the pavement with some queer's blood; and the picture she paints of gay people only lends credence to that theory."</p>
		<p>The big man pondered her words. "I never thought about that," the older man offered. "Truth to tell, I never picked up on the 'evil-gay-character' trend either." He grinned apologetically. "I guess I was just too caught up in the action."</p>
		<p>The tall woman shook her head and smiled. "She does write a gripping story, I'll give her that."</p>
		<p>The subject of the writer having been dropped, both were at a loss as to what to say next. Finally, the older man broke the silence. "When are you going to come to dinner again?" he inquired gently. "Kate really misses her culinary test subject, says she's tired of hearing 'not enough pepper' from me," he teased hopefully. </p>
		<p>Randi bowed her head and sighed.
			<i>I knew this was coming. </i> "I don't know, Toby," she mumbled. "I'm just not ready to face people right now."
		</p>
		<p>"Kate and I are not just 'people,' Randi...we're your friends. We have been ever since you first came to Cutters Gap," the older man rebutted, mildly scolding. He placed a caring hand on her shoulder. "And when
			<b>will </b>you be ready, Randi? It's been damn near a year! I can almost...
			<b>almost </b>understand your leaving the hospital because of the memories. But, honey, I cannot, for the life of me, understand your walking away from a brilliant career and cutting yourself off from everyone that cares about you." Tucking a thick finger under her chin, he nudged her head up until his eyes caught hers. "It wasn't your fault, child."
		</p>
		<p>Randi felt the familiar ache wrap itself around her chest and begin to squeeze. Her eyes and throat began to burn, and she knew that if she didn't get away soon she would fall apart...again. Gathering up her dwindling self-control, she patted his hand and smiled crookedly. "I'm getting there, Toby," She lied. "I just need a little more time to get through this. Can you give me that?"</p>
		<p>The storekeeper knew she wasn't being completely honest with him, but knowing how skittish she was right now, he didn't want to push. "Okay," he smiled reassuringly. "I can do that." </p>
		<p>Randi let go of the breath she didn't know she was holding. "Great! Well, I guess I'd better finish up and get out of here before Ms. Poison Pen comes back," she mock-shuddered, then headed toward the books.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>
			<i>I can't fucking believe it!</i> Megan seethed, as she sped down the snow-laden road.
			<i>She has the nerve to be offended by my writing when her whole lifestyle is an offense. Huh, wait 'til she sees my next story; I'll really give her something to be offended about. </i>The small blond grinned evilly at the thought. She frowned again as another; more troubling thought came to mind.
			<i>I can't believe how much she resembles Samantha Steele; ugh!</i> "Well, Sam," she mused aloud, "you're about to get a thorough makeover, girlfriend."
		</p>
		<p>Megan slowed the car as she came to the fork that separated Randi's road from the highway. "Damnittohell!" the writer cursed aloud, "Toby didn't mention this in his directions."
			<i>He hadn't finished giving directions before 'Dr. Dyke' butted in; </i>a little voice reminded her. "She should have minded her own damned business," Megan grumbled. She studied the road, searching for some kind of sign that would tell her which way to go. Finding none, she resigned herself to turning around and going back for more directions. She paused when she noticed faint tire tracks in the road to her right. "Well,
			<b>somebody </b>went this way," the author concluded, not knowing that they were the tracks Randi had made on her way into town. Satisfied with her decision, the writer stepped on the gas.
		</p>
		<p>Megan negotiated the curvy road with growing unease. The snow was getting deeper; making it harder to maintain control, and the writer was beginning to worry. "This isn't working. I'm going to have to turn around," the writer mused aloud. "God, I just hope
			<b>she </b>isn't there."
		</p>
		<p>She was so intent on finding someplace to turn around; the writer didn't see the small, speckled fawn emerging from the trees until she was almost upon her. With a shrieking curse, the blonde hit the brakes and swerved to the right as the frightened animal bolted to the left. Desperately trying to regain control, the writer spun the steering wheel back to the left, bringing the front end back to the road, but losing the rear end as it fishtailed off the shoulder. The rear wheel buckled on impact with a low lying tree stump, and the laws of momentum flexed their muscles as the Lexus somersaulted three times through the snow-covered brush before coming to rest, wheels down, against an unforgiving maple.</p>
