<!-- High School Hell \ Primal Screams -->

<p>Brooke was getting worried. Sam had been home a week and it'd been two since she'd gotten through to Sam in her hospital room and while Sam was again progressing in rehab, the brunette was still dangerously depressed. Everyone noticed it. The spark that was uniquely Sam McPherson was gone and it was scary to Brooke. It was like Sam was only doing as she was told and beyond that she could have cared less. </p>
<p>"Sam?" she called to get the other girl's attention. Sam looked up from her magazine. </p>
<p>"Hmmm?" another thing was that Sam didn't speak unless you really provoked an answer out of her. Her responses consisted of `hmmms' and `uh-huhs' unless you made her vocalize more. Brooke actually had to put effort into making Sam talk and that was out of character for Sam. </p>
<p>"Is everything OK with you, outside of the rehab stuff I mean? You seem a little withdrawn lately," Brooke said evenly. Sam looked at her blankly. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh," she answered blandly. Brooke had to force herself not to slap Sam across the face. </p>
<p>"Stop that, will you?" Sam blinked at her. "You have a wonderfully, obnoxiously large and copious vocabualry that you delight in using if only to make other people feel inferior. Stop with the caveman grunts for answers and talk to me," Brooke ordered. Sam set down her magazine. </p>
<p>"I'm fine," she said curtly. "Happy?" Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, you're shutting everyone out again, don't deny it," she accused. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"My choice," she responded. "I gave you the opportunity to leave if you didn't want to be here and you stayed. There's the door if you've changed your mind." </p>
<p>"Do you love me?" Brooke countered. That threw Sam for a second. </p>
<p>"Yes, of course I do," she finally answered. "God, what a stupid question." </p>
<p>"Then why do you keep trying to get rid of me?"</p>
<p>"Brooke, if it's too hard for you to watch me like this than leave. I won't hold it against you," Sam told her. </p>
<p>"I love you and I'm not going to leave you because of some stupid chair," Brooke huffed angrily. Sam shrugged again. </p>
<p>"Suit yourself but stop getting on my case because I don't feel like talking. If you don't like the way I'm dealing, leave but stop trying to get me to change," Sam snapped back. </p>
<p>(Well, Brooke, that went well) Brooke said sarcastically to herself. (Drive her farther away) She watched as Sam went back to her magazine. (There has to be an easier way) </p>
<p>"Have they given you a timetable as far as walking goes?" Brooke asked trying again to engage Sam in a conversation. Sam sighed heavily and put the magazine down again. She glared hotly at Brooke. </p>
<p>"Another few days and I start with the bars," she snapped. "Now, do you think you can leave me alone? I'm trying to read." Brooke got up and snatched the magazine away from Sam. Sam growled at her. "Give it back."</p>
<p>"Come and get it," Brooke challenged. Sam looked at her in pure fury. </p>
<p>"You know I can't, that's not funny," she hissed. Brooke waved the book in Sam's face, just out of reach. She figured if Sam was going to focus on being angry, she was going to royally piss her off. </p>
<p>"You want it back, get off your lazy, pathetic ass and come get it," she taunted. Sam's face turned red. </p>
<p>"Go eat a Ring Ding you scrawny, emaciated, anorexic, wretched excuse for a popular icon," Sam spat venomously her eyes almost glowing. Brooke felt every word as a physical blow to her mid section. "You make me sick, you self-righteous, self-centered, self-starving, poster girl for the Arian nation!" Brooke blinked at her in surprise. </p>
<p>"Yeah? You're a self-diluted, self-pitying, self-indulgent, spoiled, whining little brat!" she screamed back. "You don't care about anyone but yourself anymore! You're not the only one hurting, Sam!" </p>
<p>"I don't see anyone else restricted to a wheelchair, Brooke!" Sam shouted back. "If anyone else is hurting, it's nothing compared to being reduced to having to depend on others." </p>
<p>(There we go) thought Brooke (the crux of the matter) </p>
<p>"You hate not being independent, don't you?" Brooke said more as a statement than as a question. Sam continued to glare at her in silence. Brooke already had her answer. "You'll be out of that chair soon enough," she pointed out. </p>
<p>"But I'm in it right now," Sam said bitterly. "And I'm not going to drag you down with me so just leave," she said plaintively. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nice try. Especially after all you just said, but no, I'm here to stay." Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Suit yourself," she muttered as she settled back on the bed and closed her eyes. Now it was Brooke's turn to sigh. (And back to square one. Well, at least I tried) </p>

<p>Brooke found Sam sitting on the floor of the bathroom later the next week, staring intently at the empty pill bottle in her hand. Brooke's heart dropped to her feet. </p>
<p>"You didn't," she whispered in horror. Sam looked up at her with a frown. </p>
<p>"And if I did?" she responded. Brooke was very nearly ill at the thought. </p>
<p>"We have to call an ambulance," Brooke said. </p>
<p>"Oh, goody, the hospital again," Sam said snidely. Brooke's worry turned to anger. </p>
<p>"What the Hell is the matter with you? Don't you care that there are people that love you and would mourn you if anything happened?" she yelled. </p>
<p>"I suppose," Sam said around a huge yawn. Brooke bent down and hauled Sam to her feet. She was out of the chair and walking, albeit with crutches or a cane mostly. </p>
<p>"Come on, we're taking you to the hospital," she said firmly.</p>
<p>"No we're not. I didn't swallow the whole prescription, Brooke. I took the last two, as prescribed. I'm just tired cuz they make me that way," Sam sighed. Brooke got angrier. </p>
<p>"Then why did you let me think you did?" she demanded to know.</p>
<p>"You assumed," Sam told her. "I merely asked what would happen if I had swallowed the whole thing." </p>
<p>"You've become a real ass, you know that?" Sam yawned again.</p>
<p>"Whatever. Besides, if I was going to do it, I'd slit my wrists," Sam explained as Brooke set her in her bed. </p>
<p>"That's really not funny," Brooke scolded. </p>
<p>"I'm not kidding," Sam answered seriously. Brooke stared at her for a minute. "Hell, Brooke, I've thought about it. There's only so much a person can take." Brooke blinked away tears. </p>
<p>"Promise me you won't," she asked. Sam didn't answer her. "Sam?" </p>
<p>"Stay with me tonight?" Sam said instead. Brooke frowned. "Please?" With a nod, Brooke crawled into Sam's bed. Sam curled up against her.</p>
<p>"I love you Brooke," Sam whispered. </p>
<p>"If you love me, promise me you won't do anything stupid," Brooke whispered back. Sam was quiet for several long minutes. </p>
<p>"I love you Brooke," she finally repeated. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Sam," Brooke answered with a sigh. "Please don't forget that." </p>
