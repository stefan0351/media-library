<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER SEVEN</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">SAYING GOODBYE</p>
<p>Under any normal circumstances, Lilly would have loved to sit and watch a sunrise with Miley. Today, however, was not normal; and the rising brought neither joy nor relief to the petite brunette still shivering in her arms. Lilly couldn't blame her. Would anything ever truly be right in Miley's world again, now that her beloved mother was gone?</p>
<p>They were lying together on Miley's bed, though neither of them had slept a wink. Lilly held Miley tightly, gently stroking her long auburn hair and whispering what words of comfort she could. She knew her words were probably no comfort at all, but she had absolutely no idea what else to do; and she wasn't going to leave Miley, no matter what. Not now, when her best friend needed her the most.</p>
<p>"L-Lilly?" Miley managed, the first words she'd spoken in some time.</p>
<p>"I'm here, Miley," Lilly whispered back. She had to resist the urge to call Miley 'Smiley', like she usually did. It just didn't seem appropriate now.</p>
<p>"Why?" Miley asked simply, her voice already beginning to crack again.</p>
<p>"Why what, Miley?" Lilly asked her, not understanding.</p>
<p>"Why did He have to take my momma?" Miley whispered sadly. "Why?" She shouted the last word, fresh tears spilling down her face.</p>
<p>"I… I don't know, Miley," Lilly replied, swallowing back her own grief, "but I'd bring her back for you in a heartbeat if I could." Miley buried her face in Lilly's chest again, and Lilly knew she was crying again.</p>
<p>"Don't leave me…" Miley sobbed.</p>
<p>"Never," Lilly said comfortingly, kissing Miley gently on the top of her head. "I'll never leave you, Miley." She felt Miley squeeze her even tighter and Lilly closed her eyes, returning the embrace.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A little while later, Miley finally cried herself to sleep, and Lilly slipped out of her arms to use the restroom for a moment. She didn't want to leave Miley, but her bladder would no longer be denied. So she just hoped she could be quick and get back to the bedroom before Miley woke and found her gone.</p>
<p>As she was getting ready to make her way back to Miley, after her quick restroom visit, Lilly suddenly heard Robbie Ray Stewart's voice from the kitchen nearby. After a moment she realized he was on the phone with someone. Lilly really wasn't trying to listen to his conversation, but she overheard enough to figure out he was talking about Miley's poor mother, and she felt her heart constrict painfully. Curiosity and concern got the better of her, and she tiptoed closer for a moment.</p>
<p>"You're sure she didn't… suffer any?" Robbie Ray asked quietly, fighting back his emotions.</p>
<p>"<i>We're positive, Mr. Stewart,</i>"a solemn doctor's voice replied. "<i>Your wife likely never even knew what was happening to her. The artery in her brain must've ruptured while she was sleeping, and she simply… never woke up.</i>" Robbie Ray closed his eyes and swore softly, willing the tears not to come.</p>
<p>"<i>Mr. Stewart</i>?" the doctor asked, sounding concerned. "<i>Are you all right?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm fine," Robbie Ray lied. "Thanks, doc… for everything. I'll be in touch with the… arrangements."</p>
<p>"<i>Of course. I want to say again how sorry I am about your wife, Mr. Stewart… my deepest condolences to you and your family</i>." Robbie Ray didn't answer; he simply hung up. He felt tears stinging his eyes again, and he slammed his fist down on the counter in front of him in frustration.</p>
<p>"Eeep!" Lilly squeaked, jumping back in alarm. Robbie Ray looked up to see his daughter's best friend standing in the doorway to the kitchen, looking like a deer caught in the headlights.</p>
<p>"Sorry about that, Lilly," he apologized sheepishly. "I didn't know you were there."</p>
<p>"Are you… okay, Mr. Stewart?" Lilly asked him carefully, her heart still beating wildly.</p>
<p>"I'll be fine," he lied again. It was becoming almost second nature to him now. Everyone had asked him the same question; nobody really wanted him to answer truthfully… least of all himself. He turned away from Lilly for a moment to brush a hand across his face, wiping away his tears. Lilly swallowed. She knew Miley's father was crying, though he was trying his best to hide it, and she certainly knew why; she felt her heart ache in sympathy.</p>
<p>"It's okay to cry, Mr. Stewart," she whispered to him, swallowing again. "I miss her too."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lilly," Robbie Ray said softly, his voice heavy with emotion, "but right now… for <i>me</i>… it isn't." Lilly frowned, not understanding.</p>
<p>"I have…" he practically choked on the words, "…to make arrangements to <i>bury</i> my wife, and then somehow find a way to take care of my son and my daughter all by myself, when I haven't the slightest clue how I'm going to do all this alone." Lilly heard his voice crack slightly, though Robbie Ray tried his best to cover it up by coughing. "I just don't have time… to grieve right now. My family needs me… and if I start… I may not stop." Lilly looked at her best friend's father sadly, swallowing back the lump in her throat. Then, without even stopping to think about it, she walked over to him and wrapped her arms around him in a hug.</p>
<p>"You're already the greatest dad Miley and Jackson could ask for," Lilly whispered to him. "You always will be… and I know Mrs. Stewart will rest easy knowing you're here to take care of them."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>When she finally returned to Miley's room, Lilly was relieved to see Miley was still fast asleep. It was not a restful sleep, however. She could tell Miley was dreaming by the way her body twitched beneath the covers, and her quiet whimpering made it clear they were not pleasant dreams.</p>
<p>"Momma…" Miley whimpered. "Please don't leave me…!" Wiping away a tear, Lilly sat down on the bed beside her best friend and gently began to stroke Miley's long auburn hair.</p>
<p>"Shhh… it's all right, Miley…" she whispered. She knew it wasn't though. Right now, reality was no more pleasant than Miley's fitful dreams, but Lilly was determined to do everything she could to help her best friend.</p>
<p><i>…promise me you'll take care of Miley for me…</i></p>
<p>Susan Stewart's words echoed in the back of Lilly's mind, and the blonde tomboy swallowed back her grief. She vividly remembered her conversation with Miley's mother at the hospital, something she had never shared with anyone, and she knew Miley was going to need her now more than ever.</p>
<p><i>… I know you'll be there for her… just like I know you'll always be…</i></p>
<p>"I promise, Mrs. Stewart," Lilly whispered, feeling tears trickle down her cheeks as she looked up at the heavens. "I promise I'll always be here to take care of Miley for you. I know I can never give her the love you did, but I swear I'll love her with everything I've got." Sniffling, Lilly looked back down at her best friend and gave her a gentle kiss on her cheek. Then she carefully slid into bed beside Miley and wrapped her arms around the brunette in a gentle, loving embrace. Miley's tremors eased to a stop, as if she suddenly felt comforted and safe, and her whimpering gradually stopped as well. Holding Miley protectively, Lilly finally let her eyes close and drifted off to sleep.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Time passed, and all too soon, the day of Susan Stewart's funeral finally arrived. Lilly had secretly been dreading it, but not because of her own grief; she was worried about Miley. She knew it was going to be a very, very difficult day for her best friend, and she didn't know what, if anything, she could do to help. The thought made her heart ache.</p>
<p>"Hey," she greeted Miley softly, walked up behind her. Miley was standing in front of the full-length mirror in her bedroom, staring at the simple black dress she had chosen to wear for the service.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Lilly asked her quietly. Miley solemnly shook her head, and Lilly swallowed. She slipped her arms carefully around Miley from behind, holding her in a gentle embrace.</p>
<p>"I know it's gonna be hard," Lilly whispered to her best friend, "but I'll be right here with you, okay? You need to cry, you just let it out."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lilly," Miley whispered, a faint smile appearing on her face for the first time in days. "I don't know what I'd do without you."</p>
<p>"Well, lucky for you, you don't ever have to find out," Lilly quipped. "You're stuck with me for life, Smiley Miley." She rested her head on Miley's shoulder and squeezed the brunette in a hug. They heard a soft cough from behind, and Lilly turned to see Jackson standing in the doorway to Miley's room.</p>
<p>"Dad sent me to see if you two were ready," he said quietly. He was wearing a dark suit and tie, his usually wild hair neatly combed for once. Lilly looked up at Miley for confirmation, and Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we're ready Jackson," Lilly replied softly. She released Miley from their embrace and took her hand. "Remember, I'm right here beside you, Miles."</p>
<p>"I know, Lils… and thank you," Miley whispered to her. They walked together to the doorway where Jackson was waiting, and Miley paused to wrap her arms around her older brother in an unexpected hug. No words passed between the two siblings, but the love and grief they shared would have been obvious to anyone who saw them. After a few moments they parted.</p>
<p>"I love you, Jackson," Miley said to her older brother.</p>
<p>"I love you too, sis," Jackson replied.</p>
<p>"I think I just saw your mom smile," Lilly whispered, smiling.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A chill breeze blew across Rolling Hills Memorial Park as the family and friends of Susan Stewart gathered to say goodbye. The service was a simple one, conducted at what would be the site of her grave. Robbie Ray, Jackson and Miley – with Lilly ever at her side – stood together near the simple gray casket overflowing with daisies. The rest of the mourners gathered around them, listening to the preacher's gentle words as he read Susan's eulogy.</p>
<p>"…above all, I believe Susan Stewart would want to be remembered as a mother," the preacher continued. "She gave selflessly of herself for her children, and they were her world. We know she will continue to watch over them from her place in heaven, and her love will remain with them all the days of their lives." At the preacher's words, Miley wrapped her arms even more tightly around Lilly and buried her face in Lilly's shoulder, crying softly. Lilly held her close and gently ran her hands comfortingly up and down Miley's back.</p>
<p>"I know Miley," she whispered to her best friend. "I know…"</p>
<p>"If anyone has any special thoughts or memories of Susan, her family would now like to invite you to come forward and share them," the preacher announced. Not surprisingly, the first person to do so was none other than Lilly's mother, Heather Truscott. Her eyes were red from crying, and she continued to hold a crumpled tear-soaked piece of tissue in one hand, but she bravely stepped over to the casket.</p>
<p>"Susan Stewart… was one of the sweetest, most loving and most genuine people I have ever met, and I'm proud to call her my friend," Heather said softly, fresh tears glistening on her cheeks. "If there's one thing I'm thankful for through all of this, it's how my own daughter, Lilly, has been there for her best friend Miley through the pain of losing her mother. I can't imagine how hard it's been, but she's given selflessly of herself for someone she cares about… and I couldn't be more proud of her." She turned to look at the lonely gray casket behind her.</p>
<p>"I know Susan would be too."</p>
<p>After the service ended, the mourners slowly dispersed, Heather made her way over to Robbie Ray and his family and embraced each of them.</p>
<p>"Thank you for what you said about Susie, Heather," Robbie Ray said quietly as they gently hugged. "That means a lot."</p>
<p>"I just wish I could do more," Heather replied softly. "I can't tell you how sorry I am." They pulled away and Heather rested her hand on Robbie Ray's shoulder.</p>
<p>"If there's ever anything I can do, all you have to do is ask. I want you to know, I'll always consider you all my friends… and my family."</p>
<p>"Same here, Heather," Robbie Ray said. "You're welcome in our house and with the Stewart family any time." Heather smiled, more tears threatening to spill from her eyes, and hugged Robbie Ray again. Then she hugged Jackson as well, and finally Miley.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry about your mother, sweetie," Heather said softly. "I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make all the pain go away." Miley nodded, hugging Heather Truscott fiercely.</p>
<p>"I wish you could too," she whispered in a broken voice. "Th-thank you… for letting Lilly stay with me."</p>
<p>"Oh, sweetie," Heather whispered in reply, gently stroking Miley's long chestnut hair as more tears soaked her face. "I'm just glad Lilly's been able to help you through this. She's welcome to stay with you as long as you need."</p>
<p>"W-we're gonna go spend some time… at my mamaw's house," Miley managed. "Can… can Lilly come with us?"</p>
<p>"Of course she can, Miley" Heather responded. "I know how much you need her right now." She looked over at her daughter and smiled.</p>
<p>"You're welcome to come with us too, Heather," Robbie Ray added. "I just thought it'd be good to get away for a while and… try to sort things out." He laughed softly.</p>
<p>"My mother didn't exactly leave us much choice, either."</p>
<p>"Well… if you're sure I won't be intruding?" Heather asked carefully.</p>
<p>"Of course not," Robbie Ray answered earnestly. "I told you, you're family too."</p>
<p>"I think I'd like that, then," Heather replied, releasing Miley so she could reach up and wipe away some of her tears. "I think Susan would appreciate it if I spent some time with her family."</p>
<p>"It's settled then," Robbie Ray said. "I have a few things I need to… take care of… and then we can leave tomorrow afternoon."</p>
<p>"How ya holdin' up?" Lilly asked Miley, as the petite brunette returned to her embrace again.</p>
<p>"Okay, I guess," Miley answered, her voice tight. She lowered her head gently onto Lilly's shoulder. "I still wish she was here with me…"</p>
<p>"I know, Miley," Lilly said sadly. "I miss her too… and I know it hurts."</p>
<p>"Is it always gonna hurt like this?" Miley asked miserably, silvery tears streaking down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"No," Lilly answered honestly. "It may take a long, long time, but I promise you'll get through this one day… and I'll be right here to help you."</p>
