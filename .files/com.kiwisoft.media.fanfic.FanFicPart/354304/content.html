<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 41: Together -->

<P>Seven awoke to the familiar sensation of B’Elanna’s breath warming her belly.
She smiled and moved her hand under the blanket and onto B’Elanna’s head. "Come
out of there," Seven said without opening her eyes. "You are going to
suffocate."</P>
<P>B’Elanna growled onto Seven’s belly one last time and then crawled up her
wife’s body. Her face peeked out from under the covers just as Seven opened her
eyes. "I was talking to my daughter… and I will not suffocate," B’Elanna said as
she stretched and kissed Seven’s chin.</P>
<P>"I do not want to risk it." Seven wrapped her arms around B’Elanna’s bare
shoulders. "Perhaps you should use a triox compound before you attempt this
again." Seven moved her hand and gently caressed B’Elanna’s cheek. "I am sure
Opaca would give me a hypospray if I explained your preoccupation with crawling
under the blankets."</P>
<P>"Very funny," B’Elanna said and shifted her weight onto her elbow. "You never
seem to mind me crawling under there when I’m seeing to your needs." Her hand
drifted down and brushed across the tightly curled blonde hairs at the junction
of Seven’s leg. "Maybe I should stop that too?"</P>
<P>"You have not suffocated yet," Seven said logically. "Perhaps I was
overreacting." She held B’Elanna’s hand in place over her most intimate
region.</P>
<P>"Oh really?" B’Elanna raised both eyebrows almost to her hairline. "So, do
you think I should test this new theory of yours?"</P>
<P>Seven reached out and tangled her fingers in B’Elanna’s hair. It was down,
loose, and full of static from her time under the blankets. "I love you," she
whispered, her voice suddenly trembling. She pulled B’Elanna toward her,
cradling her on her chest. Even with Seven’s swelling stomach, they were a
perfect fit. B’Elanna’s body naturally molded around Seven’s, her leg finding
its perfect spot on the former drone’s thigh below her belly. Seven squeezed her
eyes shut and clung to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Are you okay?" B’Elanna asked. She rubbed her wife’s ribs and then down to
her belly, and finally circled her navel.</P>
<P>"Yes. I am just happy." Seven reached down and held B’Elanna’s hand and
kissed the top of her head.</P>
<P>B’Elanna moaned happily and nuzzled Seven’s chest. She loved the creamy
smoothness of her wife’s skin, the way it looked like cream with a hint of
strawberries tinting it. Sometimes she could swear that the strawberry color of
her beloved’s skin had also flavored her as well. B’Elanna kissed the skin she
was studying, letting her lips linger as her tongue reached out to taste the
softness. </P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna murmured. "You taste delicious." Her mouth migrated over to
the sweet bud of Seven’s nipple. It hardened instantly and B’Elanna drew the
tender flesh between her lips so that her tongue could flicker across it.</P>
<P>Seven tried to answer but could only manage a very unBorg-like squeak.
B’Elanna laughed as she moved to the other side so that neither breast would be
neglected.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven managed to whisper. "Please…"</P>
<P>"Shall I test your blanket theory?" B’Elanna whispered as she kissed Seven.
"Right now?" she mumbled between kisses.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered. Her body cried out for her wife’s caress.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes lit up as she began crawling under the blankets, carefully
easing past Seven’s belly. She inhaled deeply, savoring the aroma of her wife’s
arousal just as the door chime sounded.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she held B’Elanna under the blanket. "They will
leave."</P>
<P>The door chime sounded again and B’Elanna rested her forehead on Seven’s hip
and then she laughed. "They’re not leaving," she said from under the blankets.
The door chimed again and the Klingon began giggling.</P>
<P>"This is not funny," Seven said with a growl. She yanked the blankets off of
her naked wife.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she climbed up Seven’s body. "But if I don’t laugh… I
will take my bat’tleth to whoever is at that door. She kissed Seven, her lips
lingered, and she tried to absorb as much of her sweetness as she could.</P>
<P>"Make them leave," Seven whined when the door chime sounded insistently.</P>
<P>"I’ll do my best," B’Elanna promised as she tossed the sheet over her wife’s
gloriously naked body. She grabbed a robe and went to the living area. </P>
<P>"Take your bat’tleth," Seven yelled from the bedroom.</P>
<P>B’Elanna paused next to the door, but decided that arming herself was
probably not the best course of action. "Yes?" she demanded as the door hissed
open.</P>
<P>"Come with me," Tach said as he grabbed B’Elanna’s robe and yanked her into
the corridor. He pulled her out of the way as Nara rushed into her quarters.</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna yelled and pulled her robe closed.</P>
<P>"It is time." Tach continued down the corridor with B’Elanna in tow. </P>
<P>"Ouch," the Klingon said as she stubbed her toe. "Damn it, Tach, what the
hell are you doing?" she asked, hopping on one foot.</P>
<P>"You have agreed to the sacred bond. It is the time of the rising sun," he
said as if that explained everything.</P>
<P>"And it couldn’t wait until I finished making love to my wife?" B’Elanna
demanded, yanking him to a stop. She reached down and rubbed her toe, happily
noticing that she had not drawn blood.</P>
<P>Tach stared at her for a moment and then shook his head and laughed. "Didn’t
you get enough of her yesterday afternoon…or last night?"</P>
<P>"As a matter of fact, no. I didn’t." She crossed her arms over her chest.
"Hey…how do you know what or when we…"</P>
<P>"Oh please, all the sound proofing in the universe couldn’t keep that a
secret," he said. He yanked her down the corridor. "Besides, there’s a pool
going on as we speak."</P>
<P>"What kind of pool?" B’Elanna jogged to keep up with her taller friend.</P>
<P>Tach stopped and pinned her in his gaze, his eyes sparkling with mischief.
"They’re betting on the first night you two don’t…have…intimate relations," he
said. "Nara put twenty of her rations on a year and a half from now."</P>
<P>"You let her bet on my… uh, my…"</P>
<P>"Your sex life," he said with a smile. "I put my rations on two years from
now."</P>
<P>"Paris," B’Elanna said with a growl. "I’ll bet he started this damn thing.
I’ll kill him."</P>
<P>"Wouldn’t it be easier to just be a little more…quiet?" he asked as he took
her arm and moved her toward his destination.</P>
<P>"I don’t think that’s really an option," she said. Her face blushed bright
red and a wicked grin covered her features. She cleared her throat and tugged
her robe closed as they entered the turbolift. "Where exactly are you taking me?
I mean, I am half naked."</P>
<P>"So I noticed," he said as he rolled his eyes.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven called out. She rolled onto her side and tried to look out
of the door into the living room. "Did you kill them, my Be’nal?" she asked with
a smile.</P>
<P>"No, darling," Nara said sweetly as she barged into the bedroom. She scanned
the room and then went to the closet and rifled through the clothing.</P>
<P>"Where is my wife?" Seven demanded, struggling to get out of the bed. Her
huge belly had completely shifted her center of gravity and she still hadn’t
been able to master simple tasks like sitting up.</P>
<P>"It’s time," Nara said as she found a robe. She turned around and laughed at
Seven. She was trying to get off of her back but looked like a sickly turtle
wrapped in a rumpled sheet. </P>
<P>"Time for what?" Seven grunted as she fought to sit up.</P>
<P>"Come on," Nara ordered. She took Seven’s hand and pulled her to her feet.
The sheet fell away and Nara stared at her friend, her eyes taking a complete
inventory of the lanky blonde’s attributes. "How can anyone with a belly that
big look so incredible?"</P>
<P>"What have you done with my wife?" Seven asked as she took her robe. She
shoved her arm into one sleeve, and in her haste, almost ripped out the seams.
Her second arm didn’t have as much luck, and she ended up struggling to find the
opening.</P>
<P>"It’s time for your bonding, my clumsy oaf," Nara said with a laugh. She
grabbed the robe and guided it onto Seven’s arm. "Now, let’s go."</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, but followed her short friend. When they reached the
door, Seven paused.</P>
<P>"What?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna was…displeased the last time I left our quarters dressed only in a
robe." Seven pulled the belt tighter. "She was quite unhinged, and I do not like
to intentionally upset her."</P>
<P>"Yes, Seven," Nara covered her mouth to hide her wicked smile. "But I don’t
think that this robe would have upset her. I heard the other robe was silk…see
through…very short, and left <I>nothing</I> to the imagination." She had heard
about the ill-fated journey from Neelix. Apparently Seven had a craving for
fresh fruit in the early morning hours and went to the mess hall. She grabbed
one of the robes that B’Elanna had given her as a romantic gift, not worrying
that it was mostly see though. B’Elanna did not appreciate the fact that half of
the late night shift ended up escorting Seven back to her quarters, clamoring
for the right to her carry her tray of sliced fruit.</P>
<P>"A valid point," Seven said. "I have never understood why humanoids have such
an aversion to nudity." </P>
<P>Nara opened the door and took Seven’s arm. "It wasn’t any aversion that upset
B’Elanna. It was the line of men following you back to your quarters."</P>
<P>"There were several women as well," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"No doubt." Nara smiled and guided Seven toward the turbolift. "How would you
feel if B’Elanna paraded through the ship half naked…with the crew following to
get a good look?"</P>
<P>Seven’s features darkened. "I am beginning to see my wife’s point," Seven
said.</P>
<P>"I thought you might." Nara shoved Seven into the lift. "Now, you and I have
some work to do." </P>
<P>"I do not think I like the sound of that," Seven said slowly.</P>
<P>"That’s probably because you are a very intelligent woman." She turned to the
comm panel. "Deck six." Nara smirked and leaned against the wall of the lift and
watched the decks flicker past.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"What do you mean ‘take my robe off?’" B’Elanna asked as she glared at Tach.
She was in the orchard standing next to a small hut made with furs and she
didn’t like where the conversation was heading.</P>
<P>"I mean…take off the robe," he said as he pointed at the hut. "But for
goddess sake, do it <I>inside</I> the hut. I don’t need Seven breaking all the
bones in my hand like she did Tom Paris." He went to the hut and flipped back
the hanging fur that worked as a door. "Now, move it before Nara gets here with
Seven. You can’t see her until the ceremony."</P>
<P>B’Elanna grumbled but moved toward the door. "What am I supposed to do once I
go in here and take off my robe?" </P>
<P>"Great goddess above and below…are all Klingons this dense?" Tach pointed
inside the hut. There was a steaming bath filled with rose petals and apple
blossoms and a long cotton robe hanging on the wall of the hut. "You…naked…
bath…robe…Any questions?"</P>
<P>"A ritual bath." B’Elanna nodded her head and then smacked his stomach with
the back of her hand. "Why didn’t you just say so?"</P>
<P>"I thought it was pretty self-explanatory." He shoved her into the hut. "Oh…
you’re supposed to wait in reflective meditation until I come for you," he added
as he flipped the fur door closed.</P>
<P>"Gee thanks," she mumbled and looked around the hut. She dipped her fingers
into the steaming water. "Well, at least the water is nice and hot."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Explain again," Seven ordered as she and Nara climbed off of the turbolift.
Several passing crewmembers watched as she passed, wondering if the Borg
Collective had an affinity for wearing robes.</P>
<P>"First you take the ritual bath, then you put on the sacred robes. You then
have to spend some time in quiet reflection about your feelings for B’Elanna,"
Nara explained.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna does not do quiet reflection," Seven pointed out. "Is Tach
explaining all of this to her?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Nara said, but then paused. "But I’ll check on her as soon as I get
you settled. My husband isn’t known for his ability to explain sacred
rites."</P>
<P>"Why must we do this in the orchard?" Seven asked when they neared the doors
to the new arboretum.</P>
<P>"Well, we’re supposed to do it outdoors with the goddess and her creations
around us. This is the most natural setting on board." Nara stopped in front of
the door. "Let me make sure B’Elanna is in her hut. You two can’t see each other
until the ceremony."</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said slowly. "But do not leave me standing out here too
long. This robe allows an uncomfortable breeze up my legs."</P>
<P>"You’ll live," Nara said with a smirk and she went into the arboretum.</P>
<P>"If my Be’nal finds out that you left me standing out here dressed like this,
you may not," Seven called out as Nara disappeared behind the closing doors.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several minutes later Nara finally had Seven prepared.</P>
<P>"Well?" Tach asked when Nara came out of Seven’s hut. "Did you irritate her
sufficiently?"</P>
<P>"Yes." She tucked her arm under his. "How come I had to piss off the one
who’s capable of bending duranium deck plating?" She led him toward a larger hut
set up at the back of the small orchard.</P>
<P>"Because, my wife, you run faster than I do." Tach opened the flap and
entered the hut. It was large, and had a bath big enough for two. Nara began
undressing as Tach lit the candles around the room and brought a container of
scented soaps to her.</P>
<P>"We’ll give them an hour while we prepare and then I’ll go dress them both."
She climbed into the tub, pausing to dip her fingers into the water and then she
wet her forehead as she said a silently blessing.</P>
<P>Tach stepped into the bath beside her and began lathering her back. She
turned and wet his forehead and he closed his eyes and thanked the goddess.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Quiet contemplation," B’Elanna whispered as she paced the tiny hut. She had
finished bathing and was wearing the cotton robe but she was getting tired of
waiting. She wondered what Seven was doing, then smiled and thought about the
love she had already been blessed to share with her wife. Perhaps the idea of
contemplation wasn’t so bad after all. She closed her eyes and pictured Seven on
Jusari Prime, holding her hand as they walked through the forest and watched the
animals. In some ways she missed the planet and the solitude it provided. Still,
it was good to be back home on <I>Voyager</I>. B’Elanna stopped and her smiled
widened. <I>Voyager</I> truly was a home now that she lived with Seven, and when
the baby arrived, it would be even more special.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Nara folded back the flap. "Ah, you’re ready." She came into the
hut carrying a bundle of clothing. </P>
<P>"How’s Seven?" she asked.</P>
<P>"She is doing fine." Nara smiled. "I need to get you ready for the ceremony,
then I can go dress her as well."</P>
<P>"Do we get to know the meaning behind all of this?" B’Elanna waved her arm
indicating the hut and bath. </P>
<P>"You have been cleansed of all worldly concerns," Nara began. "Which is why
my husband and I tried our best to aggravate you on the way here. You came in
full of outside thoughts. When your thoughts are only of your beloved, the
bonding can take place."</P>
<P>"Well, tell Tach he did a great job." B’Elanna smiled as she studied the
bundle in Nara’s arms. It was a natural fiber, deep green and it looked soft. "I
was about to toss Tach into the tub if he didn’t give me some information."</P>
<P>"Well, he just had his own bath. We just finished our own sacred cleansing."
Nara smiled and unfolded the emerald green fabric. It was a simple dress, and
once it was open, it looked like silk. "Tell me about the first time you knew
you loved Seven." Nara put the dress on a stand nearby.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s face seemed to glow from some internal source. "Well, I wasn’t
exactly thrilled about it at the time." B’Elanna let Nara remove her robe. The
hut was warm from the tub’s steam, but the air was still cool against her bare
skin. She felt goosebumps erupt on her arms and legs. "Seven and I had been on
the planet for a few weeks, and she was really making me angry. Then I looked
over at her as she was stirring the rocks in the fire pit, she didn’t want me to
get cold, and it hit me. I’m falling in love with that irritating woman…
irritating, beautiful, and brilliant…but still, irritating."</P>
<P>"And do you still think she’s irritating?" Nara asked with a smile. She
lifted the silk dress over B’Elanna’s head and smoothed it into place. It was a
good fit, Nara had sewn it the night before, and she had worried that her memory
of B’Elanna’s size might not have been accurate. The rich color complimented
B’Elanna’s coloring and brought out a hint of hazel in her brown eyes.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," B’Elanna said. She had a goofy grin covering her face. "And I
thank Kahless every day that she’s irritating me. I don’t now how I got so
lucky." B’Elanna ran her hands over the fabric. It reminded her of an ancient
Earth kimono except it wasn’t as elaborate. "This is beautiful. Where did you
get it?"</P>
<P>"Well, while you and your wife were up all night... entertaining each other…
I was sewing this." Nara pointed to the dress. "I don’t know if I got Seven’s
right. I swear her belly grows more every second."</P>
<P>"Thank you," B’Elanna said. "I know I was a little grouchy earlier, but we
both appreciate this."</P>
<P>"It is my honor to sponsor you both," Nara said. "Now, I have to go dress
Seven. There’s a hairbrush over there, and some fragrant oils. Go make yourself
beautiful for that wife of yours."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," B’Elanna said with a smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Getting Seven ready took a little more effort. When Nara had gone back to her
hut, Seven had still been in the tub. She was going into her eighth month of the
pregnancy, and was already huge. Nara wondered just how big her belly would get.
She helped Seven out of the tub and dried her, then helped her into her silk
gown. It was the same style as B’Elanna’s but was sapphire blue. The color
accentuated her fair skin and pale eyes.</P>
<P>Nara asked Seven the same questions that she had asked B’Elanna, and was not
surprise when Seven revealed that she had first discovered she was falling in
love B’Elanna several weeks after they arrived on Jusari Prime…late one night
while stirring rocks in the fire pit. </P>
<P>Once Seven was ready, Nara went out into the orchard and spoke with Tach. He
had a small metal fire pit with flames burning down to leave red coals. He
smiled as he saw his wife and hugged her when she came to him.</P>
<P>"Are they ready?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," she answered. She picked up a small container and opened it, carefully
making sure that everything was in its proper place. Satisfied, she put it next
to the fire and went to get Seven while Tach got B’Elanna. They led the two
women out of the huts blindfolded and stood them in front of the fire pit facing
each other.</P>
<P>"As it has always been," Nara said solemnly. "We come to our bonding blind to
the wisdom of the great goddess. She sees our mate long before we ever do. Those
of us who are lucky enough to see through the eyes of true love find the other
half of our soul." She stepped behind B’Elanna as Tach stood behind Seven and
they removed the blindfolds.</P>
<P>"See with the eyes of the goddess," Tach said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven both smiled like children on Christmas morning, both
looking at the greatest gift anyone could ever dream of receiving.</P>
<P>Nara took Seven’s hand and placed it in B’Elanna’s. "Your hearts are bound
already, but it is now time to link your souls."</P>
<P>Tach handed Nara a pair of scissors and she snipped a strand of each woman’s
hair. </P>
<P>"This hair grows like the trees in the forest and the grass in the fields and
it links your souls in the name of the sacred earth. It grows every day, in tiny
amounts that the eye cannot see, but over time it is revealed to all. Let your
love be like that; let each day add to the love you share." She tossed the hair
into a tiny metal bowl that Tach held out. It was only an inch tall, squatty,
and had a blackened finish as if it had been scorched many times. "Do you swear
by the sacred earth to give your soul to your mate?" Nara asked as she gave Tach
the scissors and he put them away and retrieved a tiny knife with a razor-sharp
blade.</P>
<P>"I do," B’Elanna and Seven said in unison.</P>
<P>"Your blood flows with the power of raging rivers and the pounding sea. It
also carries the fire of your soul." Nara took B’Elanna’s and then Seven’s hand
and pricked a finger, collecting a drop of blood in Tach’s bowl. "Do you swear
by the sacred seas and the fire of the goddess to protect each other with all
the passion of these elements?"</P>
<P>"I swear," Seven said. She was looking into B’Elanna’s eyes, seeing all the
love she felt mirrored back to her in her wife’s gaze.</P>
<P>"I do," B’Elanna said. The proud Klingon ignored the tears trailing down her
cheeks. She didn’t want to let go of Seven’s hands even long enough to wipe them
away.</P>
<P>Tach stepped forward and took the knife from Nara and gave her two small
vials.</P>
<P>"Take a deep breath, and as you do, draw in all of the love you feel for each
other," Nara instructed. She handed each woman a vial. "Look into your mate’s
eyes and then release that breath and the air it represents into these
vials."</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven blew into the vials, then smiled at each other as they
waited for Nara to continue.</P>
<P>Nara held up the vials. "Let this represent the sacred element of the air we
breathe and our spirits, also of the air."</P>
<P>Tach took the bowl and placed it on a small table next to the glowing embers.
He took two tiny ingots and put them into the bowl, then added another much
smaller ingot.</P>
<P>"Gold is the sign of purity on many worlds," Nara said. She smiled at
B’Elanna and Seven. "I was happy to see that Earth is one of them. Tach will
melt these pure ingots with the elements from each of you. Your essence will
become part of the metal."</P>
<P>They watched as Tach put the cup on the end of a long metal arm and then
plunged it into the fire pit that served as a kiln. The coals quickly heated the
tiny cup and began melting the ingots.</P>
<P>"We added a smaller ingot for the child you carry," Nara said to Seven. "When
I became pregnant, we renewed our vows and recast our own medallions so that Ty
would have his own. Tach will cast two medallions for each of you. One will be
your bonding necklace and you should wear it forever. The second smaller one you
will wear for your daughter. You will bless it with your love each day that it
lays next to your heart. When your child reaches the age of consent, you will
melt down the smaller necklaces into one. She will wear it as sign to all that
she was born of a sacred bond."</P>
<P>Tach lifted the cup out of the coals and placed it on a stone in front of
B’Elanna and Seven. He carefully positioned four molds next to the cup before
picking up the vials and connecting them to a device similar to a hypospray.</P>
<P>"We’re almost done," Nara whispered with a smile. She cleared her throat.
"Tach will now use your own breath to cool the gold for pouring," she said as
Tach injected the vials of air into the red-hot gold. Tiny bubbles appeared and
then he poured the metal into each of the molds. He filled the larger ones
first, pausing to say a silent blessing before pouring the two smaller ones.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, do you swear by all that is sacred to you that you will give your
heart, soul, spirit and even blood to Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes, gladly," she said as she looked into Seven’s cobalt blue eyes.</P>
<P>"Seven, do you swear by all that is sacred to you that you will give your
heart, soul, spirit and even blood to B’Elanna?" Nara repeated.</P>
<P>"Yes, forever," Seven said.</P>
<P>Nara took a bowl of water and held it out to the couple. "Hold this," she
whispered. Tach took the molds one by one and tapped them on the edge of the
bowl. Each medallion fell into the water with hiss and a flash of steam. Tach
brought over a small case and opened it. It held two golden chains.</P>
<P>"Seven," Tach said as he took the bowl. "Reach in and remove one of each
medallion and put it on a chain.</P>
<P>She reached into the water. She could tell it had been cold, but the heat of
the gold had warmed it. She lifted out two of the pieces, happy when she was
able to grab one of each size on the first try, and threaded them onto the chain
with shaking hands.</P>
<P>"Put this onto your wife," Nara instructed. "You are the only person who can
remove it. It she wants to take it off, only you may unhook this clasp."</P>
<P>Seven put the necklace around B’Elanna’s neck. It took her a moment because
she couldn’t get her shaking hands to work. Finally it latched and she smiled.
"I love you, Be’nal," she whispered as she leaned back.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Nara motioned to the bowl. </P>
<P>B’Elanna repeated the process, but had an easier time with the chain. Her
hands were rock steady, but inside she was trembling. After putting on Seven’s
necklace, she paused to caress her wife’s cheek. "Forever, my wife," she
whispered.</P>
<P>Tach took the bowl of water and poured it onto the coals. It sent up a cloud
of steam with a hiss. He turned to his friends and smiled.</P>
<P>"You are bound," Nara said as she looked at her friends. "You may perform
this ritual for couples you deem worthy. And, if you have another child, you
should repeat it while you are pregnant so that the blood that nourishes the
child will be cast into the medallions."</P>
<P>"Another child?" Seven asked. Her eyes widened and a look of terror covered
her features. "You want me to endure nine additional months of looking like a
shuttle?"</P>
<P>"You are beautiful," B’Elanna insisted. She wrapped her arm around Seven’s
waist. "I think you look very sexy."</P>
<P>"Was I also sexy during my morning sickness?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"How do I answer that?" B’Elanna asked Tach. Her expression revealed that the
Klingon knew that no answer would be the right one.</P>
<P>"You don’t," he said. "You take your wife back to your quarters and celebrate
your bonding in private."</P>
<P>"Smart man," B’Elanna said before tugging Seven toward the exit.</P>
<P>"Indeed." Seven smiled. She happily let her wife lead her out of the
arboretum.</P>
<P>"Very smart man," Nara said as she hugged him. "I knew I married you for a
reason."</P>
