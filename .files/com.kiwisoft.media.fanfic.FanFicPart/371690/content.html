<p>"Whoulda thunk Little Miss Priss and Gumdrop Head were gettin' it on like two of Aunt Pearl's pet rabbits!" Luanne said as she leaned against the doorway, arms crossed and a smirk on her face.</p>
<p>"No Luanne, you don't understand. It's not what it looks like, we were just –"</p>
<p>"Experimentin'?" Luanne finished with an evil smile.</p>
<p>Miley faltered in trying to explain to Luanne what was going on when she wasn't so sure herself.</p>
<p>Lily stepped forward, in front of Miley, as if to protect her from Luanne's wrath. She summoned up her courage, held her head high, and looked Luanne straight in the eye.</p>
<p>"I won't hide my feelings anymore, I'm in love with Miley, I have been for years. I just wish I had told her sooner, before her and Jake had come this far."</p>
<p>"Looks like you made one hella big mistake blondie, wait 'til the press hears 'bout Hanny Montaney leaving Jake Ryan at the altar 'cuz she's a two-timin' lesbian," Luanne sneered with glee at the pair.</p>
<p>"Miley! What if Jake spills your secret? You have to marry him, he could threaten to reveal that you're Hannah Montana," Lilly realized, heartbroken.</p>
<p>"I couldn't care less about what Jake does, if he reveals my secret, it'd be worth it, as long as I'm with you," Miley told Lily, reassuring her with a hand squeeze and light kiss.</p>
<p><i>How could I have waited this long to tell her I loved her, every time I look into her eyes I feel safe, every touch she gives me makes my heart swell, and every kiss we share ignites my soul.</i></p>
<p>Luanne squealed (like a pig, no surprise there) with delight, "I can't wait to tell all them 'bout you two, whoo-whee they're 'a gonna go crazy like a bucking bronco when they find out."</p>
<p>"Luanne, can you bring Jake up here first please, so I can tell him myself, you can expose us to the press and our families and the world, but Jake at least deserves to hear it from me," Miley asked her malicious cousin in a soft voice that made Lily want to hold her tight and kiss her all over her face.</p>
<p>Luanne gave it a minute's thought before shrugging and leaving to get Jake from wherever he was, probably in the lobby signing autographs for his family until the wedding could resume.</p>
<p>Miley stood there, her stomach churning at the thought of explaining to Jake exactly why she couldn't marry him, and at the thought of losing her secret identity. It'd be a major change to say the least, she'd lose the Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana alter-ego, the public might hate her for leaving Jake at the altar, and then the fact she was with her best friend, best <i>girl</i> friend, Miley wasn't even sure where to start with that one. But she had Lily, who loved her and cared about her, that's all Miley needed, the world would just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Lily stood back and observed her girl deep in thought, <i>she always looks so pretty, whether she's dancing or singing or laughing or just…standing there, she's always beautiful and I could never do anything to hurt her, I love her, I just hope everyone will understand. For her sake. </i></p>
<p>The two girls made eye contact and Lily gave Miley a concerned look, which Miley returned with a small, but hopeful, smile. Lily moved forward to embrace the girl of her dreams, Miley lowered her head till it rested in the crook of Lily's neck; Lily let out a giggle when Miley breathed in deeply to take in Lily's scent then let out the lungful of air, letting it flow over Lily's smooth skin. Lily angled her head so she could kiss Miley's head and cheeks, and whisper comforting words into her ear.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>"I refuse to lose you, on our wedding day, to a girl! I'm Jake Ryan!" The would-be groom spit out angrily, face tomato red and neck veins popping out in rage.</p>
<p>"We all know who you are Jake, and I'm sorry it had to happen this way, but I don't love you, I love Lily and there's no one I'd rather be with than her," Miley desperately tried to explain to the star actor.</p>
<p>"No I won't let this happen! I'll be a joke! You have to marry me Miley!" Jake insisted.</p>
<p>"I can't Jake, I won't, even if you threaten to tell –"</p>
<p>"Your secret? I'd never do that Miley, I love you. And you trusted me with your secret identity, as I trust you with my secret. I'd never betray you," Jake said sincerely.</p>
<p>"Aw Jake that's so sweet," Miley admitted, touched by one of his rare earnest moments.</p>
<p>"Jake," Lily interrupted, wary of Miley getting too touched by Jake and changing her mind about Lily, "I never meant this to happen, ruining your wedding and all, but I love Miley and nothing can change that. Honestly I don't know what to do now, if you call off the wedding the paparazzi will have a field day and both families will have a ton of questions, and I don't think any of us are ready to deal with that."</p>
<p>"I know one of my many fans would be thrilled to have the honor of marrying me –," Jake resumed his ego.</p>
<p>"The paparazzi and both families would definitely notice if you had a new bride last minute, none of yours fans look like me, except…one," Miley finished, nodding her head and smiling at Luanne with her 'I've-got-an-idea' face.</p>
