<p>Lily paused in the hotel lobby panting from her physical exhaustion; <i>I'm in Hawaii, where can I run away to in a bridesmaid dress? The hotel room is an obvious choice, only place I know I can be alone.</i></p>
<p>Lily decided to get a move on, she was getting stares from all the people in the lobby and attention was the last thing she wanted now. For once the elevator was ready for the distressed girl who punched the button for her hotel floor, she heard a voice scream out "Wait!" but Lily just pushed the door close button, she didn't feel like dealing with anyone right now.</p>
<p>Lily rushed to her room, slammed the door shut, and lay face down on the twin sized bed. <i>This wasn't how it was supposed to happen, we were supposed to be together, happy and in love. </i></p>
<p>Banging on the hotel room door startled Lily out of her misery, <i>great I get just one minute to wallow in self-pity before I have to face the music and confront the masses.</i></p>
<p>"Lily! Lily please, open the door! Lily!"</p>
<p>Lily sat upright in the bed, surprised, "Miley?"</p>
<p>"Lily! Let me in, we need to talk," Miley insisted, in between another bang on the door.</p>
<p>Lily jumped off the bed and yanked the door open, Miley stood there frozen in place, fist raised to ram the door again. Miley gently lowered her fist and opened her mouth to say something. Lily felt her heart race, then flat-line as Miley closed her mouth and briskly walked past Lily into the hotel room.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>Lily shook with anxiety, <i>I feel sick, what am I supposed to do? How can I possibly expect her to understand, I ruined her wedding with just one word and now if I say anything I might end up ruining our friendship forever. </i></p>
<p>Miley just stood there, refusing to look at Lily and instead stared at a vase of white roses that sat on the windowsill. There was absolute silence in the room except for the faint trace of music that emanated from the reception, probably organized by Jake to distract from the situation of his currently absent bride-to-be. After what seemed like an eternity Miley moved, away from Lily, towards the vase.</p>
<p>"You know, Jake wants to have a son, so he can name him Jake Ryan the 2nd, and in the case we had more than one son, the next would be named Jake Ryan the 3rd, and so on," Miley spoke, her back to Lily.</p>
<p>Lily lifted her head up in puzzlement<i>, why is Miley telling me this? The last thing I want to do is think about was the two of them, Miley and Jake, together, and with a family…my nightmare.</i></p>
<p>"Lily, if you had a child, would you want a boy or a girl?"</p>
<p>"A girl," was all Lily said in reply, she wanted to see where Miley was going with this.</p>
<p>"Me too, I'd name her Rose," Miley said quietly as she fingered the flowers sitting in the vase.</p>
<p>The two girls made eye contact for the first time since they had entered the room, and Lily saw tears in Miley's eyes. Lily saw her press her fist against her mouth, trying to hold back a sob that escaped anyways. Lily stood there frozen, <i>I want to hold Miley, and tell her everything will be alright but I'm afraid to touch her, like if I disturb her she'd merely disappear into the abyss and I would be left with my broken self. I guess all I can do is find out what she's trying to get at.</i></p>
<p>"Rose?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, Rose. It seems right, to name the second most beautiful girl in my life, the second most beautiful flower I've ever seen," Miley replied, glancing back at the vase of tranquil white roses.</p>
<p>Lily felt her head buzz from conflicting thoughts and her stomach do a flip-flop. She reached out a shaking hand towards the girl of her dreams and managed to let out a hoarse whisper, "Miley…"</p>
<p>Miley suddenly turned around and grabbed Lily's outstretched hand and leaned her head in close to Lily's, she could smell the sweet vanilla scent of Lily's perfume. Their foreheads rested against each other, the two girls' breath mixing. Miley entwined her fingers with the ones on Lily's hand that she grasped so tightly. Lily reached up with her other hand to wipe away the tear that had escaped Miley's right eye but Miley suddenly closed the little space that had separated their lips and sealed Lily's lips with a searing kiss.</p>
<p>Lily's hand that was suspended in the air from being detoured from its original task instead went to tangle itself in Miley's luscious wavy hair. Miley let out a slight moan from the tingles going down her spine when Lily used her fingernails to lightly rake Miley's scalp.</p>
<p>The pair of lovebirds reluctantly separated in need of air, lungs on fire, lips tingling, and hearts singing. They both smiled and embraced each other, delicately as if the other was made of glass.</p>
<p>"Lily…sweet Lily, how could I be so blind?" Miley whispered into Lily's silky blonde hair.</p>
<p>"Miley, forgive me, I could see my love for you but I failed to voice my own confession. I love you, Miley, my Miley, I love you with all my heart," Lily cried out, leaning back to look into Miley's eyes, trying to convey all the emotions that Lily had bottled up inside for years.</p>
<p>"What!" screamed a voice from the doorway, the girls broke the embrace and stared at the intruder.</p>
<p><i>Crap, this is not good.</i></p>
