<!-- Blood \ Chapter 1 -->

<P>Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres could feel her heart pounding in her hears, that sound only interrupted by the irregular gasps that were escaping her lips. Her boots thudded on deck plating as she ran down darkened corridors. The halls of Voyager were empty and dark, casting the sounds back at her as empty echoes. Part of her wanted to fight back, find help, do something, but all she could do was flee. Try to out pace the one chasing her. IT was only one person, B'Elanna was as sure of that as she was she needed to get away. Even though her pursuer could be felt they were not allowing themselves to be seen, and it was driving B'Elanna mad.  </P>
<P>What was causing the blood to pound even harder was not the fear, but the frustration. The halls were not laid out right! Every time she tried to find a room there was a wall. There was the occasional doorway but she knew they would not be able to help her. The important ones like engineering, her quarters, Tom's quarters were simply not there.  She thought she might be lost so she accessed the computer, but it had no power. With a growl of frustration her first hit the panel. Then she thought something could be wrong with Voyager, that perhaps something was warping the ship lie an encounter with an anomaly that turned out to be a species. That didn't explain why she couldn't find anybody, but all those thoughts vanished as she felt her hunter come near.</P>
<P>Her breathing stopped and she found herself slinking against the wall, though she didn't know if it was to attack or to hide. The commbadge on her chest had proven useless early on and there was no hesitation as she took it off and hurled it away. As the metallic clink reached her ears she was trying to slink in the opposite direction, but when she hear footsteps coming right at her she knew it failed. Gathering her feet underneath her she ran headlong down the corridors. No thoughts of stealth or subtlety just distance. Yet the steady sharp sounds of her pursuer's footfalls never broke stride and never seemed to fade.</P>
<P>Until they stopped all together. While part of her mind screamed to keep running, Torres stopped as well. Her lungs were straining so hard that they refused to stop breathing so she had to settle for making the needed breaths short and soft, but they were the only sound in the air. Slowly, ever so slowly she started to move, almost as if she expected some unseen weapon to cut her down at any moment. Strangely it helped, drawing upon her Starfleet training and Maquis experience left her feeling more in control of the situation, until she turned that corner.  While she had been looking for a member of the crew Seven of Nine was the last one she wanted to see.</P>
<P>In typical form Seven appeared detached. That was until B'Elanna looked into those normally ice cold eyes. No one could call them cold. They were intense, passionate, yet they still had that Borg focus, and that Borg focus was directed at her. They left her feeling vulnerable, weak, frightened, and she realized her hunter was a huntress and was standing before her. Turning to run Seven stepped forward. "You are efficient." B'Elanna couldn't help but look confusedly over her shoulder, and that was her last mistake. One human arm and one cybernetic darted out to grab her own. While she tried to struggle she found both arms inhumanly powerful. </P>
<P>Her chest was heaving with her attempts to escape, but as she looked closely she saw Seven's was as well. When she looked into those impossibly blue eyes again she found her strength leave her. Seven seemed to sense as much and pressed B'Elanna's back to the corridor wall behind them. Her hands were pressed against the same surface as Seven stepped close/ The woman's body was warm through her biosuit and the texture provided by the occasional implant made an amazing contrast to the otherwise soft, smooth fabric. With out even thinking B'Elanna's body pressed into the contact, grinding her own flesh against Seven's. As she looked up once more she saw those eyes looking at her, and burning with more passion then B'Elanna had ever seen, let alone felt.</P>
<P>Again with out any thought on her part she raised her cheek, baring it to her captor. Full pink lips moved close, and as she spoke Torres could feel it like a phantom caress over her cheek. "You are efficient, you will make an excellent mate." Then she felt the bite, but there was no shock, and very little pain. Just enough to make her body arch and while she cried out it was not from that pain. It was pleasure, joy, giving herself to one strong enough to claim her. Where her body had once struggled it now let go, resting into the contact. As she ceased resistance she felt a tongue lick at the wound cleaning it, and as she sat upright in bed she swore she could still feel it.</P>
