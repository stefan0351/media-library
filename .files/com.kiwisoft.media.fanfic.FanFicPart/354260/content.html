<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 19: Surprises -->

<P>Word spread quickly through <I>Voyager’s</I> grapevine that the two missing
crewmembers were back, but there were only faint rumblings about how the two may
or may not have gotten along.</P><I>
<P>Voyager</I> got underway without a hitch, and much to Janeway’s relief she
was able to return to her ready room for some much needed alone time. So far,
she and the Doctor were the only two on board who knew about B’Elanna and
Seven’s marriage and impending child, but the juicy piece of gossip would make
the rounds soon enough. The captain didn’t care to discuss it with anyone, so
she was less than thrilled to hear the chime of her door disturb her quiet
contemplation.</P>
<P>"Come in," Janeway said unenthusiastically.</P>
<P>Tuvok entered and walked directly to her desk without a word. She waited
until he stood at attention and then raised her eyebrows in silence question.
When he merely shifted his weight, she switched tactics.</P>
<P>"Yes?" she asked.</P>
<P>"I came to ask if you have come to any resolution regarding your personal
matter," he said the last two words as if they were actually painful.</P>
<P>"Didn’t give me much time, did you, old friend?" She leaned back in her chair
and motioned to the chair beside him with a nod of her head.</P>
<P>"You have seen her. From all accounts, she is well," he said as if that
explained everything.</P>
<P>"Yes, she’s quite well," Janeway said with bitterness hardening her
words.</P>
<P>"I would think her well being would be a cause for relief," he said. He
really did not enjoy trying to decipher human emotions. Just when he thought he
had a firm grasp on them, they darted off in the most illogical direction
available. </P>
<P>Kathryn looked down at her hands that were resting on top of her desk, then
looked up. Her command mask was down, something she wouldn’t allow with any
other member of the crew.</P>
<P>"Captain?" The depth of despair Tuvok saw disturb him.</P>
<P>"She’s married, Tuvok." Her eyes went back down to her own hands, to the ring
finger, devoid of any decoration, the naked digit mocking her. Even while she
had been engaged to Mark, she had never worn a ring, adhering to the letter
Starfleet policy, although most captains allowed their crew to wear wedding
bands. </P>
<P>"To Lieutenant Torres, I presume?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Kathryn responded, though she wondered why it had occurred to him so
quickly. "Did you see this coming?"</P>
<P>"Their bonding was one of the many possible variables," he said slowly. "I
had considered that the animosity they harbored on board might have been sexual
tension. I felt mentioning it prior to this would have caused you undo stress
given the fact that we had no way of knowing what was going on."</P>
<P>"Well," Janeway said as she stood and walked to the window, studying the
stars whipping by. "I think it’s pretty clear the matter is closed."</P>
<P>"Were you a Vulcan, I would agree." Tuvok stood and went to stand next to the
captain and studied the flying specks that were stars outside the warp field.
"However, you are not Vulcan."</P>
<P>"Other than stating out the obvious, do you have a point?" Kathryn eyed the
dark skinned Vulcan with a sideways glance.</P>
<P>"My point, is that since you are human, the knowledge that Seven is
unattainable will not make you want her any less." Tuvok linked his hands behind
his back and continued staring out the window. "In fact, given your nature,
Captain, it may make you want her more."</P>
<P>"Me in general, or all us flawed humans?" Janeway turned to face him.</P>
<P>"You are a particularly competitive person, Captain. It has served you well.
It is one of the things that makes you such a great captain." He turned and
tilted his head to one side. "It is also the thing that concerns me in this
situation."</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway asked. She was less than amused. "Are you worried I’ll
challenge B’Elanna to a duel for Seven’s hand?"</P>
<P>"Vulcans do not worry," he said. "Additionally, I know you well enough to
know that such an action would not be in your nature. I also know Seven well
enough to know that she would not allow such a contest," he added in case the
captain surprised him and was actually considering that option.</P>
<P>"And just what would be in my nature?" Her voice rumbled quietly.</P>
<P>"You would not interfere in another person’s relationship, however I am
concerned that you will become increasingly forlorn. You do not like losing," he
explained.</P>
<P>"This isn’t a game, Tuvok."</P>
<P>"No, but when Ransom had Seven in his custody, your actions were illogical. I
believe part of that was your need to beat Ransom, and part of it was that he
stole what you saw as yours," Tuvok stated bluntly. "That may intensify your
sense of loss in this case."</P>
<P>"He did had our containment matrix," Janeway said defensively.</P>
<P>"I was referring to Seven of Nine." He raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"I do not consider her property." Janeway’s eyes flashed and she straightened
to her full height, though she still only reached his chest. "And I resent you
suggesting otherwise."</P>
<P>"My intention is not to cause resentment, only to counsel you to refocus
your…affection." He looked down at her, showing as much concern as was possible
for the Vulcan.</P>
<P>Janeway laughed and walked away, her heart breaking. "Refocus my affection?
Tuvok," she said as she went to the couch and sat. "If only it were that
easy."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna studied Seven as the blonde slept. Seven had dozed off after they
had finished making love; the napping had only begun to happen since the
pregnancy. B’Elanna watched her wife’s lips twitch and her eyes shift under
closed lids as she dreamed. The Klingon smiled, unable to contain her joy. She
had everything she had ever dreamed possible…and more, a beautiful wife, a
daughter on the way, and now they were safely back on board <I>Voyager</I>. When
she had awakened in the Dengari surgical bay and seen <I>Voyager’s</I> Doctor,
she had thought she was hallucinating. Once he explained the temporal
differential, of course dragging in his own heroic away mission on a similar
planet, she had been relieved. Now that she was back on board, it finally hit
her what the time difference meant. She and Seven had each other and the baby,
while the ship had barely missed a beat of Kahless’ drum in the grand scheme.
She reached out and brushed a strand of blonde hair off of Seven’s face and
tucked it behind her ear. Seven mumbled, and shifted toward the Klingon, she had
an innate sense of B’Elanna’s presence, and would shift to be as close to her as
possible. B’Elanna loved the way Seven would make little frustrated sounds when
she couldn’t touch B’Elanna the way she wanted to, tiny whimpers that she would
continue until she rolled over and found B’Elanna, then she would let out a
contented sigh and begin nuzzling into B’Elanna’s neck. B’Elanna thought it was
the most adorable thing she had ever seen. She hoped their daughter inherited
the tiny whimpers.</P>
<P>B’Elanna lifted the covers and slipped out of the bed, standing for several
minutes just watching Seven. Finally, she bent down and placed a tender kiss on
her wife’s temple, running her hand through Seven’s hair that was down and
flowing across the pillow. She left the former drone to rest and went into the
living area. She had grown accustom to clothing being optional, and she didn’t
even register her lack of attire until she sat on the couch and realized that
she was somewhat underdressed and smiled as she retrieved her robe. She wanted
to start designing a portable regenerator to move into her quarters so that
Seven wouldn’t have to spend time in the cargo bay.</P>
<P>The Klingon found that being away from <I>Voyager</I> for two and a half
years had left her technical skills a bit rusty. She had to actually pull the
ship’s schematics before working out the best way to move a smaller version of
the alcove to her quarters. It was frustrating, she remembered when she could
have rerouted any system in her head, every circuit and relay embedded in her
memory, and she didn’t like needing to rely on data padds to tell her where the
nearest power conduits were. </P>
<P>The door chimed and she looked up from the three padds on her lap. She got up
and hurried to the door not wanting whoever it was to chime again which might
wake up Seven.</P>
<P>She opened the door and saw red, literally. Two dozen roses blocked her view,
the roses lowered and Tom Paris smiled and did his best to look charming.</P>
<P>"Tom, what do you want?" B’Elanna asked as she leaned against the wall,
blocking his entry. </P>
<P>"Lana, welcome home," he said and stepped forward.</P>
<P>"Paris? What is it?" B’Elanna reached across the doorway using her arm as a
barricade before he could enter.</P>
<P>"Come on, Lana, you can’t still be angry." He moved to the other side of
B’Elanna to get past her. "I’m sorry, all right? If you’re still mad after all
this time, you must still care. Why don’t you let me come in and give you a
proper welcome home?"</P>
<P>"Tom, look, I’m not mad at you. Honestly, I haven’t thought much about you at
all." She shifted her weight and crossed her arms over her chest. "I need to
talk to you, but this really isn’t a good time."</P>
<P>"Come on, Lana, it’s the perfect time." He rushed past her and into the room,
stopping when he saw the padds scattered across the couch. "Back to work so
soon? You need to relax," he said. "Computer, lights one half." </P>
<P>The illumination lowered and Tom tossed the roses onto the couch. "I know
you’ve missed me," he insisted. "Come on." He moved closer and she had to
backpedal to stay out of his reach.</P>
<P>"Tom, leave, now." She continued backing away. "Or I’m gonna’ enjoy giving
you a nice bit of news."</P>
<P>"Oh?" he asked as he came closer, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.</P>
<P>"Tom, I’m married." She stood her ground and glared at him. "So I suggest you
leave now before things get really ugly." Her lips curled up at the edges
revealing her pointed teeth. It wasn’t a smile.</P>
<P>"Married?" Tom asked. "Come on, Lana, you can do better than that." He looked
around her quarters, pointing at the mostly empty room. "I don’t see any prince
charming. Lana, if you want me to beg I will, but just give me a chance."</P>
<P>"Paris," B’Elanna sighed and rubbed her temples, wanting him out before Seven
woke up. After the fiasco with the way had Janeway found out, she didn’t want
the same thing to happen with Tom. True, he was a jerk, but she didn’t want to
see him hurt, embarrassed maybe, but not hurt. "Leave, Tom. I’m happy, and you
don’t hold a candle to my…"</P>
<P>"Your husband?" Tom asked, then laughed. "Please." He laughed and tugged at
the collar of her robe. She grabbed his arm and twisted him around, trapping his
arm behind him and pushing toward the door. </P>
<P>"Go try this crap with your hologram, Tom," B’Elanna said as she shoved him
away from her.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, even if you did meet someone, you know it’s me you want," he
challenged. "You probably picked some guy who looks just like me, didn’t
you?"</P>
<P>"No," came the sultry voice from behind him. </P>
<P>He turned and saw Seven leaning against the bedroom door with one of
B’Elanna’s tunics held to her body, covering her, well, covering some of her.
</P>
<P>"Seven?" Tom’s voice squeaked.</P>
<P>"You remember me. I am honored… I thought five days was beyond the capacity
of your limited memory," Seven said sarcastically. The tunic had been hanging on
the wall and Seven had grabbed it before coming out when she had heard voices.
The uniform top hid her breasts, and down past her waist, but it revealed her
long expanse of legs on the bottom and her abundant cleavage on top. Luckily her
hair was cascading down on both sides of her face, helping to keep her breasts
from view.</P>
<P>"No way," Paris said. He couldn’t believe B’Elanna would dump him for the
Borg ice queen, although he was enjoying the view in front of him.</P>
<P>"Get out," B’Elanna said as she walked passed him and into the bedroom. She
came back out with a sheet and draped it around Seven from behind, leaving her
arms around the tall blonde. "I’m happy, Tom. Just move on." Her cheek was
resting against Seven’s shoulder. She hadn’t wanted to rub her happiness in his
face, but he just made it so easy.</P>
<P>"But, but… we, we had something," he insisted.</P>
<P>"<I>Had</I>, Tom," B’Elanna said as she rubbed her wife’s arms. "And what we
had doesn’t hold a candle to what Seven and I have." She looked at Tom, feeling
sorry for the inept fool. "Tom, go home."</P>
<P>He continued staring, too stunned to speak.</P>
<P>Seven shifted so that she had her arms cradled over the top of B’Elanna’s.
"My wife asked you to leave our quarters, Ensign Paris," Seven said calmly. "Do
not make her ask again."</P>
<P>"Or what?" he asked as he stepped forward, his shock overruling his natural
instinct for self-preservation.</P>
<P>B’Elanna tensed, but Seven had her arms pinned around her waist and the
sheet. The Klingon remembered the nauseating sound of the breaking necks in the
holding cell and realized that she should get Tom out of the room.</P>
<P>"Or, I will remove you," Seven said. Her voice was calm, but had the sharp
edge of rage making the air crackle. Her eyes narrowed and she raised the
eyebrow under her implant. "I do not wish to do so. You are a competent pilot
and it would be a shame for you to be confined to sickbay…indefinitely."</P>
<P>Tom was about to make a snide comment that would get him an all expenses paid
emergency transport to sickbay with a complimentary painkiller, but he saw
B’Elanna squeeze and then soothe Seven. Something in the way Seven’s muscles
rippled beneath her skin, like a cat before it pounces, made him hesitate.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," the Klingon whispered as she lifted onto her toes to reach Seven’s
ear. "He’s not worth it. Please, let me handle this." She left a kiss on the
soft pink shell of Seven’s ear to convince the exdrone.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven whispered back, tilting her face toward B’Elanna so that
their cheeks touched. </P>
<P>B’Elanna walked passed Tom, grabbed the roses, then went back and yanked him
by the arm toward the door. "I just saved your ass, Paris. You owe me," she said
as she shoved him out the door and tossed the roses out after him.</P>
<P>"This isn’t over, Borg," he said as the door slid shut cutting off his
pigheaded taunt.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Those onboard who considered B’Elanna Torres to be the supreme source of
gossip on <I>Voyager</I> had never seen Tom Paris at the top of his informative
game. Twelve minutes after he left B’Elanna’s quarters, every member of the crew
knew about the marriage of the resident Klingon to the Borg drone. Tom had
expected surprise, which he got in abundance, but the sense of outrage he wanted
was not to be had. While everyone seemed surprised, most passed it off as none
of their business, or worse in Tom’s mind, they were happy for the pair. The
only one on board who actually seemed disturbed by the news was young Naomi
Wildman who had been with Neelix when he heard the news.</P>
<P>"Wonderful, just wonderful," the furry chef and sometimes diplomat said as he
rubbed his yellow spotted hands together. "I’ll get to work on a reception right
away." He grabbed a padd from his kitchen counter and began accessing files.</P>
<P>"Is that all you’re gonna’ say?" asked Tom. </P>
<P>"Well, what else would I say?" Neelix asked, honestly confused by the
question. He looked down at Naomi who was standing beside him and noticed her
confused expression. "Naomi, honey? What is it?"</P>
<P>She tugged on the Talaxian’s sleeve and brought him down to her level to
whisper a question in his ear. "I thought Seven liked the captain?" she asked
with the innocence of youth.</P>
<P>He frowned, then smiled indulgently at the child. "No, dear. I don’t think
so."</P>
<P>"Neelix?" Tom persisted. "Aren’t you the least bit shocked? I mean…this is
B’Elanna…and Seven."</P>
<P>"Love comes in every mix, Mister Paris. Just look at what Kes and I shared.
Who would have thought such a delicate flower could have loved an old hedgehog
like me?" Neelix noticed Tom avoid his glance. "Yes, Tom, I know what some of
the crew calls me. I kind of like it. Hedgehogs are very handsome animals."</P>
<P>Naomi giggled as she realized how much Neelix did look like the pictures she
had seen of hedgehogs. Her giggles changed to a squeal when the giant hedgehog
in question bent down and snorted at her and then rooted around her neck.</P>
<P>"Well, uh," Tom said with a sigh. "I have to go," he said as he turned and
fled the mess hall to continue spreading the juiciest piece of gossip on board
in years.</P>
<P>Neelix waved to the Ensign as he left then gave Naomi his full attention.
"Now then, Miss Wildman, I’m going to need an assistant to plan a wedding
reception, and as one of Seven’s best friends, that responsibility would usually
fall onto you. Are you up for it?"</P>
<P>"Yes," she answered, her tiny face completely serious about the grave
responsibility she was being given.</P>
<P>"All right then," he said as he looked over his padd. "I’m pretty sure I can
find some information on Klingon and human rituals, but I’m not sure there will
be anything on Borg joinings."</P>
<P>"The Borg don’t join, Neelix." Naomi said as she gave him a tolerant smile.
"They assimilate."</P>
<P>"Well, that wouldn’t be much fun at a reception, now would it?" he asked as
he rubbed his chin with mock seriousness. "We can’t have the guests sprouting
implants, that would ruin their tuxedos."</P>
<P>Naomi giggled and rolled her eyes.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Captain to the bridge," Chakotay’s voice said over the communication system.
Janeway looked up from the padd on her desk and stood, making her way out of the
ready room and toward the bridge. She came through the doors and looked up to
the viewscreen at one of the biggest warships she had ever seen.</P>
<P>"Report," she demanded as she took her seat.</P>
<P>"Captain, that warship just came up behind us and is matching our course.
We’ve changed our heading twice and they’ve adjusted to match us each time,"
Chakotay explained. He rubbed the tattoo over his eye as he stared at the
viewscreen.</P>
<P>"Have you hailed them?" Janeway asked Ensign Kim who was currently standing
at the Ops station.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am. Four times, no response." He checked his comm panel even as he
spoke to make sure he didn’t miss some vital bit of information.</P>
<P>"Open hailing frequencies," she ordered.</P>
<P>"Open," Harry said as he tapped the keypad in front of him. </P>
<P>"This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship <I>Voyager</I>,
please state your intentions." She didn’t want to start out being rude.</P>
<P>"They’re responding," Harry said, his surprise evident. The viewscreen image
changed to show a Dengari man with graying temples sitting in an overstated
command chair that had intricate carvings and large swirling armrests.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, are you in the habit of having your underlings greet
dignitaries?" the man asked. His tone was a mix of disgust and concern.</P>
<P>"I’m not in the habit of explaining my actions to strangers," she responded
dryly.</P>
<P>"I am the Magistrate," he said, offend she didn’t recognize him.</P>
<P>"That explains the chair," she said quietly to Chakotay who choked down a
laugh. "What can I do for you, Magistrate?" she asked cautiously.</P>
<P>"Return my two prisoners," he said casually, then actually bent his fingers
and examined his fingernails.</P>
<P>"We don’t have any of your prisoners." Janeway stood and put her hands on her
hips. "The members of my crew that were in your custody finished their
sentences."</P>
<P>"Yes, but they killed two men on board the transport ship." He stood as well,
but leaned against the massive chair in a relaxed manner. "I have generously
agreed to not consider them fugitives. Normally I would interpret their leaving
as another crime, but the Overseer convinced me to show leniency."</P>
<P>"Those men were trying to kill them," Janeway said. "Don’t you know anything
about self-defense?" her voice sounded like she had swallowed gravel, deep and
reverberating, mimicking a mother bear’s growl, a perfect measure of her
mood.</P>
<P>"Of course," he said. "We are a civilized species. Had in the prisoners
remained until my arrival, I would have given them a complete pardon on those
grounds." He sat down and griped the ornate arms of his chair. "But since they
left, undermining my authority, I had no choice but to find them guilty of
murder. I want them transferred to my custody at once."</P>
<P>"I don’t think so." Janeway sat in her chair and tossed one leg over the
other. "Tuvok, yellow alert."</P>
<P>"This needn’t be an adversarial discussion," he said, but his eyes said the
opposite.</P>
<P>"Too late," Janeway said. "You might as well turn around and go home. You
won’t get my people."</P>
<P>His eyes narrowed, then he looked off screen and nodded. The Overseer walked
into the screen.</P>
<P>"Captain, I think we can work this out… to all our satisfaction. If you would
just come over to our ship with the prisoners, we can work this out."</P>
<P>"Overseer, since the day I met you, every word out of your mouth has been a
half truth or an outright lie. You’ll forgive me if I don’t trust you," Janeway
said.</P>
<P>"Yes, I will," the Overseer said and smiled. She looked at the Magistrate.
"Perhaps we could meet on their ship?"</P>
<P>"That is highly irregular," the Magistrate said.</P>
<P>"Irregular or not, I would be willing to allow you and the Overseer to come
on board. However, my ship will handle the transport, and your ship will have to
take its weapons and transporters off line." Janeway steepled her fingers
together and let the ball shoot into their court.</P>
<P>"Am I supposed to come over there without a security team?" He asked, clearly
not willing to making the agreement without some petty concession on Janeway’s
part.</P>
<P>"I think I can let you bring one guard... unarmed," the captain said. She
rather enjoyed demanding her own petty concession from the pompous
magistrate.</P>
<P>The Overseer cleared her throat. "I’m sure my captain of the guard would be
honored to accompany the Magistrate," she said.</P>
<P>"Very well," the Magistrate said. "In one standard hour," he decreed.</P>
<P>"Why don’t we make it two. I have an urgent matter to attend," Janeway said.
The urgent matter was taking some of the wind out of the Magistrate’s sail.</P>
<P>"I will allow it," the Magistrate said as if he was the one in control all
along.</P>
<P>"Fine, my security chief will contact your people, Janeway out," she said as
she disengaged the channel from her comm panel. "Tuvok, I want the ship on full
alert until further notice."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The entire senior staff was present in the conference room, scattered around
the table. All eyes darted back and forth between the Klingon and the exBorg,
except for Tom, whose eyes were locked on Seven. She was unaffected by his
attempt at intimidation. She had faced down the Borg Queen, so Tom Paris’
childish attempts to unsettle her were actually amusing.</P>
<P>The senior staff had almost concluded their brief meeting when the question
of whether or not Torres and Seven would meet with the Magistrate came up.</P>
<P>"Oh, I’ll meet with him," B’Elanna said to Janeway with a menacing smile. "In
fact, maybe he and I should spend a little quality time alone."</P>
<P>"Somehow," Seven said, "I do not think he would enjoy the quality of the
visit you have in mind." The exdrone moved her chair closer to B’Elanna and
lifted an eyebrow high onto her forehead. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Janeway said, "as satisfying as that would be...for all of us,
I don’t think it’s going to happen." The captain glanced around the table and
then cleared her throat. "Now, I think we should focus on preparing, and we need
to hurry so that we have options."</P>
<P>The Doctor leaned forward. "Well, giving B’Elanna and Seven to them isn’t an
option," he said, pointing out the obvious, a task usually handled by
Chakotay.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said within an unamused crinkle of her brow.</P>
<P>Tom finally spoke. "Well, from what I read in the report, both of them did
not kill those men."</P>
<P>"You are correct, Mr. Paris," Seven said. Her hand reached under the table
and squeezed B’Elanna’s convincing the Klingon by hold her tongue. Seven
continued. "I killed them, Mr. Paris. They hurt my wife, and I dealt with them."
She leveled her lapis blue eyes on the Helmsman.</P>
<P>"You acted in self-defense," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Tuvok, I need you to make sure there aren’t any surprises when they arrive."
Janeway looked around the table. "As for the rest of you, make sure your
departments are on their toes. Tuvok has some special instructions for each of
you." She pushed her chair away from the table. "I think we’re done here."</P>
