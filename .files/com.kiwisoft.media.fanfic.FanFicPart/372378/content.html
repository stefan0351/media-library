<P>A.N. I'm really on a roll with this story lol, here's chapter 3!</P><P><U>Closer When Dreaming â€“ Chapter Three</U></P><P>We had been living in this apartment for ten days. That's ten days with Miley and ten nights without her. I've not gone as long as this without having a sleepover with Miley and was starting to feel the side effects. That thing people say about the best way to quit an addiction is to go cold turkey? Yeah, they obviously never had an addiction like mine. For the first few nights I slept ok but then over the last week I haven't been sleeping much at all. Finally on the eleventh night, I'd had enough. I get out of bed and silently walked down the hall to Miley's room. I take a deep breath as I push open the door and there is my Miley. Fast asleep, with no disturbing addictions to keep her awake. I walk over to her bed and sit beside her sleeping form and before I can stop myself I reach forward and gently trace her jaw line with my finger and there's the beautiful smile she only gives when she's asleep. I lie down gently next to her, on my side so I can face her and I look into the sleeping face. She has to be the most beautiful person especially when she sleeps. All the stress and worry she has over her life as Hannah and her school work vanishes, leaving her looking completely relaxed and happy.</P><P>I lie there for a good half an hour and finally decide that I need to try and get some sleep as I'm nodding off as I lie there but I'm so exhausted that as I start getting up I have to counter balance my weight with my arm and accidentally graze Miley's outer thigh. I freeze as Miley curls into my side and I start to panic. I can't believe I did that! She'll wake up in the morning and freak out that I'm here. I try to calm myself down and gently ease out of her embrace but she only tightens her grip and cuddles closer into my side. I try one more time to leave her embrace but my will to leave vanishes the instant she whispers <I>"Lilly"</I> in her sleep and kisses my collarbone. I'm a goner and I know it but if tomorrow means that Miley is going to freak out and demand I leave then I sure as hell am going to enjoy her being in my arms one last time.</P><P>However the next morning, Miley merely smiled at me and squeezed me gently before getting out of bed and walking into her bathroom. I wasn't still in bed when she had finished in the shower. That night I didn't dare get closer to Miley than the door, but I watched her sleep talk and then sleep for a while before returning to bed. This pattern continued for the next few nights and although I was finally getting some sleep but the guilt was gnawing away at my insides and I finally decided that I was going to stay put no matter how tired I got. When I fell asleep I had the most awful nightmare. Miley was there and she was disgusted with me telling me awful things, the exact opposite of the things I had heard during her sleep talks.</P><P>These nightmares continued for the next few nights until one morning I woke up to find that Miley had got into my bed in the middle of the night. Waking up with her in my arms when I hadn't initiated it was the most wonderful feeling. She was already awake and just smiled at me again like she had that first morning I had woken in her arms and told me she missed sleeping next to me. <I>She </I>missed sleeping next to <I>me</I>. I was ecstatic and didn't bother wondering what this meant.</P><P>From that night on one of us would always end up in the other's room after one had fallen to sleep. Most nights it was me going into Miley's room because I wanted to hear her sleep talking but some mornings I'd wake up in my bed with Miley cuddled into my side. I didn't really understand why the two of us both seemed to be unable to rest easy without the other one next to us but that was the way it was happening. Well ... I understood what was happening with me but Miley? Now that was a different question.</P><P>For the first time since I had first heard Miley's sleep talk about how she loved me, hope flared brightly in my chest. Maybe her subconscious revelation was how she consciously felt as well. But then why was she always acting just friendly around me during the day? Did she worry the same as I did about my reaction as I did hers? No surely not, Miley was always one of those people who just went for what she wanted.</P><P>This continued for a good few months. We settled into our lives at college and Miley and I were still really busy with our lives as Hannah and Lola. Although Miley had told her fans that she would be at least halving the amount of concerts and appearances she would be doing during her time at college she just couldn't put aside Hannah completely. Her love of performing and singing as a huge part of her so I told her I'd go to all of them with her. When I lived at my Mom's house, I would really only go to concerts and certain appearances like the Mac and Mickey show but now I lived with Miley it was just as easy to go with her. She had been worried that I would spend too much time helping her with Hannah and not enough on my work but I told her she was being silly. She still managed to do all her work with all the Hannah work. Then one night after we had come back from a charity concert, I was lay in bed reading a book for my English Literature class when Miley wandered into my room and without a word she slid under the covers next to me and cuddled into my side. Without a thought about it my arm wrapped itself around her shoulders and I continued to read with a small smile on my face.</P><P>From that night onwards she always came into my room after we had both got ready for bed.</P><P>Over time, little things that belonged to her started to migrate into my room too. Her hairbrush was next to mine on the dressing table, her current book for her business class was on the bedside table next to her side of the bed and she had commandeered one of the smaller drawers in my dresser for things like pyjamas and a few t-shirts and skirts for if she was in a rush in the morning. She had made that mistake only once, my alarm had been set for my slightly later class and hers was first thing. She had jumped out of bed with half an hour left to go before the class started and had run around like a mad woman trying to get ready on time. After she had gone, I emptied the drawer so she could put things in it.</P><P>A few months after this, we had been to see our parents in Malibu and we had gone back to the beach for old time's sake and there was this guy who had hit on Miley repeatedly. She had not rebuffed his advances and had seemed to quite enjoy flirting with him and although she hadn't given him her number, I knew a day would come soon where she would be dating a guy and he would stay over. We could hardly share our bed like this then. I lay awake that night, holding Miley securely to me and felt my mind racing. I knew I had to tell her soon, it couldn't be avoided any longer.</P><P>The next day I woke up first which isn't a usual occurrence for us. Miley always seemed to be awake first even if she loved to lounge in bed before getting up. I looked at her face and did something I had only been bold enough to do a few times. I leaned forward and placed a gentle kiss on her lips, closing my eyes as I did.</P><P>"I love you" I whispered, as I pulled back before opening my eyes to stare into the blue of Miley's.</P><P>... Shit.</P><P>A.N. Up next is Miley's pov, please review, thanks Nicki xoxo</P>
