<!-- Inside Out Loud \ Story -->

<P>I’m not really sure how it happened or
when. I guess studying has always come
naturally to me. I’ve always been the brain
and had an affinity towards higher
learning. I got into like a bazillion
colleges. They wooed me senior year. They
pitched woo to me. But, I chose to got to the
local college, mostly because she was going to be
there. Crazy, right? You wouldn’t
think so if you knew her and everything that she stands
for. She’s been my rock and I can’t really
remember what it was like when she wasn’t
here. I suppose it was like I was living in
black and white . . .going to class, studying, pining
after Xander, studying some more. Then she
transferred and we met and just clicked. Now
I’ve been living in techni-color. So where
was I? Oh, yeah. . . studying. So
I’ve been studying her a lot lately. Well, I
guess not lately . . .since we met
really. She’s a tough egg to
crack. She’s so tough and strong sometimes . . .then a little vulnerability leaks out and my world
goes all askew. She’s made me a better person
. . . hell, she’s made me more of a person in
general. I was always quiet, shy, and kind of
melted into the woodwork. Slowly but surely
she became my friend and all of a sudden I was like 3-D
Willow, I felt real. I know, you probably
think she’s too good to be true and that there isn’t
anyone in the world that deserves that much
credit. Believe me , she does. So
I’ve run across a problem now. Oz left and
I’m dealing, Angel left and she’s
dealing. We’re pretty much getting along with
out them. See now, that’s the
thing. We’re with out them. No
men. And we’re roomies as in living together
in the dorms. So I’ve found myself studying
her more and more lately and I can’t help but think
there has to be something wrong with
it. Right? I mean, I’m not gay as
in liking girls . . .that’s not me, no sirry bob, nope,
I like men, manly men that lift and sweat and are kind
of muscley and . . .okay, I’m babbling. So
I’m definitely not THAT but I find myself, well, drawn
to her. Maybe even attracted. I
mean, who wouldn’t be. She’s got the most
mesmerizing eyes, and the way her lip curls when she
smiles is like wow and her figure, God, to have half the
body she has and her hair, please, I didn’t think
anything could ever be that soft. Yeah,
babbling again . . .but in a good way. So I
went to Giles today and told him that I was confused
about a lot of things in my life. We had a
great talk really, and he told me that things get sorted
out better when he writes them down. Sort of
like a stream of consciousness thing where you write
down everything and anything that comes to mind. So
that’s what I’m doing, but the only thing that comes to
mind is her. She’s out now, slaying some
vampires or smashing demons, so it’s
safe. She won’t be back for another hour
yet. So here I sit, on her bed with my
laptop, and I’m just writing away. I’m a
writing machine, really. I sit here sometimes
when she’s out. It probably sounds really
psycho and that I need to get my head checked but I
can’t help it. This is her, compacted into a
six by eight space, and I can’t help myself
really. Sick? No, actually it’s
quite comforting. I just sounded like
Giles. When she’s out I worry about
her. She could get hurt or killed or bleed or
something horrible. So I sit here and I get
under her covers and it kind of smells like her . . .and
it’s comforting. It’s like when you go to
your grandmother’s house and it has that certain smell .
. .you know that grandma smell. Well, over
here it’s a Buffyish smell. It smells like
Buffy, like she was just here. Where was I
again? Yeah, so we’re without men . .
.manless really and I can’t help but think that I should
do something, take the initiative. But so
many other things come into play like; will she feel the
same? Will people make fun of
us? What about Xander? What about
Oz and Angel for that matter? I’ve got all
these questions that need to be answered but I know I’m
way too chicken to look for the answers. I
can’t, there’s too much to risk. Right? What
if she runs screaming in the opposite direction or hates
me or doesn’t feel the same or tries to stake me or
something? Then I think that it could be
easy, I mean, I could make it easy. Buffy
always said I should use my powers for
good. This is for good, isn’t
it? What if I did a teeny weeny little truth
spell on both of us? What could it
hurt? Friends are supposed to be honest with
each other. . . I could just make SURE of the honesty
factor. Heck, I could even tell her about it
. . . like an experiment or something. She’s
always willing to help me out with my Wicca
studies. So maybe that’s what I should
do. It sounds like the easiest way out and I
won’t be hurting anyone. I’ll have to run
over to Giles’ house tomorrow and bring him some British
tea or something. This writing has really worked out
well.</p>

<HR>

<P>She crept in around 2 am leaving a wake of dust in
her path. There were three newly risen vamps
tonight and they were dispatched of quickly
enough. It always took them forever to get up
though, she must have made it around the cemetery six
times before the slayer sense kicked in. She
looked over at the other side of the room and saw red
hair protruding from beneath a warm
comforter. &lt;Looks like all is well on the
home front.&gt; Quietly, she changed into a
long t-shirt and made her way over to Willow’s bed.</p>

<p>"Wake up sleepy head." She jostled her a
bit, trying not to scare her.</p>

<p>"Hmm? Oh, Buffy….good slayage?"</p>

<p>Buffy noticed a hint of emerald green peek out from
under her eyelashes and smiled. "Good
slayage, Will. They took forever to rise
though, guess their parents never taught them about
punctuality."</p>

<p>This had become a routine for them since Willow had
become her roommate. Every night she’d come
in from slaying and Willow had insisted that she wake
her up so she knew she was alright.</p>

<p>Willow shifted in bed and patted the now empty spot
next to her. "Sit, tomorrow is Saturday and
we can sleep in."</p>

<p>Buffy crawled into bed and pulled up the
covers. "So how was your night?"</p>

<p>"Not bad. Finished my homework, checked my
mail. There’s nothing on T.V. Even
my favorite sci-fi show is hitting the repeat button and
there won’t be a new episode for two weeks
yet. I had an idea for another spell,
though. I’d like to try it
tomorrow." &lt;May as well get right to the
point.&gt;</p>

<p>"Goody, so what’s the plan this time? Rain
of frogs, hail of toads, turn Professor Walsh into a
rat?"</p>

<p>"You know I hate frogs and any form of reptile,
Buffy. And I can’t even de-rat Amy yet, so I
don’t think Professor Walsh would be very appreciative
of a shiny new wheel. Besides, I was thinking something
a little less complicated. Something I
haven’t tried before."</p>

<p>Now Buffy’s interest was piqued. "Come on,
spill. What is it? If you don’t
tell me I’m gonna have to resort to the tickle monster!"</p>

<p>Just thinking about it made Willow jump a
little. "Okay, okay . . .I was thinking about
trying a little truth spell."</p>

<p>"Hmm . . . has potential. Let’s do it on
Xander and find out if he REALLY doesn’t remember being
a hyena."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that could be fun. So we’ll talk about it more
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Buffy knew the question mark in her friends voice
meant that she was tired. "Sure, Will. I’m
gonna hit the sack now." She got up and went
over to her bed. "Nighty night."</p>

<HR>

<p>As usual, Buffy got up before Willow did at the crack
of dawn. She hopped out of bed and headed off
to the bathroom. &lt;Damn slayer
powers. Can’t even sleep till
noon.&gt; She came back, got dressed and
looked at the clock for what was probably the tenth
time. &lt;Hmm, <BR>8am. Will won’t
be up for another hour yet.&gt; She walked
over to Willow’s computer and booted it
up. &lt;She always said I could use it
anytime.&gt; After it booted, she noticed
that Willow had re-arranged things since the last time
she’d used it. Pushing what she thought was
the internet button, Buffy sat and waited for the little
connection box to come up but was instead met with a
saved document. &lt;Now what is
this?&gt; She began to skim the document.
&lt;Transferred? Techni-color? Studying
HER? What the hell?&gt;</p>

<p>"Buffy?"</p>

<p>She slammed the lid on the laptop
closed. "Will, I thought you were sleeping .
. . I, uh, I was just . . ."</p>

<p>"Snooping?" She gave her an incredulous
sleepy look from under a red mane.</p>

<p>"No. . . I mean, you said I could use it whenever I
wanted and I was just gonna go onto the internet."</p>

<p>"Oh, okay . . . that’s fine then." She
gave a little stretch. "So how long have you
been up?"</p>

<p>"About a half hour." Buffy noticed the skin peeking
out from the bottom of Willow’s pajama
top. "Uh, why don’t you get dressed and I’ll
go for bagels?"</p>

<p>"With veggie cream cheese?" Her eyes
widened.</p>

<p>"Your wish is my command. I’ll be back in
a few." With that, Buffy was out the door.</p>

<HR>

<p>&lt;Now that’s not something you see
everyday. I mean, Willow, thinking about a
girl And what’s this whole techi-color thing
about? I thought she totally freaked at the
thought of girl-girl action. I wonder who she
is. Maybe it’s that new witch,
Tara. That’s got to be it. We’ve
never seen her around before, she may have transferred
in. She’s not that pretty,
though. Willow could do much better that
that. I mean really, you can spot those roots
a mile away. She doesn’t look like she takes
very good care of herself either. Very frumpy
. . . full of frumpiness. God, what am I
saying? I sound jealous or something of this
Tara chick. Well, if it’s her she’d better
treat my Willow right or I’ll have to slay her ass . .
.Okay, that’s enough, Buffy. You can’t be
jealous every time Willow finds a new little
friend. . . who is so obviously
undeserving of . . .&gt;</p>

<p>"I said, can I help you miss?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh, two everything bagels toasted
with extra veggie cream cheese, and two coffee’s light
and sweet."</p>

<p>&lt;. . . her friendship in anyway. I
mean, to be Willow’s friend, you kinda have to be
special. You gotta have the it. I
really don’t think this girl has the it for Willow.
Seems like Willow’s got something for her
though. I wonder why she never told me about
it? How could she not tell me? I
guess she was really freaked out about her other self
from bizzaroland, so maybe she thought I’d be freaked
too. I’d be happy for her,
regardless. Guy, girl, werewolf . . .who
cares, as long as she’s happy. Look who’s
talking anyway . . . I had a vampire for a
boyfriend. It kinda creeps me out thinking
about some other girl touching her, kissing her . . .I
should be the one . . .NOT thinking about this,
definitely not thinking those thoughts or how soft her
lips are or her hair, mmmm soft, or how she
smells. . . STOP IT! Thinking naughty
thoughts about Willow should be declared a sin or
something I mean really . . .&gt;</p>

<p>"Hello? Earth to Buffy. .
." Willow was waving her hand in front of her
friends face.</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Since when did you turn into such a space
cadet? Did you run into some slimy demon
that’s got your tongue?" She furrowed her
brow in concern.</p>

<p>"No, I was just . . .Yeah, I guess I was really out
there, wasn’t I?"</p>

<p>"What’s wrong, Buffy?" She was getting
more and more concerned by the minute.</p>

<p>"Nothing really. I just . . .well, if you
had something really important to tell me, you would,
wouldn’t you? I mean like if you’ve met
someone or if you were confused about something or . .
.you know you can talk to me about anything, right
Will? I mean ANYTHING."</p>

<p>"Who died and put you into babble mode? Of
course I’d tell you if I met someone, which by the way,
is not the case. You’re my best friend,
Buffy, I can tell you anything." She smiled
for reassurance.</p>

<p>Buffy felt better. "Okay . . .bagel?"</p>

<p>They ate and watched Saturday morning cartoons
together. Buffy felt a little restless and
decided to go running and agreed to meet her back at the
dorm for dinner. They both decided to peek in
on their respective parents just to let them know they
were still alive. Buffy went shopping with
her mother and Willow found that her parents were out of
town, again.</p>

<HR>

<p>"Come on, Buffy. You have to
concentrate." Willow was getting
edgy. She just wanted this to go right and
her fidgety friend wasn’t making it any easier.</p>

<p>"It itches, Will. I want the cotton robe
next time."</p>

<p>"You have to wear that robe in order for it to
work. This one is for casting only . .
.unless of course you wanna cast the spell?"</p>

<p>"No, that’s your area, Will. I slayer, you
witch." She smiled and settled down again.</p>

<p>"Fine, here we go: I call to you, Gods and
Goddesses of the watchtower, protectors of the four
corners, hear my will. Each word that’s said
is bold and true, each word that’s thought is spoken
new. Let lies not settle in our ears, let
truth be spoken to quell our fears. Four and
twenty hours pass, twenty four hours so this
shall last. So mote it be." Willow
reached out and extinguished the candles in
order. She closed her eyes, took a cleansing
breath then looked over at Buffy.</p>

<p>"So, do you feel any different?"</p>

<p>"Not really. I think that incense stinks
though. I thought you were gonna do all your
spells in pine fresh scent?" Buffy wrinkled
up her nose as if to demonstrate her point.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well . . . it’s required for this type of
spell." She lowered her voice a little. "Are
you sure you don’t feel any
different.? Willow began to think the spell
didn’t work.</p>

<p>"Yes, I’m sure. God, Will, it’s so
annoying when you repeat yourself." Buffy’s
hand flew to her mouth. "Will, I’m sorry, I .
. .I don’t know why I said that . . .I"</p>

<p>Willow looked at her a little
shocked. "It’s okay, Buffy. I
guess it did work." She smiled and bounced a
little.</p>

<p>Yelling from outside their door stopped them from
continuing the conversation. They both got up
and ran over to see what was going on. Upon
opening the door, they were met with all of their dorm
mates screaming at each other in the hallway.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well I can’t stand it when you don’t put your
clothes away. Do you REALLY think the
doorknob was invented so you can hang your dirty
underwear on it!?"</p>

<p>"My toothbrush is not her to amuse
you. How could you do that? That’s
so gross . . .I’ll never be able to look at a toothbrush
again without getting all icked out with a seriously
disturbing visual!"</p>

<p>"…and keep your toenails off of my side of the
room. God, can you be anymore disgusting? I
get up to go to the bathroom and my feet get sliced by
your cast-offs!"</p>

<p>They looked at each other and shut the door.</p>

<p>"I guess it really, really worked! Let’s
get changed and go see Giles. He’ll know what
to do." Willow offered.</p>

<p>"Way to state the obvious, Will. Can’t you
do anything right without having Giles bail you
out?" Buffy’s head shot up to her
friend. This truth spell was gonna have to
get gone . . .and fast! "Will, I’m so sorry.
. . "</p>

<p>"Don’t worry about it, Buffy. I mean, you
were only telling the
truth. Right?" She understood, but
was hurt by the words none the less.</p>

<HR>

<p>"…Now tell me again how you cast the
spell." They were going over the ritual,
trying to find out why it had been so far reaching.</p>

<p>"Well, I lit the incense and called on the God and
Goddess and then I invoked the four corners, then . . ."</p>

<p>"You called both the God and the Goddess?"</p>

<p>"Yes" Willow answered in a small whisper.</p>

<p>"That’s it then. Willow, when you do a
truth spell, it is customary to call on the Goddess of
truth, when you invoke the God too, then . . ."</p>

<p>"The spell is twice as potent!"</p>

<p>"Obvious statement number two . . .way to go
Will." Buffy was leaning on the counter
behind them.</p>

<p>"Buffy, that wasn’t very nice. How could
you say that to her?" Xander spoke up now and
crossed the room towards her.</p>

<p>"It’s the truth, Xand. If you don’t mind,
why don’t you try to be annoying on your own behalf next
time." Buffy retorted.</p>

<p>"Xander, it’s the spell, not
Buffy." Willow leapt to her defense.</p>

<p>"Will, how can you defend her, she’s being so mean to
you?"</p>

<p>"But, it’s the truth, Xander. . .she’s telling the
truth about how she feels."</p>

<p>Buffy’s gaze went to both of them. "I’m
sorry, guys. I just can’t seem to help
myself. Any thing that crosses my mind comes out of my
mouth." She began to study the floor.</p>

<p>"Yes, well. It occurs to me that this is
not only a truth spell. You have managed to
phrase your spell in such a way that those effected will
speak their mind as well."</p>

<p>Willow gave him a confused look. "You mean
‘each word that’s thought is spoken new’?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes indeed."</p>

<p>"So what Buffy and everyone else in the dorm is
saying, isn’t necessarily the truth. Just the
first thought that crosses their mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, you’re right Xander." Giles smiled</p>

<p>"I’m right? I mean, yeah, I’m
right!" His smile broadened.</p>

<p>"Although the spell was powerful, I believe it only
effected your floor. As you wanted, Willow,
it will only last twenty four hours. I’d
suggest just waiting it out."</p>

<p>They couldn’t tell, but it looked like Giles had an
amused look on his face.</p>

<p>"You think this is funny, don’t you tweed
guy? Why am I affected? Why isn’t
Willow spurting out truths and what ever is on HER
mind?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn’t present, but one would assume that
you, Buffy, were outside the circle of
protection. If even a piece of fabric was
outside of it, then you would feel the effects of the
spell."</p>

<p>"I was in the circle!"</p>

<p>"But you were on the edge of it, Buffy.
You were trying to avoid the incense,
remember?" Willow reminded her.</p>

<p>"Just great! Everyone on our floor,
including me, has a need to share their fuzzy feelings
for the next twenty four hours . . .except, of course,
for the little witch!" Again, Buffy looked over to
Willow. "Will, I . . ."</p>

<p>"I know, you’re sorry." She made a little
grimace.</p>

<p>"Might I suggest that you avoid the dormitory
tonight? Why not stay somewhere else until
the effects of the spell wear off?"</p>

<p>"My parents aren’t home . . .we could stay
there?" She posed the question to Buffy,
hoping for somewhat of a level-headed response.</p>

<p>"Sure, Will. I’d never pass up the chance
to sleep with you." Her eyes went wide with
surprise. "I mean, uh. . ."</p>

<p>Giles cleared his throat. "Ahem, yes,
well, come see me tomorrow, preferably after it’s worn
off."</p>

<HR>

<p>They walked to the dorms to get their
stuff. Both prepared overnight bags and
Willow grabbed her laptop. They headed off to
Willow’s house in silence. Willow, afraid to
provoke any more truths, and Buffy, afraid to hurt her
friends’ feelings anymore than she already
had. They walked in and headed up to Willow’s
room.</p>

<p>"I’m really sorry about this, Buffy." She
was standing over at the balcony. "I didn’t
think it was going to be like this."</p>

<p>"No, I guess you didn’t think, Will, but there’s
nothing we can do about it now. I’m starved,
we never did get to eat."</p>

<p>Willow let out a heavy sigh. "We can order
pizza if you want? Do you think you could do
me a favor? I mean, I probably shouldn’t ask,
and I know you’re probably not going to be able to do
it, and I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t. . ."</p>

<p>"Would you stop babbling and just ask
already?" Again, her hand came to her mouth
and she looked over to her friend. "This
speaking your mind thing really sucks,
Will." She walked up behind
her. "I’m sorry. You know I’m
sorry right? I mean, it’s not like I mean to
say it. I guess I just never realized the
things that passed through my mind until I was forced to
say them. I’d never hurt you intentionally."</p>

<p>"I know, Buffy. Do you think you could try
to . . .curb yourself. I know you don’t mean
it, but it doesn’t make it hurt any
less." She hugged herself.</p>

<p>"I can try. I’m not going to make any
promises though."</p>

<p>Soon the pizza arrived and Willow ran downstairs to
get it. She headed upstairs again and noticed
that Buffy had accessorized while she was gone.</p>

<p>"Buffy, what’s that?" Her eyebrows arched
at the sight.</p>

<p>Around her neck, Buffy had a piece of string and
hanging from it on a piece of cardboard were printed the
words ‘I’m sorry’.</p>

<p>"I know you’re probably sick of hearing it, so I
figured if I wore my heart on my sleeve, so to speak,
then, well . . ." She gave the redhead a
sheepish grin.</p>

<p>Willow put the pizza down and walked over to her
friend to give her a hug. "Aww, Buffy, that’s
so sweet! I know you don’t mean to say those
things."</p>

<p>Buffy inhaled as her friend enveloped her in a
hug. "Wow, you smell so good,
Will. Tasty even." She pulled back
and was met with the same shocked expression she was
probably giving off. "I, uh . . ."</p>

<p>Willow pointed to the sign and Buffy nodded silently.
</p>

<p>They ate quickly enough and decided that showers and
pajama’s were in order for the night’s movie
fest. Willow’s parents always had a good
supply of movies in the den and there were a few that
they wouldn’t mind seeing again.</p>

<p>Willow gathered her stuff and set off to the
bathroom. "I shouldn’t be
long." She gave her friend a smile and was
out the door.</p>

<p>As soon as she heard the shower turn on, Buffy ran
over to the computer and booted it up. &lt;Come on, come
on . . . why are these damn things always so
slow? I have to find out who she was talking
about. . . .where is it? Start, documents . .
.ah ha! Here it is!&gt; Inpatients got the best of her
and instead of reading, she started skimming
again. She got half way down the page and
heard the shower turn off. Quickly, she
closed the document and started a game of solitaire.</p>

<p>"Hey, I’m done if you want the shower
now." She gave her a questioning
look. "Buffy, what’s your sudden fascination
with my computer? I thought you hated it?"</p>

<p>Buffy turned around and looked over to her
friend. Wet. In a
robe. With water droplets still across her
chest.</p>

<p>"Uh, nice robe, Will. . . kinda techni-color, isn’t
it?" She smiled but it faded quickly when she
saw the look of shock on her face.</p>

<p>"What? Techni . . . Buffy, what have you
been doing at my computer?" She crossed the
room, but Buffy closed the lid before she got
there. "Buffy?"</p>

<p>"I thought we didn’t keep secrets from each other,
Will? Why didn’t you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Why didn’t I tell you? You’re kidding,
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we tell each other everything,
Will. If your having feelings for . . ."</p>

<p>"Don’t say it! I can’t talk about this
with you. . . I can’t believe you were snooping in my
computer!" She ran out of the room and locked
herself in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Buffy was right on her heels. "Will, I’m
sorry." She took her little sign off and
pushed it under the door to prove her
point. She heard a noise, then saw the sign
again . . .only this time it was ripped in two.</p>

<p>Buffy was sitting outside the door pleading with her
for the past ten minutes. She still wouldn’t
budge.</p>

<p>"Come on, Will. Nobody like a
non-budger." As the minutes passed, Buffy
became more and more frightened that she’d REALLY don’t
it this time. "Will? Are you still
in there?" She leaned her head against the
door. "It doesn’t matter to me who you like,
Will, I mean if Tara makes you happy, then . . ."</p>

<p>She didn’t get a chance to finish her sentence
because her face met the floor when the door swung open.</p>

<p>"Tara? You think it’s. . .How much of it
did you read?" Willow was looking down at the
pile of Buffy on the floor.</p>

<p>"I, uh . . . I only skimmed it. I didn’t
read it word for word." She smiled up at her.
</p>

<p>Willow tried to walk out of the bathroom but Buffy
scrambled to her feet and closed the
door. "Buffy, let me out of
here. You’re being childish." She
averted her gaze.</p>

<p>"Childish? Who locked themselves in here
for almost a half hour?" What Willow said
finally dawned on her. "If it’s not Tara,
then who is it Will?"</p>

<p>"I can’t do this." She tried to push her
way past the slayer, but Buffy grabbed her arm and the
robe came undone.</p>

<p>"Holyohmygodyourbeautiful!" Buffy’s eyes
danced across the exposed flesh she’d created.</p>

<p>Willow quickly covered herself up and blushed several
shades of red. "Cut it out, Buffy."</p>

<p>She reached out and touched her arm. "I
mean it, Will. You’ve got a great body, just
as good as Faith’s, only paler."</p>

<p>They looked at each other and it was Buffy’s turn to
change colors.</p>

<p>"Faith?" Willow shook her
head. "No, you wouldn’t have. . .I mean. .
.Faith?"</p>

<p>Buffy gave her shoulders a little
shrug. "I didn’t have sex with her or
anything. We just . . .fooled around a
little."</p>

<p>Willow couldn’t believe what she was
hearing "You fooled around with Faith?"</p>

<p>"I can’t lie to you, Will. You made sure
of that." Buffy had this overwhelming urge to
touch her. Maybe it was the spell, or the
flash of flesh. She reached out and put her
hands on her shoulders. "You don’t think any
less of me . . .do you?"</p>

<p>Willow turned around and suddenly, forming words
wasn’t her top priority, breathing was. She took a deep
breath and tried to respond. "Buffy, I, no, I
wouldn’t think less of you." She gave a little half
smile.</p>

<p>Buffy reached up and touched her
face. "You know, when you smile your mouth
curls up in the cutest way."</p>

<p>Willow backed up a little away from her
touch. "Stop, Buffy. You don’t
mean to say it. It’s the spell making you do it."</p>

<p>"The spell may be making me say it, but that doesn’t
mean it isn’t the truth." Buffy leaned in and
kissed her cheek lightly.</p>

<p>"I can’t believe this is finally
happening." Willow’s hand pushed her away,
realizing what she’d just said.</p>

<p>"Finally?" Buffy looked at her, then it
clicked. "You weren’t talking about Tara . .
.you were talking about me!" Willow’s silence
was all the answer she needed. "Is that what
this spell was for? Why couldn’t you have
just asked me?"</p>

<p>"Buffy I, you don’t, I mean we can’t, I wasn’t going
to, you don’t have to. . ."</p>

<p>The babblefest was cut short with Buffy leaning in
and kissing her lightly. Both surprised by
the action they froze in place, unsure of
themselves. Buffy pulled back and looked into
her eyes for any hint of remorse. When she
found none, she leaned in again, this time more sure of
herself. It was a kiss designed to ease both
their fears, soft and slow. Quickly it built
into passion with a hint of promise. Willow
broke away first.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I . . .wow."</p>

<p>"I think that sums it up." She put her
forehead against the redhead’s. Slowly her
hands came up and began to untie the robe.</p>

<p>"Buffy, don’t you think we should
talk?" Willow began to get nervous.</p>

<p>She lifted her head up so they were eye to
eye. "Nope . . .no more talking, need more
touching." She reached up and in one fell
swoop the robe was gone. Buffy reached down
for her friends hands and brought them up to her
face. Sweetly, she kissed both her
palms. "My turn." She started to
remove her shirt, then Willow got the hint and took
over.</p>

<p>With all of their clothes cast aside, Buffy led her
into the shower and turned the water
on. Standing behind her, she reached around
the redhead’s waist and began to lather her up with a
washcloth.</p>

<p>Willow couldn’t believe this was
happening. She was in the shower with
Buffy. Buffy was in the shower with
her! She was washing her, with soap, and
kissing her neck and reaching down to wash . . ."Oh,
Buffy."</p>

<p>"Hmm?"</p>

<p>Her voice was barely a whisper. "But I
already took a shower."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled and turned her
around. "Always the practical one, huh
Will? And who says you can’t take two showers
in one day? Hmm?"</p>

<p>Willow stopped her ministrations. "We
should be talking, not touching." She looked
up at her, hoping she’d agree. She wasn’t
sure how much longer she could hold out being this naked
with her.</p>

<p>"Okay, yeah . . .you’re right Will. It is
the spell making me say these things. I
couldn’t even lie to you now if I tried. . .but all that
does is prove how bad I want to be with you. . ." *kiss*
"and touch you . . ." *kiss* "and possibly even make
love to you. . ." *kiss* "I’ve never had the nerve to
say it . . ." *kiss* "but thanks to your little
spell-gone-awry, I do now."</p>

<p>The water was hitting her back and head, running down
her face. Luckily, it hid the tears that
welled up in her eyes as Buffy said everything she’d
ever wanted to hear and more.</p>

<p>"Hey, I see that glimmer in your eye . . . no crying,
this is supposed to be a happy time." She
reached up to brush the water from her face but it was
useless. Suddenly, she broke into
song. "Come on get haaaappppyyyyy!"</p>

<p>Willow chuckled. "I don’t think the
Partridge family would appreciate your slaying of their
song, Buffy." Buffy gave a little
pout. "Not saying it wasn’t a good effort,
though. Nice try. . .high marks!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, Will." Buffy whispered.</p>

<p>Willow knew what she meant. She knew Buffy
wanted to know how she felt about her. "How
about if I let you read my little essay?"</p>

<p>"That’s chickening out and you know
it." Buffy glanced up at her from under her
eyelashes.</p>

<p>"Don’t give me those slayer-eyes,
Buffy. You know I can’t resist
them." Willow pouted a
little. "Later? I
promise." She gave a little shiver.</p>

<p>"You cold? Here, let me turn up the heat
for you." Buffy reached over and pulled her
closer. Their lips met and passion
ensued. Everything and anything they knew in
the world was wrapped up in each other at this
moment. Finally, Buffy broke the
kiss "Come on, I think we’ve had enough
shower time to last us a week at least."</p>

<p>They got out and dried each other
off. Without saying a word, Buffy led her to
the bedroom, neither one of them bothering with
clothing.</p>

<p>They stood in the middle of the room about a foot
away from each other. Taking perhaps a moment
or two to drink in the sight of each other.
Boldly, Willow stepped up to her and smoothed back the
wet hair from the slayer’s shoulders. She
lightly placed a kiss on her shoulder, then her neck,
then her earlobe . . .finally laying a kiss lightly on
her cheek before pulling away. "You’re
beautiful. I always thought you were . . .now
I know for sure."</p>

<p>Neither of them wanting to break away, they sunk down
on the floor in unison. Kneeling in front of
each other, Buffy began again the assault on her lips
she’d started in the bathroom. It was too
much for either one of them to handle and they wound up
laying down on the floor.</p>

<p>"ur ugs itchy" Buffy offered through a
kiss.</p>

<p>Willow pulled away and smiled. "One more
time without my lips."</p>

<p>"I said your rug is itchy." She reached
over and grabbed the comforter off the bed. After some
rearrangement, they had spread the blanket out and were
laying next to each other.</p>

<p>"This is nice."</p>

<p>"Actually, it’s like a dream." Willow
reached her hand up to cup her mouth.</p>

<p>"You’ve dreamed about me Will?" Buffy
rolled over and propped herself up on her side.</p>

<p>"Well . . ." Without warning, Willow
pushed her down to the floor and was hovering over
her. "Maybe."</p>

<p>"Hmm, brute force. I didn’t think you had
it in you." Buffy smiled but noticed that
Willow’s expression had softened. "What is it
Will?"</p>

<p>"Did Faith have it in her? I mean, did you
two . . ." She scrunched up her mouth in
frustration.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn’t like that. It was . . .
interesting. She made what was like the
hundredth pass at me and that time I didn’t back down
and she followed through." Buffy exhaled a
bit. "We’d just dusted some vamps and she was
talking about it making her hungry and
horny. She said she needed a release and
could think of a few places she’d like to
start. I said so why don’t you
start, and she did." Buffy
chuckled a bit. "We actually wound up in the
crypt where the glove of Myddigon was found a few days
later. I stopped before it got too
far. I felt guilty because all I could think
about was. . ."</p>

<p>"Angel." Willow cut in.</p>

<p>Buffy reached up and touched her face
lightly. "No miss-know-it-all, I felt guilty
because all I could think about was how I wished it was
you. I wasn’t being fair to her."</p>

<p>Willow gave her a confused look. "But,
that was the beginning of last year,
Buffy." Then it dawned on
her. "You mean you’ve . . .since last year
and didn’t . . .I don’t believe it."</p>

<p>"Yes, last year. Honestly, since you let
me dress you up for Halloween. I gotta say,
you looked quite delectable in my
clothing." She gave a naughty little smile.</p>

<p>Willow bent down and kissed her. She
decided that Buffy was right before – enough talking,
not enough touching. Willow kissed her way
down the slayer’s stomach, stopping only to marvel at
the tightness and smoothness of it. She was
determined to show her how she felt even if she couldn’t
put it into words at the moment.</p>

<p>Buffy wriggled under her
ministrations. She couldn’t believe that this
was really happening, couldn’t believe that it was all
coming true. She inhaled a little at the
feathery touch of the redhead’s hair on her stomach then
all thought became impossible.
"Ungohgodwillowgodunhooh!" Before reaching
the final destination on the road they’d set out on,
Buffy reached down and pulled her up. She
began to cry softly into her red hair.</p>

<p>"Buffy . . .what’s wrong? Did I do
something wrong?" Willow smoothed the hair
away from her face and wiped away the tears.</p>

<p>"No, you didn’t do anything. I just . . I can’t . .
.It’s too intense. . .I can’t, I mean I’ve never. . ."</p>

<p>"Not even with Angel?"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head no.</p>

<p>"Not even with yourself?" She blushed a
little at the boldness of the statement, but considering
where she’d just been, it wasn’t really a time to get
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"No. I’m so afraid to let go,
Will. I’m just so afraid to lose
control." She was a little calmer now.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I’m sorry, I didn’t know." She’d
dropped her voice to a soothing whisper.</p>

<p>"No, you didn’t . . no one did. So now you
know my little secret thanks to this damn spell of
yours." She turned away.</p>

<p>Willow wasn’t sure what to do. Here, not
six inches away, was her naked best friend. This was a
scenario she’d dreamed of for as long as they’d known
each other, but it wasn’t turning out exactly the way
she’d expected. Slowly, she reached over and
rubbed Buffy’s arm. She made her way down to
her hand and put it in her own.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Will?"</p>

<p>"Shh, just follow my lead." Every place
she touched, she made Buffy touch too. After
a few minutes, she became bolder and heard her let out a
little sigh. "Feel good?"</p>

<p>"Umm humm." She stopped her and rolled
over to face her. "I love you, Will,
really. But I don’t think I can . . ."</p>

<p>"If you can’t, you can’t. That not
important, Buffy. What’s important is that
you know how much I care about you, how much I love
you." She reached up and cupped her face with
one hand. "How I just want to make you
happy."</p>

<p>The tears slipped down her face for the last
time. She hooked the back of her head with
her hand and pulled Willow in for a
kiss. This time, it was a kiss designed to
conquer, to overcome. Overcome her own fears
and frustrations. It became more passionate,
more intense and suddenly Buffy couldn’t figure out
where her body ended and Willow’s began. Their actions
from the past hour culminated in a rush of moans and
tears. Buffy was finally able to let go of
all the worry and trepidation she’d held inside for as
long as she could remember.</p>

<p>"Hey, weren’t you the one who told me no
crying?" Willow leaned over and kissed the
tear away from her cheek. "Are you
okay? I mean you’re not hurt or anything?"</p>

<p>Buffy smiled in the darkness. "No, Will, I
don’t think you have the right equipment for
that. I’m fine, really. It’s just
such a release. I didn’t think it could be
that good."</p>

<p>Willow’s smile broadened. "Wow. .
.thanks!"</p>

<p>"Hmm, thank you. I didn’t think I could
ever. . . when I couldn’t with Angel, he understood, but
. . ." She shook her head. "Never mind, I
just love you." She leaned over for a quick
kiss.</p>

<p>"I think we should get some sleep, don’t
you? I mean after all, it has been a very,
umm, stressful night."</p>

<p>Buffy agreed and they got up together and crawled
into bed. Buffy was smoothing the hair away
from Willow’s face and noticed that her eye’s were
filling up. "What is it, Will?"</p>

<p>"I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you before. I
just . . .it scares me and I was afraid that if you
didn’t feel that way, then you’d run away from me and
things between us would never be the same. I
couldn’t risk that, so I thought that a truth spell was
the best way out." She sniffled and looked over at
her. "I really am sorry,
Buffy. I’ll never do it again."</p>

<p>"Don’t give it another thought, Will. If
you hadn’t done the spell, then I never would have
admitted that I felt that way too. I’ve had
all these feelings inside of me for so long, and I
wanted to say them out loud . . but I was scared that
you’d run too."</p>

<p>They laid there in compatible silence for a while,
then Willow spoke up. "Buffy, can you promise
me one thing?"</p>

<p>"Sure, anything."</p>

<p>"Lets not go to see Giles until AFTER the spell has
worn off."</p>

<p>"Buffy chuckled a bit. "I wouldn’t have it
any other way." She snuggled in
closer. "I love you."</p>

<p>"I love you too, Buffy. That’s the truth
and nothing but."</p>
