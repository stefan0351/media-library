<!-- Moment by Moment \ 3. Realization -->

<p>And that, is the day that my life fell apart.</p>
<p>I lost Sam. That's the most important thing. She can't
tolerate my presence.</p>
<p>But along with that, my popularity has suffered because
Nicole has warred a smear campaign against me, using my somewhat
ambiguous sexuality status against me. And honestly, I wouldn't give
a rat's ass about all that, if she wasn't still using Sam as a weapon.</p>
<p>You see, since my defense of Sam that day, rumors have
started (begun, no doubt by none other than Ms Julian) that there was
something going on between Sam and I. Nicole has spread this tale
that she found out about it and THAT'S why she did what she did to
Sam. Now Sam and I are looking like the bad guys, the adulterer and
the seductress, as it were, and Nicole is somehow ending up looking
like the wronged victim. Doesn't help that I got a 3-day suspension
and a stint in therapy for my `violent outburst'. Fuck `violent
outburst'; bitch is lucky I didn't have a sharp object. Let me SHOW
you `violent outburst'.</p>
<p>Did I take those stupid meds this morning?</p>
<p>Sam's friends have been no help. Remind me NOT to call them
in a crisis. Lily's off crusading to save whatever pathetic little
forest animal she thinks needs saving this week while Josh, driftwood
Josh, follows her around like a demented puppy. (Did he follow ME
like that? Scary) Carmen is busy obsessing about?something. Whether
it's about if people think SHE'S gay, or her weight, cheerleading, or
her mother or whatnot, she hasn't been there for Sam. And Harrison?
What an ass. He gives new meaning to the words `idiot homophobe'.
With Sam and Nicole `out', he was getting antsy, given that he was
still having issues about his mother being a lesbian. Now that
questions are floating around about MY sexuality, he's carrying
around Lysol and plastic gloves, apparently afraid of `gay germs' or
something as equally insane and impossible. </p>
<p>Sometimes I think that boy is a few french fries short of a
Happy Meal.</p>
<p>A few tacos short of a combo plate?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm wandering.</p>
<p>Anyway, naturally, the parentals found out about EVERYTHING.
And yes, somehow it still managed to be MY fault because I should
have `kept a better reign' on Nicole. You know, I feel guilty enough
over what happened but does the girl LOOK like a Clydesdale to you?
I don't need any more guilt. I have enough of my own.</p>
<p>But I've gotten off track, this is about Sam.</p>
<p>Her hand needed stitches and stubborn ass that she is, she
refused to go see a doctor for so long that it got infected. She was
kind of sick for a bit and COULDN'T go to school. Now she WON'T go.</p>
<p>She's a hermit now. Barely speaks to anyone, let alone me. She
dropped out of the school newspaper, left the track team, and never
hangs out with her friends. It's like she lost faith in EVERYONE
because of this. She doesn't even play with little Mackenzie and
that's just sad because Mac's just a baby. She has no malicious
intent towards Sam. Hell, the words `malicious intent' only sound
like gobbalty gook to the tyke. She only knows that Sam's her sister
and that she loves her and wants to play with her. But Sam hardly
leaves her room. It's a fight to get her to leave her room every
morning to go to school. She barely eats and when she does, it's not
at dinner with us. I should say, `not at dinner with me' because I'm
the one she's obviously avoiding.</p>
<p>She's gotten rail thin and she was small to start with. Of
anyone, I think I should know what's dangerous when it comes to
weight and she's starting to wander into that area. Her face is too
thin; her cheekbones jut out at odd angles; there are deep wells of
dark purple and grey under her eyes. Her hair, that I usually would
have called luxurious and gleaming is dull and kind of ratty
looking. In a word, she looks like shit.</p>
<p>Every time I approach her, to apologize, to talk or whatever,
the outburst I get from her gets increasingly loud and nearly
violent. Nicole really did a number on her and I don't know how to
reach her. </p>
<p>And yet, despite my repeated failures?I can't stop trying.</p>
