<p><b>A/N: Another random idea, and again, badly written :P<br>
So yeah. Hope you at least enjoy it a tiny bit, and please review :)</b></p>
<p>"Got it...yeah...okay...that should be easy enough."</p>
<p>Miley waded over to her blonde friend, who she had thought had been acting strange all morning. "What should be easy enough?" she asked, placing herself next to her on the sofa.</p>
<p>Lilly glanced at her for a minute, "Will do, bye," she said quickly, flipping her phone back over.</p>
<p>"Just Oliver, talking about...the...science project," she tried. She never was good under pressure, as anyone who knew her knew all too well.</p>
<p>Miley raised an eyebrow, "I'd keep buggin' ya about it but I'm already bored enough," she sighed, turning her attention to the TV screen. She sighed again, this time louder and with a groan thrown in, "<i>Lilly</i>," she whined, "You promised no skateboarding!"</p>
<p>Lilly chuckled, "Good job it's surfboarding then, huh?"</p>
<p>Miley threw her a glance, "I was half way there." She smiled as Lilly turned back to the screen, she didn't actually mind what was on the television, as long as it would make her best friend happy and a bright smile appear on her face.</p>
<p>"Whatcha' wonna' do?" Miley asked, turning away from the blonde, not to stare for too long.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled on the inside, but tried to answer as innocently and natural as possible, "We could go to that new sushi place."</p>
<p>"The one that's just opened?"</p>
<p>"That's generally what new is," Lilly laughed, receiving daggers from Miley, "And yeah, there," she finished, willing for the stares to stop.</p>
<p>"How exactly would we get in there. It's all exclusive and posh," Miley continued listing words to describe the new swanky restaurant that had opened, but a smile appeared on her face as she noticed Lilly giving her a don't-be-so-dumb look, "and I should really have thought of that by now, huh?" she smiled.</p>
<p>Lilly just laughed, "Shall we, Hannah?"</p>
<p>"We shall, Lola," Miley laughed as she got to her feet, her actions soon being mirrored by Lilly.</p>
<p>They headed for the stairs, and proceeded to pick out each others outfits. Miley had quickly chosen hers, not in the mood to stand around and wait, but Lilly had been extra picky about her outfit today, something which she never normally was.</p>
<p>Miley was sitting on her bed, impatiently, reading a magazine.</p>
<p>"Does this look okay...or would it go more with the pink wig. I think it wou-"</p>
<p>"It's fine. Let's go," Miley said simply in an unimpressed, deadpan tone.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't have time to argue as Miley grabbed her hand and dragged her away towards the stairs.</p>
<p>"Table for two?" she asked politely to the man who stood at the front, smartly dressed in a tux. He lifted to menus, "Of course. Follow me Miss Montana and Miss..."</p>
<p>"Don't ask," Miley said quickly, seeing Lilly's eyebrows raise and her mouth open.</p>
<p>Lilly shot her a look, which she smiled at.</p>
<p>The man shook away the behaviour of the two teens infront of him, and headed for their table. No teenagers could get in this place, no teenagers that is, except Hannah Montana and her guests.</p>
<p>"Thankyou," she smiled politely as she took her seat.</p>
<p>The man handed them their menus, stating that their waiter would be around soon to take their orders for drinks and food.</p>
<p>"This place is nice," Miley noted, glancing around at the modern d√©cor that covered the interior of the building.</p>
<p>Lilly just nodded with a 'hmm'. She didn't seem to be paying attention to Miley or her menu, but was looking around the place expectantly.</p>
<p>"Who you lookin' for?" Miley asked, looking in the same direction as her wigged friend.</p>
<p>Lilly quickly shot her head back to Miley, "No one. Nothing. I'm hungry, <i>should we eat? </i>I think we should eat."</p>
<p>Miley just shook it off again. If you're friends with Lilly for long enough, you'd realise that this kind of behaviour comes with the package.</p>
<p>"Everybody down! Everybody get down!"</p>
<p>Miley darted her head around to see two tall, masked men walking through the doors, guns pointed in all directions and shouting orders.</p>
<p>She couldn't help the scream that escaped her mouth, and instead of stand and worry like everyone else did, she sank into her seat, hoping to look like part of the furniture.</p>
<p>Lilly looked over to her, worry plastered on her face. "What do we do?" she whispered through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Miley nodded to the side, and began sliding from her chair.</p>
<p>She placed herself on the floor next to the table, quickly being joined by Lilly.</p>
<p>"Where's the pop star?" One of the men shouted, looking around and still swinging his gun manically.</p>
<p>Miley gulped hard, "Please tell me there's another pop star in here," she whispered, more to herself than anyone else.</p>
<p>Lilly peered over the table, "They have guns."</p>
<p>"Thanks Einstein," Miley shot back in a loud, angry whisper.</p>
<p>Lilly continued watching the men, making sure she couldn't be seen over the table.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna' die, I'm gonna' die, I'm gonna' die."</p>
<p>She returned her vision back to her best friend, who now seemed near panic attack. She took her face in her hands, "Hannah. Focus. We'll be fine if you stay calm."</p>
<p>"There's two men, with guns, shouting for me. Sorry if I'm not feelin' to cool right now!"</p>
<p>Lilly shushed her, hearing the last part of her statement escape her lips in more than a whisper.</p>
<p>"Lilly, if I'm gonna' die I don't wonna' die with regrets."</p>
<p>"Will you stop being so dramatic?" She peered back over the table, the men were moving around now, looking around the tables and chairs for their target.</p>
<p>"I'm not being dramatic, Lola. I need to tell you before I die."</p>
<p>Lilly felt instantly guilty, this kind of fear wasn't good for anyone, "Tell me what?" she asked, not looking back to Miley but still watching the criminals.</p>
<p>Miley grabbed her arms, turning her to face her, and instantly slammed their lips together.</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes remained open, even wider than before.</p>
<p>Miley pulled back moments later, "I<i> like like</i> you," she took a breath, "Okay, now I can die," she proclaimed, closing her eyes slightly.</p>
<p>"Hannah...it's-"</p>
<p>"Hannah Montana."</p>
<p>Lilly looked up, as did Miley, and saw one of the men stood beside them.</p>
<p>He pointed the gun directly at her, causing her to scream slightly.</p>
<p>"Why are you doing this?" she cried.</p>
<p>"Can't we jus-"</p>
<p>"Shut up!" he shouted, moving the gun momentarily over to Lilly.</p>
<p>Miley whimpered a little, looking over to to her now blue haired friend.</p>
<p>Why did she not look scared?</p>
<p>"Hannah, it's no-"</p>
<p>"Hannah Montana you just got <i>punk'd!</i>" laughed a very familiar, brown haired guy as he walked over to the two of them as they sat on the floor.</p>
<p>"Real," Lilly finished, still looking a little shocked about what had transpired moments ago.</p>
<p>Miley's eyes widened, before tightly closing for a moment.</p>
<p>She wasn't in the mood to play for the camera's, not when she had just confessed her true feelings for her best friend infront of them.</p>
<p>"You set this all up?"</p>
<p>Lilly just simply nodded.</p>
<p>"And you didn't think to tell me?"</p>
<p>"That would kinda' defeat the object," Lilly tried, quickly being silenced by a response.</p>
<p>"Lilly, I can't believe you made me do that!"</p>
<p>"Well I didn't know you were gonna kiss me!" Lilly shouted in defence.</p>
<p>The whole place had fell quiet when the crew had shown themselves, and now the confrontation between the two could be heard throughout and seen from the onlooking camera's.</p>
<p>"I wish I hadn't now," Miley mumbled.</p>
<p>"Really?" Lilly asked, strongly and a little sarcastically.</p>
<p>Miley looked up at her, "Yes."</p>
<p>Lilly looked at her for a moment, trying to read her expression. "I don't."</p>
<p>She moved forward, capturing Miley's lips just before she could produce a comeback.</p>
<p>The kiss was brief. Only a few smooth, soft touches of the lips being received and given from each girl, their mouths slightly open.</p>
<p>Lilly slowly moved back, to be greeted by a huge, heartfelt smile from the girl that sat opposite her.</p>
<p>"I don't."</p>
