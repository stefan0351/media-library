<!-- Behind the Scenes \ Part 1 -->

<p>Robert Jackson stood up and began to pace, taking a moment to glance at his watch. </p>

		<p>"Damn it, where are they?" he muttered, glaring at the door.</p>

		<p>"I'm sure they'll be here soon, Rob" Sarah offered calmly, fighting the overwhelming urge to join him.</p>

		<p>It was ten past one, and the four occupants of the room were getting restless. Several days ago, Robert had recieved a call from Gen X-TV, telling him that an executive would come by to talk about the show. Unsurprisingly, they offered no other information and Rob couldn't help wonder whether his pride and joy was on the cutting block, despite it's popularity and good ratings.</p>

		<p>The television business was so brutal these days.</p>

		<p>He stopped his pacing as a loud knock echoed through out the room. Taking a deep breath, he walked over and prepared to greet the mysterious visitor.</p>

		<p>"Good afternoon", he welcomed, offering his hand to the short and overweight man. "I'm Robert Jackson, Creator and Producer of Kennedy High. Please come on in".</p>

		<p>"I can't stay long" the man brushed by, ignoring the polite greeting. "I'm a busy man, so let's get to it shall we?" He sat in the nearest chair and gestured impatiently to Robert to take a seat.</p>

		<p>Robert glared at the man as he made himself comfortable at the other end. </p>

		<p>"Who are you?" he asked, a little angrily. He really wanted to throw the little fat man out the window but restrained himself, pretty sure that the station wouldn't appreciate one of their own dying on the job.</p>

		<p>The man shrugged. "Doesn't matter, does it? What's important is why I'm here."</p>

		<p>"Then why are are you here?" Co-producer Jack Greer asked, leaning forward. "You're not going to shut us down are you?"</p>

		<p>The man shook his head. "No. Your show is doing okay but we believe it can do better."</p>

		<p>"Is that so?" Writer Helen Morris asked sarcastically. She couldn't stand it when the higher ups barged in and tried to take over. She would have bet her entire bank account that he had never see an episode of  Kennedy High in his life.</p>

		<p>"Yes, that is so" the man replied, ignoring her tone. "We have discussed some possible ideas that we would like to see implemented on the show."</p>

		<p>"And if we don't agree with them?" Sarah asked.</p>

		<p>"It is not a suggestion. We are not asking for your opinion. Either you work them in, or we'll find new writers. It's up to you". The man answered casually, not caring either way. </p>

		<p>Robert clenched and unclenched his fists underneath the table, trying to keep calm. </p>

		<p>"What ideas?", he managed to asked.</p>

		<p>"Lesbians" was the response.</p>

		<p>They all stared at him. He continued.</p>

		<p>"We want lesbians on the show. Everybody is doing it, and more often than not, the ratings fly." He leaned forward and paused dramatically. "We want lesbians."</p>

		<p>It was Sarah who was the first to recover. </p>

		<p>"Okay, um, we do have a large gay/lesbian fan base for the show and actually, we have been discussing whether we should have the character Belinda Lawson outted. We had implied that Belinda and Gabby had shared a kiss in..."</p>

		<p>"No", The man interrupted, looking at his notes. "Not her".</p>

		<p>"Why not?" Jack asked with a frown.</p>

		<p>"We had others in mind".</p>

		<p>"Others? You want more than one main gay character?" Helen asked intrigued. "Like who?"</p>

		<p>"Alexandra Altman and Jeri Anderson", he replied after taking a moment to read his notes. </p>

		<p>For the second time in minutes, the man left them all speechless.</p>

		<p>"Do you even watch the show?" Robert finally asked, shaking his head.</p>

		<p>"No." was the bored response.</p>

		<p>"Figures!" Robert answered, his voice rising. "If you did, than you would know that Jeri and Alex are step sisters! You want them in a relationship?!"</p>

		<p>After taking a minute to re-read his notes, the short man looked up. "Yes". </p>

		<p>"You're serious?" Jack asked, increduously. </p>

		<p>The man barely glanced at him before picking up a sheet of paper then reading off it.</p>

		<p>"Fact: Samantha McPherson and Brooke McQueen are two of the most popular actresses amongst young adults today. Another fact: Alexandra Altman and Jeri Anderson are the most popular characters on the show and the main reasons why the viewers tune in."</p>

		<p>He put the sheet down, frustrated. He didn't have time for this crap.</p>

		<p>"Another fact. Gen X-TV want higher ratings and this is how they want you to do it. Almost every fucking show on television has some girl on girl action and the viewers are watching them in droves. You want to keep your jobs? You have those two girls go at it like rabbits."</p>

		<p>He stood up and put his notes in his briefcase. He walked over to the door, throwing one last comment before he walked out. "This isn't a request. It's a statement of fact".</p>

		<p>Shocked silence descended on the room.</p>

		<p>"I can't believe this", Robert said, after several long moments. </p>

		<p>"He has a point, you know" Helen offered quietly. </p>

		<p>"What?!" Jack cried out, standing up. "You agree with that ass?"</p>

		<p>"Alex and Jeri ARE the most popular characters from the show and the chemistry between Sam and Brooke is quite amazing to watch. The viewers love them, and if we do this right, a potential romantic storyline between them could really work", she explained with a shrug.</p>

		<p>"I don't think they want romance", Sarah pointed out in disgust. "The way he was speaking, they wouldn't mind just having them screw for the whole episode."</p>

		<p>"I don't think many fans would say no to that", Helen responded with a smirk. They all laughed, the tension in the room easing considerably. Robert crossed his arms as he leaned back, putting his feet on the table. </p>

		<p>"Alex and Jeri, huh?" He focused his attention back on the others. "Maybe it isn't such a bad idea after all". </p>

		<p>"Are we really going through with this? I mean, for crying out loud, they're fucking step sisters!" Jack exclaimed, staring at Robert in amazement. </p>

		<p>"Why should a little thing like that stop them?" Sarah replied rheotircally. "Every great romance has obstacles before the characters find never ending bliss and the stepsister thing is classic! If the viewers don't tune in to see that, I don't know what will. Besides, you heard the guy. Do you want to lose your job?"</p>

		<p>"No!" He answered, then looked up with a sheepish smile. "I liked the idea of Jeri and Carter."</p>

		<p>Helen laughed, hitting him with a bunched up piece of paper. "You sound like a fifteen year old girl".</p>

		<p>He threw it back at her and grinned. "Fuck you".</p>

		<p>Robert clapped his hands, trying to gather their attention. "That's quite enough children". He leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table as he gazed at his head writers thoughtfully. </p>

		<p>"Sarah, Helen, I want you to start working on this straight away." </p>

		<p>He stood up, raking a hand through his hair.</p>

		<p>"I don't want this to look like a ratings stunt, despite it being just that. And I don't want this to look like it's come out of no where. How are we going to work it in?"</p>

		<p>"You can find subtext between any characters if you look hard enough", Helen commented, twirling a pencil between her fingers. "Sarah and I can check out the sites and see what the fans are thinking. Like she pointed out earlier, Kennedy High does have a large gay/lesbian following so there has to be some talk about a possible Alex/Jeri romance".</p>

		<p>"Not to mention fan fiction", Sarah continued. </p>

		<p>"Don't read that though", Robert warned. "We don't want to get sued for stealing storylines. Just stick to websites and message boards, okay?"</p>

		<p>The writers nodded, scribbling down some notes. </p>

		<p>"We do have another little problem" Jack said. "How are we going to tell Sam and Brooke?"</p>

		<p>"Oh god" Robert groaned, dropping his head on the table with a loud thunk.</p>

		<p>"My thoughts exactly" Jack continued with a smirk. "We have enough trouble trying to get them on the same set to film their scenes together, can you imagine their reaction when we tell them their characters are becoming lovers?"</p>

		<p>Helen closed her eyes with a grimace, while Sarah put her face in her hands.</p>

		<p>"Oh god".</p>
