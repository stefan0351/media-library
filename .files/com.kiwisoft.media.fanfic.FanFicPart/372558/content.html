<p><b>Take Two</b></p>
<p><b>XxX41myeohmye14XxX's Sex Questionnaire</b> (Take Two)</p>
<p><b>1. Name?</b> Still extremely personal, by the way, but it's Mad Libby again. <i>What if I wanted to be Mad Libby?</i> You can't. Come up with something else. <i>Fine. I'm…Suzie Q.</i> How unoriginal. <i>I could be Sexy Q.</i> Better.</p>
<p><b>2. Reason for taking this?</b> My insane girlfriend is making me do it again so I won't talk about XXXX XX XXXXXXX this time. <i>What did you </i><i><u>just</u></i><i> say? Now I have to scribble it out.</i> May I just point out that your paranoia is reaching new heights? I'm getting concerned. <i>You know you think it's hot.</i> Anyway.</p>
<p><b>3. Sexual orientation (if you know)?</b> Bi. <i>Liar.</i> Currently a full-blown lesbian with a girlfriend. <i>That's better.</i></p>
<p><b>4. Which sex are the majority of your fantasies about?</b> They're pretty much all about Sexy Q. <i><u>Pretty</u></i><i> much?</i> Again, with the paranoia. All of my <u>sexual</u> fantasies are about you. <i>They better be</i>.</p>
<p><b>Have you ever:</b></p>
<p><b>5. …kissed someone?</b> Duh. <i>That wasn't very eloquent of you.</i> Are you going to comment on every single thing I say on this? <i>Probably.</i> How do you roll your eyes on paper? <i>RME.</i> Ah. RME to the tenth power. <i>That's not very nice. I'm withholding tonight.</i> No, you aren't.</p>
<p><b>6. Had sex?</b> Yes, I have. Several times. <i>And several more times tonight.</i> I told you you weren't withholding. <i>Damn you.</i> Now who's not being nice?</p>
<p><b>7. Dry humped?</b> Yes, indeed. <i>Have not.</i> Not with you. <i>Only with people we are </i><i><u>not</u></i><i> mentioning.</i> It's not my fault you can't keep your clothes on. <i>I can, too. You'll see.</i> Should I be worried? <i>Only if you're afraid of dry humping with a girl.</i></p>
<p><i>You are now permitted to answer this question with a yes.</i> Okay, so yes, I have. <i>And it was awesome.</i> Excellent.</p>
<p><b>8. Been walked in on?</b> No. Sexy Q is even sneakier than I am, actually, so the whole 'Coach Sylvester's desk' thing ended up working out after all. <i>You still owe me ten bucks.</i></p>
<p><b>9. Had someone watch?</b> Not to my knowledge, unless she's kinkier than I thought. <i>Ew, no. No one's allowed to see that but me.</i> Thank God.</p>
<p><b>10. Watched others have sex?</b> Still no. <i>Unless watching me counts.</i> I don't think that's what this was asking. <i>Oh. Well, I think it's worth mentioning.</i> You think any time I was in handcuffs is worth mentioning. <i>Come on, you know that was awesome.</i> Torturous is the word, Q.</p>
<p><b>11. Made out at a dance?</b> Yes. <i>OMG, Santana's face was hilarious.</i> I'd prefer not to think about that. <i>Well, don't think about </i><i><u>after</u></i><i> the facial expression.</i> It's impossible. The sounds of her gagging will haunt me forever. <i>You're so dramatic.</i> And you're just now realizing this…?</p>
<p><b>12. Had sex at a dance?</b> Of course not. <i>If stupid Santana hadn't shown up….</i> It still would've been no. <i>That's what you think.</i></p>
<p><b>13. Gone to a hotel just to have sex? </b>Well, that was really our only option after getting caught at the dance. <i>Good times. Their complimentary breakfast waffles were good.</i> The syrup was even better. <i>:D</i></p>
<p><b>14. Had sex on your parents's bed?</b> Again with the ew. <i>That would be gross. I don't want to think about that.</i></p>
<p><b>15. Had sex with your parents home, without them knowing?</b> Only because Sexy Q is really Horny Q. <i>It is not my fault that you decided to sing 'Touchin' On My' while clad in only your underwear.</i> I told you: I was changing into my pajamas. <i>Sure. And you decided to take a singing break between being dressed and undressed.</i> Yeah? <i>You're insane.</i> Look who's talking.</p>
<p><b>16. Had sex the first time you met someone?</b> No. As I said <i>We'll just leave it at that.</i> But <i>No.</i> Stop stealing my pen. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>17. Had sex at a movie?</b> So many times…. <i>You pick boring movies.</i> Right. And who was the one who begged to go see that Harry Potter movie? <i>I realized I'm Christian, so I think witchcraft is evil.</i> That is the lamest excuse I have ever heard. Or is it seen? <i>Read, probably.</i> Sounds good to me.</p>
<p><b>18. Had sex in a public place?</b> Since being with Q, I've broken this standard more times than I care to admit. <i>I win.</i></p>
<p><b>19. Had sex outdoors?</b> Surprisingly, no. <i>You were right the first time you filled this out. Bugs are gross. Your sweaters, however, could use a few grass stains.</i> I'm going to ignore that.</p>
<p><b>20. Had sex while driving?</b> Yes. And it's not a safe activity. <i>It was so fun.</i> You think almost driving into a ditch is fun? <i>No, but the sex part was.</i></p>
<p><b>21. Had sex with chocolate sauce, honey, etc.?</b> Again, so many times. Fortunately, my Sexy Q was smart enough to find a solution to the morning-after mess. <i>:D</i></p>
<p><b>22. Had sex sitting?</b> Yes. <i>What, no other comment? I'm hurt.</i> And it's hot. <i>Thank you.</i></p>
<p><b>23. Had sex standing?</b> Yes, often. <i>Because I'm cooler than the people we aren't mentioning.</i> Exactly.</p>
<p><b>24. Had sex with a virgin?</b> She was a virgin to lesbian sex, so I count it. <i>Stupid man we aren't mentioning.</i></p>
<p><b>25. Had sex with bondage?</b> I think this goes without saying. <i>Say it, anyway.</i> Of course I have. <i>And?</i> And it's more fun than I thought it would be. Especially when we mix in the chocolate and stripteasing. <i>I told you so….</i></p>
<p><b>26. Had sex with more than one person at a time?</b> N <i>No! Mine!</i> I was going to say no, but anyway.</p>
<p><b>27. Had sex with both a man and a woman (at different times)?</b> This question still makes no sense. <i>I think they mean have you had sex with both sexes. But they sort of already covered that.</i> See what I meant about the proofreading? This is ridiculous. <i>Chill.</i></p>
<p><b>28. Had sex with both a man and a woman (at the same time)?</b> <i>Why aren't you answering?</i> I was expecting a swift 'No, mine!' <i>Ah. Well, I think I've made my point. But still. Mine.</i></p>
<p><b>29. Had sex with 3 or more in the same night?</b> Definitely not. <i>Stupid question.</i></p>
<p><b>30. Teased someone successfully for over an hour?</b> Over two, once. <i>You are </i><i><u>so</u></i><i> good at that. We need to take a break. Right now.</i></p>
<p><b>31. Done a striptease?</b> I did just now, in fact, as part of the aforementioned teasing. <i>I don't know why you bothered putting your clothes back on.</i> Because you like ripping them off. <i>True.</i></p>
<p><b>32. Seen a striptease at a public establishment?</b> Still not old enough, and I can just ask Sexy Q now. <i>Anything for my Mad Libby.</i></p>
<p><b>33. Bought sexual aids? </b>Yes. <i>We have a special credit card. </i>Why is that pertinent information? <i>Because we have a credit card together.</i> … <i>Just trust me, it's important.</i></p>
<p><b>34. Used sexual aids?</b> Yes. <i>And?</i> With someone else now. <i>And?</i> It's sexy as all hell. <i>Language.</i> You know you like it. <i>;D</i></p>
<p><b>35. Seduced someone?</b> I've perfected the art. <i>You really have. But you should practice anyway. Right now. </i>We're almost to the end. Can't it wait? <i>Fine. I see how you are.</i></p>
<p><b>36. MADE your fantasy come true?</b> Many times over, in fact. <i>You could do it again…right now.</i></p>
<p><b>37. Caused someone who was straight or gay to become bisexual?</b> I think I may have actually pushed her all the way over to gay. <i>We could be gay together right now.</i> There are only five questions left.</p>
<p><b>Favorite:</b></p>
<p><b>38. Position?</b> That's an extremely tough call. <i>Well?</i> I'm thinking. <i>I am waiting….</i> Okay, I think I like any position where Sexy Q is above me, because she looks amazing with her hair cascading around her shoulders like that. <i>Okay, you don't get to answer any more questions until I have my way.</i></p>
<p><b>39. Dirty phrase?</b> I had one all picked out before that interruption. I think I may have a new one now, though. <i>Which one?</i> 'So tight, baby, all night.' <i>And I thought I was being corny.</i> I think it was the way you said it. <i>I'm good.</i></p>
<p><b>40. Fantasy?</b> I still love me a blonde cheerleader on a piano. <i>No new one?</i> What can I say? I'm consistent. <i>Well, yeah. Your life goal has been to take Broadway since you were like four. Months. </i>RME.</p>
<p><b>Last Few:</b></p>
<p><b>41. Did you like this questionnaire?</b> It's all right. <i>I lurv this questionnaire.</i> 'Lurv' isn't a word. <i>It is now.</i></p>
<p><b>42. Will you pass this on?</b> No. <i>I think we should give it to Brittany and Santana.</i> I don't think I want to know their answers to some of these. <i>You're no fun.</i> I am offended. <i>Is there any way I can make it up to you?</i> Horndog. <i>So are you. You just hide it better.</i> Sexy Q? <i>Yes, Mad Libby?</i> Shut up.</p>
