<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 31 -->

<p>Brooke moved her spoon around her cereal bowl restlessly as she stared at
the soggy flakes contemplatively.  She looked over at Sam who seemed to be
about as interested in finishing her breakfast as she herself was and
wondered if Sam was thinking about the same thing she was thinking about.
As she thought about this she noticed Sam look over at her.</p>

<p>"Have you been getting the feeling lately that you're…." Brooke started to
say.</p>

<p>"Being watched?  Yes.  I thought it was just me," Sam finished for her,
agreeing with the sentiment.  She had felt like she was constantly being
watched for a couple days, and had thought that she was being paranoid but
now she wasn't so sure.  "What about when you walk into a room.  Does
everything…" she continued.</p>

<p>"Suddenly go quiet?  Yes, totally," Brooke responded excitedly.  So she
wasn't going insane, it was just everyone else.</p>

<p>"Are you finding it as annoying as I am?" Sam asked making a face.  She was
beginning to feel like the chief suspect in a murder case.  Everyone was
eyeing her suspiciously but not saying anything directly to her, like they
expected her to pull out a knife and slice them with it or something.  It
was highly irritating.</p>

<p>"At least as much.  It's driving me insane," Brooke related tugging at her
ear.  She was used to people looking at her, but this was different.  It was
like they were judging her, or at least studying her.  She felt like one of
those single-celled organisms that they learned about in biology class.  She
decided that she didn't like being under a microscope.</p>

<p>"I'm a reporter, I should investigate," Sam said decisively.  Now that she
knew she wasn't making it up she wanted to know what was going on so that
she could make it stop.  Immediately.</p>

<p>"For once, I'm all for it," Brooke responded.  "Ouch!" the cheerleader
declared a moment later after Sam slapped her slightly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Behave," Sam instructed with a mock sternness.   "I have something for
you."</p>

<p>"Is it another punch?  Cause if it is I don't want it," Brooke replied
petulantly though she looked over at Sam expectantly.</p>

<p>Sam leaned over and kissed her on the cheek lightly.</p>

<p>"Is that okay?" Sam asked watching as Brooke's frown turned upside down.</p>

<p>"That's very okay," the blonde responded about to make an offering of her
own when Jane walked into the kitchen.</p>

<p>As Jane looked at them, she once again got the distinct impression that she
was interrupting something.  There was just something in their demeanor
when they were together that both charmed and alarmed her.  "You've still
got a few minutes," she said absently as she noticed them both start to
stand up.</p>

<p>Brooke looked down into her bowl, which now basically only continued a pile
of brown mush and turned to face Jane.  "That's okay," she responded.  And
with that she began to migrate towards the door.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam said halting her progress.  The cheerleader and her mother
both turned to look at her.  "Are you forgetting something?"  Brooke looked
at her quizzically.  Forgetting something?  Surely Sam didn't want a goodbye
kiss.  Her mother was standing right there, plus, they were going in the
same car.</p>

<p>Seeing the utterly confused look on the blonde's face, Sam held up her
school bag, then pointedly looked at Brooke's empty hands.  "Oh," Brooke
said suddenly.  "Oh," she repeated.  "I'll go get that."</p>

<p>As Brooke headed out of the room, Sam leaned against the doorway, rolled her
eyes up towards the ceiling, and boredly starting making clicking sounds
with her mouth, which eventually ran together forming a little song.  This
seemed to amuse her, because she smiled and then started to do it more
intently bobbing her head along to the beat.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Jane asked more to try and make her stop than anything
else.</p>

<p>"Just working on my music," Sam responded grinning at her mother, before
turning to stare lazily into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" Jane asked.  The question was more than a brilliant
bridge into a conversation that Jane had been wanting to have with her, she
was truly concerned.  For the past five days or so, Sam had been relatively
easy going, but before that her moods had been all over the place.  Jane now
believed she knew the cause of Sam's earlier depression, but she still
wanted to hear what her daughter had to say.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded turning to face her mother once again.  She had that
look on her face again.  That look Sam had come to dread.  It was an
inquisitive and sad look, and she had noticed her mother looking at her with
it for a while.  This look made her nervous, it wasn't a good look on Jane.
"Why?" Sam asked, a touch of suspicion clear in her voice.</p>

<p>"I'm a mother, we have to ask sometimes to feel like we're doing our jobs,"
Jane responded, hearing Brooke at the top of the stairs.  "And at the risk
of turning the conversation into a cheesy but informative social studies
video, I want you to know that if anything is bothering you … or if you're
confused about something or just want to talk I'm here for you."</p>

<p>"I know," Sam responded, avoiding her mothers eyes.  She wished that that
was true, she had always been close to her mother, and especially so after
her fathers death, but what was up with her was NOT something that you
talked to your mother about.  "I've always known," she continued with a
smile small, unable to say anything else yet wanting to comfort her mother
somewhat.</p>

<p>Jane nodded, then turned her head to watch Brooke's approach.  The blonde
held up her bag proudly with a smile.  "Remember when we were at grandma's
and the dog brought the bird it had killed to the diner table dropping it on
the floor proudly?" Sam asked as she to looked at Brooke and shook her head.
  "This reminds me of that…only the dog had something to be proud of."  Jane
turned to look at Sam, and couldn't help but laugh.</p>

<p>"What?"  Brooke asked reaching them.  The McPherson's just chuckled while
trying to act like they weren't.  "Come on what?" Brooke said, her voice
verging on whining.  Sam and Jane stopped for a moment and looked over at
her, then just when Brooke thought they were finally going to stop, they
started all over again.  Brooke could tell this was just going to be one
fabulous bitch of a day.</p>
