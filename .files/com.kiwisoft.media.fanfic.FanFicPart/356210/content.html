<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 14: She's Got A Ticket To The Road Trip From Hell -->

<p>"Oh God." Brooke said holding her hands over her forehead. "My head!"</p>
<p>"You drank a whole bottle of wine all by yourself yesterday."</p>
<p>"Please, don't remind me."</p>
<p>"I brought you breakfast. That will make you feel better."</p>
<p>"Thanks. Hey, what time is it?"</p>
<p>"It's almost twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>"Please tell me it's twelve o'clock at night."</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>"OMG Sam! I'm later for school." Brooke said jumping out of the bed and knocking over the tray spilling the food all over the bed.</p>
<p>"Relax!" Sam said grabbing Brooke's arm. "I called the school. Told them you had tonsillitis and couldn't talk."</p>
<p>"Oh..." Brooke sat down on the bed again. "I ruined my breakfast." She said looking at the bed with a miserable look on her face.</p>
<p>"You wanna go on a trip?"</p>
<p>Brooke's face light up. "What kind of trip?"</p>
<p>"I thought we could visit my friend Dawn in Sunnydale."</p>
<p>"Yeah. But why do you wanna go to that hell hole?"</p>
<p>"Hey, why's everybody calling Sunnydale a hell hole?"</p>
<p>"Cause it's a small town where people die all the time maybe?"</p>
<p>"People die here too you know."</p>
<p>"But not as much as in Sunnydale."</p>
<p>"Anyway Brooke, I really think you should come along on this trip."</p>
<p>"And why is that?" Brooke raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Cause I am going to prove to you that you are the father/mother of this child."</p>
<p>"Sammy..."</p>
<p>"And don't say no, because you really don't have a choice. If you love me and want to be with me, you better come along."</p>
<p>"For your information, I was going to say I'd love to go with you."</p>
<p>"Oh... Well, good for you!"</p>
<p>"Sam, why are you acting weird?"</p>
<p>"I'm confused. I don't really know what to do with all this. You really hurt me Brooke, when you threw me out of your room and disappeared the next day. Then to find you drunk, singing songs with a bunch of wasted surfers, let's just say it hasn't exactly been the funniest day in my life. But I want to work things out with you. I want you to believe me Brooke."</p>
<p>"I want to believe you Sam. But I'm also confused. I just don't know what to believe anymore. I don't want to lose you. I love you so much."</p>
<p>Tears started running down the Blonde's cheeks and Sam put her arms around Brooke holding her really close. They sat like that, holding each other, for a long time until Brooke's stomach started to riot and she had to stuff herself with food.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Are we there yet?"</p>
<p>"Nic, we've only been on the road for 10 minutes."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm bored already." Nicole sighed. "Why do I have to sit here in the back with these two, anyway?" Nicole shoot sideway glances at the two girls who were sitting on each of her sides; Carmen and Lily.</p>
<p>"Because Brookie was feeling a little bit nauseous and wanted to sit in the front with Sam." Said Mary Cherry who was driving the car.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry had picked the girls up in a lobster red mini-van with matching red fluffy interior. Brooke felt sick from the seats so she decided to ride in the front with Sam and Mary Cherry. Nicole had no choice but to sit in the back with Carmen and Lily since she was the last one to be picked up by the Mary Cherry-mobile and the two brunettes in the back insisted on window seats. No one in the back was actually happy with the seating arrangements. But when Nicole reminded herself why she was doing this, it felt a little bit better. She could go back to filing her nails instead of being annoyed by Lily frenetically chewing on carrots or Carmen's humming.</p>
<p>When Lily was done eating carrots, she had to find something else to entertain herself with. After a couple of minutes of trying to figure out whether Nicole had ever had a nose job or not, she caught Mary Cherry looking at her in the rear-view mirror. When Mary Cherry noticed Lily was looking at her she gave the brunette her best smile and a little wink. Lily smiled and winked back. And they kept doing that until Nicole looked up from filing her nails and noticed them looking at each other. The thought of Mary Cherry and Lily flirting was just too disturbing for Nicole so she decided to stall Mary Cherry for a while.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, where did you get this car?"</p>
<p>"It's momma Cherry's car." Mary Cherry answered not really giving Nicole much attention.</p>
<p>Nicole sighed. She wasn't interested in having an hour long conversation about a lobster red van with Mary Cherry if the blonde would continue flirting with Lily in the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, stop flirting with Lily."</p>
<p>Carmen was so shocked she spit out her soda all over Sam, Sam accedently knocked Brooke in the eye with her elbow, Lily almost choked on her flapjack and Mary Cherry almost drove into a car on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>"Now, was that really necessary?" Asked Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Don't ever do that again." Brooke said holding one hand over her eye and wiping away soda from Sam's face with the other.</p>
<p>"You almost killed Lily!" Carmen said.</p>
<p>"I was not flirting with Mary Cherry."</p>
<p>"Damn right l'il Lily!"</p>
<p>"Oh puh-lease! It's a wonder we...."</p>
<p>"Okay!" Brooke screamed. "All this drama is not good for the baby. So please; no more spitting soda over people or driving off the road."</p>
<p>"Whatever." Nicole pouted and crossed her arms over her chest.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Yaaay!" All the girls shouted at the same time when they passed the 'Welcome to Sunnydale' sign.</p>
<p>"Finally I can get away from Lily's hysterical chewing and Carmen humming show-tunes." Nicole said touching up her make-up in a small mirror.</p>
<p>"Hey Nic, I thought you said you are nice now." Sam said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"I've been sitting here with these two freaks and I haven't killed them yet. I think we can call that improvement."</p>
<p>Sam turned around with a chuckle while Carmen and Lily exchanged frightened looks. Carmen started to scratch at the door while nervously looking at Lily who was doing the same.</p>
<p>"Oh please," Nicole sighed, "like I would bother to kill you two and ruin my coat while doing it."</p>
<p>"Sam, do you know the address where Dawn lives?" Mary Cherry asked.</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Sam searched her pockets and gave the two blondes sitting with her a sheepish smile. "I kinda forgot it at home."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do now?"</p>
<p>"Maybe we could go in to a store and ask if anybody knows the Summers?"</p>
<p>"Okay hun, this town ain't that small." Nicole said.</p>
<p>"It's worth a try."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam and Lily stepped into a little kinda dark store that at first sight looked like a bookstore, but as they stepped in, it looked like a something-else. A girl was standing behind a counter looking utterly bored.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" She said.</p>
<p>"Okay, that what an interesting way to greet your costumers." Lily whispered.</p>
<p>"Uhm. Hi, I'm looking for someone named Dawn Summers, I wonder if you know her?"</p>
<p>"Know her? Hah! With my luck I'm stuck with that little brat forever."</p>
<p>"So you do know her?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, yes. Why? Are you coming to take her away?" The girl's face light up.</p>
<p>"Not really. We're here to visit her. Do you know where she lives?"</p>
<p>"Yes. How come you don't know where she lives, if you're here to visit her?"</p>
<p>"I forgot the address at home... and her phone number. So... Could you give us the address?"</p>
<p>"Sure. But if you're evil under disguise, you're in trouble."</p>
<p>"Pardon?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing." The girl wrote the address on a piece of paper and handed it to Sam.</p>
<p>"Okay... Thank you."</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
