<!-- The Closet \ Part Eighteen -->

<p>"It wasn't so bad," Sam said as she lay back on the bed.  She was
absolutely exhausted.  After she and Brooke had been freed from the
closet, they had remained at the museum for a few more hours to
straighten things out with the curator, then it had been onto the bus
were they were verbally accosted by Bio Glass for the entire ride back
to the hotel.  That's when things got rough.  Upon arriving at the
hotel they were forced to call their parents and explain why they had
gotten a call the other night telling them that their daughters had
disappeared.  Following that very painful conversation Glass grounded
them confining them to the hotel where they were to remain as
punishment until further notice.  Following this announcement Brooke
had been dragged by a raging Nicole up to her suite while Carmen, Lily
and Harrison followed Sam to her room to badger her to death.</p>

<p>"What do you mean it wasn't so bad?" Carmen responded dropping onto
the bed and consequently shaking Sam about.  "You can't just say it
wasn't so bad and leave it at that.  You and Brooke were trapped in a
confined space for an extended period of time and nobody sustained
serious injury.  That's something, that's more than not so bad, that's
a freaking miracle," she continued her voice raising in excitement as
she went on.</p>

<p>"She's not so bad," Sam stated simply, trying to contain the smile the
mere mention of Brooke's name threatened to bring to her face.</p>

<p>"You once said that she was a creature of pure evil," Harrison pointed
out.  "You were so flustered that you said that she couldn't be any
eviler on the evilest day of the year if she had an electrified evil
machine," he continued snickering at the description.  That one had
had him in stitches for days.</p>

<p>"Not my finest moment," Sam replied calmly, so calmly in fact that she
was beginning to freak her friends out.  "Still, Brooke's alright."</p>

<p>"Okay, who are you and what have you done with Sam?" Lily observing
Sam suspiciously.  Sam could tell that she was suspicious because her
eyes narrowed and her lips thinned, and she started to look really
constipated.</p>

<p>"I'm Sam and nobody's done anything to Sam because being Sam I would
know if something happened to Sam, which it didn't cause I'm Sam and I
know that nothing happened to Sam…I mean me, I mean…well you know what
I mean," Sam responded her brows scrunching together as she tried to
make sense of her own sentence before she decided that she didn't
really care.</p>

<p>"Alright, we'll assume that you're not some sort of Sam-bot…for the
moment," Carmen began, "but the fact still remains that you and
Brooke, sworn enemies, the closest thing that I've ever seen in
real-life to comic book style arch enemies, are getting along.  You
were like Archie and Reggie, now you're like Betty and Veronica.  This
is strange, this demands an explanation, an explanation we are still
waiting for" she concluded.</p>

<p>"We just had nothing to do in there but talk," Sam responded with a
rather exasperated sigh.  "I mean, as much as I bitched about her it
wasn't like if given the opportunity I really would have gone all
medieval on her ass or something.  We just decided that it would be
better if we tried not aggravate each other, and that led to talking,
and talking led to the realization that our fighting was more
posturing than loathing, and that well we can get along pretty well
when we want to," she continued turning to survey them.  "Come on,
this isn't like learning that I'm a crime fighter by night, or that
Glory is god.  You guys should be happy, you always said I should give
her a chance, now I have and I'm admitting that she's not a demon
spawn.  You win, this is probably the only time you're going to hear
me speak those words, so absorb or inhale or revel or whatever."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Sam raised her head and looked around at them.</p>

<p>"What?" Carmen asked.  "We're reveling.  Look at us revel."  Sam
looked, but to her reveling looked an awful lot like sitting.</p>

<p>"Don't you three have a Disney movie cum-Broadway production to go get
dressed for?  The circle of life is quickly spiraling by it, and it'll
be a good two or four years, cause even numbers seem so much more
symmetrical, before it'll be back," was Sam's response.  It was funny,
she had only been away from Brooke for about an hour but it already
seemed like a life time.  This being the case, she wanted her
love-den…um, room to be free of interlopers when the apple of her eye
returned.</p>

<p>"She's right!" Lily exclaimed jumping up.  "We have to get ready.  I
have to prepare my notes," she continued tugging on Carmen's arm
trying to get her to stand up.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you'll be alright?" Harrison asked as he opened the door
just in time for an arriving Brooke to squeeze by him and into the
room.</p>

<p>"Positive," Sam responded watching as the blonde crossed in front of
her bed.</p>

<p>"Alright, we'll see you later then," he said stepping out of the door.
 "And ladies, please behave," he added before shutting the door and
taking off down the hall behind Lily and Carmen.</p>

<p>"Who knew having friends could be such a drag on one's social life?"
Brooke asked sighing dramatically as she flopped down onto the bed
next to Sam.  "I mean really, it's like they think I have nothing
better to do.  Of course as far as they know I did have nothing better
to do…but you and I know better don't we?" she continued turning her
head so that she was looking at Sam.</p>

<p>"How'd it go?" Sam asked smiling at Brooke fondly, she liked it when
Brooke was goofy like that, it made her eyes seem to twinkle and left
her mouth permanently unturned in the cutest way, like she couldn't
get enough of her own wit and charm.  It was an expression that Sam
would have found terribly narcissistic on anyone else, but that
disarmed her coming from Brooke.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so bad, I was verbally assaulted by Mary Cherry who was
somehow under the impression that my stay in the closet had damaged my
hearing and therefore felt the need to stand beside me and yell
directly into my ear whenever she spoke, and Nicole kept sniffing me
in a way that was really quite creepy muttering how she could smell
Spam on me, but other than that it went well I think," Brooke replied
as her eyes drifted to the ceiling.  "I got a manicure and a facial."</p>

<p>"Really?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Uh huh.  Apparently I deserved something extra special for the trauma
that I went through last night," Brooke responded grinning at Sam.
"And you know what they say about…something about gift mouths and
horses…" she went on trailing off as she became distracted by Sam's
smile and felt the need to watch it and be warmed.</p>

<p>"Actually," Sam said shifting forward so that she and Brooke were
lying pressed up against each other.  "The saying," she started
brushing her lips against Brooke's, "goes" she said before extending
her tongue and licking the blonde's bottom lip, "don't," she went on
arching her body against Brooke's teasingly, "look, a gift horse in
the mouth," she concluded before pressing her lips against Brooke's
drawing the blonde into a deep, passionate kiss that left them both
breathless.</p>

<p>"You know," Brooke started running her hand up Sam's side once they
broke away, "I'm pretty sure that I could mess up a few more sayings
if you'll correct me like that every time."  Her lips were now
hovering just in front of Sam's, the air between them filled with
electricity.  "There was something about there always being other fish
in your tea.  I always found that one strange."</p>

<p>"Sea, other fish in the sea," Sam corrected dipping her head down
where she trailed a line of kisses down Brooke's neck.</p>

<p>"That definitely makes more sense," Brooke responded in a half moan as
she leaned her head back to give Sam better access.  "What about that
one about education being the key to good dress?"</p>

<p>"Success," Sam whispered as her hand found it's way under Brooke's
shirt.  "Education is the key to success," she continued as she hand
explored the soft skin of Brooke's stomach while her lips returned to
work on her neck.</p>

<p>"And the early bird gets the perm?" Brooke asked her breath coming in
short gasps.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked as she nudged Brooke to the side and rolled on top
of her.  "Shut up," she continued before capturing taking the blonde's
willingly lips captive.</p>
