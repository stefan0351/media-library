<!-- About a Girl \ Part 13 -->

<p>"What did she say?" Katie asked worriedly looking over at Jessie. The other girl had hardly said a word to her after they left the gym, and they had already lapped the field once now in complete silence.</p>

<p>"Were you in love with her?" Jessie said careful to keep her tone neutral. Between the way Sarah had been acting towards her from when they first met on the play and today, and Grace's statement about how she and Katie had been madly in love with each other, Jessie was beginning to wonder if there was some truth to it. She just couldn't fathom Sarah acting the way that she was if they hadn't been together, she couldn't conceive of any other reason for the pain and anger that laced the girls every word.</p>

<p>"With Sarah?" Katie asked, her tone indecipherable.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded quietly.</p>

<p>"No," Katie replied a moment later, her eyes drifting around the open field before them before she continued. "But she was. With me. At least that's what she said afterwards," she continued sighing softly. "We'd always kinda talked, but last summer … I don't know, I guess we just started hanging out more…common bond or something," she went on playing with her index finger nervously. "One night, we were down in her basement listening to music or something and she kissed me, and it felt better than any kiss I'd had before so I let her do it again. It didn't really change anything … as far as I was concerned. I liked her, but no more than my luggage," she said recalling a line from one of her favorite movies. "I guess it changed things for her though. She got attached, way attached. Way more than me. I guess I led her on, cause I'd kiss her too sometimes … but I was just playing around. I didn't realize how serious she was until after the play started. Until after I met you.</p>

<p>"She knew, you know, that I liked you. And that's when she started getting all pissy. I'm sure you remember," Katie continued sighing at the memory of Sarah harassing Jessie about anything she could think of whenever they were in the same room. "After one of the fittings, I took her outside to ask her what the hell she thought she was doing. I was pretty upset, I'd wanted to make a good impression," she went on shaking her head. "She started crying and yelling at me, asking if I thought she was stupid. I had no idea what she was talking about, and just asked her why she had to try and ruin things, you know, any chance I had to get to know you. She looked like I'd slapped her across the face or something, and that's when I knew that she'd been in totally different place to me on whatever it was we were doing. She walked away, and that was that," Katie finished finally gathering up the nerve to look over at Jessie. </p>

<p>"So you didn't get bored of her?" Jessie asked her eyes focused on the ground as it depressed under her feet. </p>

<p>"No," Katie said surprised. "Is that what she told you? That I used her or something?"</p>

<p>"She said you were a player," Jessie admitted softly. "That I was just the newest thing."</p>

<p>"Player?" Katie repeated incredulously, as if she didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the description. Shaking her head, she turned to glance at Jessie who was still staring at her feet as they walked along, looking no happier than when they first exited the gym. "You believed her?" Katie said softly, her stomach suddenly feeling queasy. "You're still wondering if it's true, if you're just … convenient."</p>

<p>"I didn't," Jessie replied immediately hearing Katie's tone. "I don't," she continued, but her denial lacked a certain conviction and Katie picked up on it, on the hesitation, on the lack of feeling behind the words.</p>

<p>"Do you…" Katie started coming to a stop. "How could you think that this is game for me?" she asked her voice rising, the pain she was feeling at the attack on her character, her motivations, and her feelings hitting Jessie like an arrow to the heart.</p>

<p>"I don't," Jessie said, her voice vehement this time as she stepped towards Katie.</p>

<p>Katie flinched away from Jessie taking another step back, her eyes accusing as she spoke. "But you did, you did believe her," she responded.</p>

<p> "It wasn't that I thought you were using me," Jessie replied stepping towards Katie again only to have the other girl take another step back. "I was just scared." </p>

<p>"That I was using you," Katie supplied somewhat bitterly. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded matter of factly. "But it didn't really have anything to do with you. I hadn't thought about rationally or decided anything. And I didn't think that Sarah was such an upstanding citizen or something, I just," Jessie said her voice cracking with emotion. "I just got really scared, like crazy scared, that I would wake up one day … and not be your girl," she went on struggling to hold back tears. "I didn't believe it, but it freaked me anyway, cause being with you is like the best thing that's ever happened to me. And the thought … the idea of not being with you terrifies me. I mean, you're the first thing I think about when I wake up, if I wasn't already thinking about you, and when you're around like even silence is like good, and …" </p>

<p>"Jessie," Katie said gently taking a step forward and placing her hand on Jessie's shoulder. "Stop," she continued biting her bottom lip. "I get it. I do," she went on softly. "I…I feel the same way. About you. You're like my sun. And it's like if you ever stopped shining on me I would … I don't know, but it'd really really, really, suck." </p>

<p>"Really?" Jessie asked smiling through the tears that had started to run down her face as she spoke. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie responded. "Totally," and then Jessie's lips were on hers and they were kissing. Messily, hungrily, desperately bringing their lips together as they clung to one and other like life preservers. </p>

<p> "I don't want to go back in there," Jessie said softly when they broke apart. </p>

<p>"Then we won't," Katie replied smiling as she took Jessie's hand into hers. "Come on." </p>

<hr>

<p>Jessie tipped her head back, pressing her lips against the soft skin of Katie's neck and keeping them there for a minute as she felt her girlfriends low moan reverberate through her. Smiling, she turned slightly in Katie's arms and rested her head on her shoulder contentedly. After leaving the school they'd driven out to a place Katie liked to call `her own little piece of nowhere' and gotten out of the car. Katie had left the radio on and they'd settled down on the ground, somehow coming to be in the position they were currently occupying. Katie sitting with her back leaned up against a tree, and Jessie curled up warmly in her arms. And there they sat quietly together, in their own little garden.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Jessie mumbled into Katie's shoulder minutes or maybe hours after they arrived.</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked, her voice sounding dreamlike and far away.</p>

<p>"I love this song," Jessie replied happily taking Katie's hand into her own as the music swept over her.</p>

<p>"Some say a heart is just like a wheel When you bend it, you can't mend it And my love for you is like a sinking ship And my heart is like that ship out in mid ocean</p>

<p>They say that death is a tragedy It comes once and it's over But my only wish is for that deep dark abyss 'Cause what's the use of living with no true lover</p>

<p>And it's only love, and it's only love That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out"</p>

<p>A gentle evening breeze. Rustling leaves. "I think I'm in love with you."</p>

<p>A smile with closed eyes, pressing closer. "I was just thinking the same thing."</p>
