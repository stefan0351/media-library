<P><B>well, you guys are just lucky i guess, cuz i was totally in the mood to write the next chapter (since i had an awesome idea about it) so here you go, chapter 4! i hope you like it! :)</B></P><P>After we finished eating, we all went to Hollister, Abercrombie, and (wince) Claire's for Oliver, then Pacsun, Lids, and Journeys for Lilly. Needless to say, I was way more cooperative with Lilly's choices than Oliver's. I mean, even if he's gay, what kind of guy <I>wants</I> to go to Claire's? It's an accessory store for 12-year-old girls. Not only did he drag us there, but he made a purchase. He bought a rainbow bracelet (surprise, surprise). I'm sorry, but Oliver is just weird.</P><P>Now we're in the car, driving home. Lilly's already dropped Oliver off at his house, and now we're heading home so she can help me dye the pink streaks in my hair.</P><P>"So, I was talking to Oliver earlier," I mention, turning down the radio a few notches.</P><P>"Yeah? What about? Which dick-shaped eraser he should buy at Claire's?" she asks with a smirk.</P><P>"Oh damn aren't those like the grossest things ever? And they're selling them to <I>kids, </I>that's the sad thing. Although I'm sure they don't realize it, those erasers are totally shaped like cocks."</P><P>"Right? I don't know how they get away with that."</P><P>"I don't either. Anyway, no, that wasn't the conversation. It was about you, actually."</P><P>She looks genuinely surprised, and slightly worried. "Really?"</P><P>"Yeah. He told me how the two of you met at a GSA meeting."</P><P>"Let me guess, you had no idea what a GSA was."</P><P>"Not a clue, but he explained it to me. That's cool, that you're a part of that."</P><P>Now, she looked extremely surprised. "Seriously?"</P><P>"Well, yeah. Why would I say that as a joke?" She doesn't respond, just keeps driving. "What, did you think I was homophobic or something?" Again, no response. "You do realize that I just spent the entire day with the biggest fairy on this planet, right?"</P><P>Finally, a reply. "Duh. I was there."</P><P>"So why would you think I'd be freaked about gay people?"</P><P>"I don't know."</P><P>We stop talking for a few minutes, and I stare out the window. "Anyway, I had a reason for bringing this up. I asked him which side you were on, and he didn't give me an answer, so I figured I'd ask you."</P><P>Hesitantly, she says slowly, "Which side I'm on?"</P><P>"Yeah. Are you one of the straight kids or gay kids?"</P><P>Her face gets all flushed and she doesn't answer me as we pull into our driveway. "Come on, we'd better get a move on if we're gonna dye your hair tonight."</P><P>She climbs out of her side and slams the door, walking quickly into the house without checking to make sure I was following. I grab my bags and get out of her car, locking the doors before I closed mine, and follow her into the house. When I walk in I'm immediately greeted by Robby Ray and Blondie. They're sitting on the couch together watching the 6 o'clock news. Dad's arm is around Blondie's shoulders.</P><P>"How was the mall?" Dad asks.</P><P>"Didn't you already ask Lilly when she walked in?"</P><P>"Maybe, but now we're asking you."</P><P>"Right, ' we.' You mean you and Blondie."</P><P>"Her name is Heather, Miley, and that's how you're going to address her."</P><P>"Sure, whatever you say, Daddy Dearest," I say, walking towards my room. I think he might've called after me, but I can't be positive; I wasn't listening.</P><P>When I reach my room, Lilly is already there. She's only in her bra and underwear, and doesn't seem to notice that I've opened the door.</P><P>Okay, so maybe I linger there a little longer than I should. But I can't help it. She's wearing hot pink lingerie with black lace trim. I mean, seriously? You don't wear something like that unless you <I>want </I>somebody to catch you in it and stare. So, that's what I do. Thing is, after she pulls on some sweatpants and turns around to see me staring, she doesn't seem quite like she wanted me to see her.</P><P>"Miley!" she exclaims, "You could knock before you just burst in here, ya know!" She quickly grabs an old t-shirt off the bed and throws it on.</P><P>"Right. Let me just knock on <I>my </I>door to enter <I>my </I>room. Good idea." I throw my bags in the corner and throw myself on the bed. Since she moved in here, get this, we've had to <I>share </I>a bed. Dad says 'It's just like a sleepover!' Okay, Dad, sure it is. More like creepy.</P><P>"So are we gonna dye your hair or not?" She asks, clearly ignoring my remark and crossing the room to fish in my Hot Topic bag for the hair dye stuff. She finds it and walks into the bathroom connected to our room, setting it up on the counter, then comes back to get me. Slapping me on the butt, she says "Come on, lazy-ass. I can't dye your hair while you lay on the bed."</P><P>"Could you try?"</P><P>"Not for you, so get your cute little ass up and bring it to the bathroom."</P><P>"Cute?" I ask with a smirk, sliding off the bed.</P><P>"Uh...um...that's not what I meant. Just come on." Lilly tucks her hair behind her ears and stumbles nervously to the bathroom.</P><P>I guess the stupid Step-Sister Bonding Day actually did its job, because some time in the several hours we spent at the mall, Lilly and I actually became...friends.</P><P>"Alright, alright, I'm here," I say as I walk in and plop down on top of the toilet (don't worry, the lid's down). "You can dye now."</P><P>"Why don't you?"</P><P>"I meant you can dye my hair, smartass."</P><P>"I know." She slips on the latex gloves and opens the bleach kit box, reading the instructions. "I need a bowl."</P><P>"Duh. Go get one."</P><P>Lilly looks at me with a defiant expression. "Now who's being the smartass? Why don't you go get it?"</P><P>"Because I already had to deal with Dad and Blond-I mean Heather-when I came in, and I'm not in the mood to do it again."</P><P>"Maybe if you didn't act like such a bitch you could just breeze right through their conversations, without having to 'deal with them.' " Okay, so we're back to square one: forced step-sisters.</P><P>"I like being a bitch," I say argumentatively.</P><P>"No you don't."</P><P>"Yes I do."</P><P>She looks at me carefully, scrutinizing my face, and especially my eyes. "No. You don't." With that, she just walks right out of the room, I'm guessing to go get a bowl.</P><P>What's that supposed to mean? <I>No. You don't. </I>How would she know? And what was with the way she looked at me? It was like she was trying to see right through me, like she was trying to get inside my head. Dangerous place. I wouldn't advise it.</P><P>"Back," she announces, bowl in hand.</P><P>"That was quick."</P><P>"Yeah. Running into the parentals doesn't always have to be a 10-minute ordeal."</P><P>"I get your point, Obedient Olivia, you can shut up now."</P><P>"My name is Lilly."</P><P>I don't even respond to that. She starts stirring the mix with the included brush as I sit and watch. "We're gonna need foil."</P><P>"Got it." She whips out a box of aluminum foil from behind her back.</P><P>"Of course you did," I mutter under my breath.</P><P>"Okay, how many streaks do you wanna add, and where?"</P><P>"I dunno. Just grab strands of my hair and bleach it."</P><P>"You're really gonna trust me to bleach your hair the way I want to?"</P><P>I mull this over. "You're right. I'll pick them out. Before I do, though, we need music." I walk back into our room and hit the stereo on, tuning it to a mix station. The song "My Immortal" by Evanescence streams through the speakers mid-verse. I stroll back into the bathroom and sit back down.</P><P>"I like this song," Lilly says as I grab a small shock of hair and hold it out to her to grab. Our hands briefly touch as she takes it from me.</P><P>"Good for you."</P><P>She brushes bleach from the bowl onto the bunch of hair I handed her with a rectangle of foil underneath. "You know, you don't have to be all surly and hostile all the time. You could always try being, oh, I don't know, nice?"</P><P>"Sure, okay. I'll get right on that."</P><P>"That's exactly what I'm talking about. Pick another streak."</P><P>I gather another group of strands together and hold them up for her. Our hands brush again. "What do you mean?"</P><P>"Well," she replies, painting the bleach on, "you're always sarcastic and shit. Why don't you ever try to cooperate with everyone?"</P><P>"Why should I have to? People are absurd."</P><P>"Oh, okay," she says with a chuckle, "People are absurd?"</P><P>"Yes, people are absurd." Evanescence fades out as an unfamiliar rap song comes on.</P><P>"If you ever gave them the chance, maybe they'd prove you wrong."</P><P>"They never have before."</P><P>"Maybe you weren't trying hard enough. Pick another streak."</P><P>I grabbed another bunch and hold it out to her. I don't think I need to tell you what goes on between our hands. "I try plenty hard."</P><P>"You dress in all black with chains and heavy boots and dark make-up and put random colored streaks in your hair."</P><P>"Since when does conforming equate to trying to get along?"</P><P>"Maybe if you didn't go out of your way to be different, people wouldn't be scared of you."</P><P>"People are not scared of me," I scoff.</P><P>"Some are."</P><P>"Name one."</P><P>She doesn't even have to pause to think. "Melissa London."</P><P>"Melissa London is a band geek with headgear."</P><P>"Melissa London is a talented violinist who likes to watch horror films and eat gummy worms and read Agatha Christie-type murder mystery novels."</P><P>"How do you know Melissa London that well?"</P><P>This time, there's a pause. "We used to be close."</P><P>"What do you mean?"</P><P>Before she has to answer, a familiar song comes on, and Lilly takes off one glove to go turn the volume up. "I love this song."</P><P>"This song is old."</P><P>"It's not that old."</P><P>"Whatever. I can't even remember the name."</P><P>" 'She Will Be Loved' by Maroon 5."</P><P>"Right, that one."</P><P><I>I don't mind spendin' every day</I></P><P><I>Out on her corner in the poorin' rain, oh</I></P><P><I>Look for the girl with the broken smile</I></P><P><I>Ask her if she wants to stay a while</I></P><P><I>And she will be loved,</I></P><P><I>She will be loved</I></P><P>Lilly starts to sing along, and I listen. She has a pretty good voice. On an instrumental break, she says, "Another streak."</P><P>I divide another one away from the others and hold it out. And, what ladies and gentlmen? Our hands brushed against each other. This time, though, they lingered together for just a moment more.</P><P>"My mom always told me to be who I was, no matter what. So that's what I do."</P><P>"Being who you are doesn't mean you have to try and intimidate and isolate everyone else."</P><P>"How would you know?"</P><P>"Because I'm me every day and I've got a bunch of friends."</P><P>"Well aren't you Ms. Popular?"</P><P>"I'm serious."</P><P>"Well being you is easy. You're all blonde and peppy and popular and easy to get along with."</P><P>It takes a while, but finally, she says, "You just don't get it."</P><P>"What? What don't I get?"</P><P>She stares at me, hard, just like before. "Forget it. Pick another streak."</P><P><B>sorry for any errors in the lyrics, i was going off of memory. anyway, review and tell me what you think.</B></P>
