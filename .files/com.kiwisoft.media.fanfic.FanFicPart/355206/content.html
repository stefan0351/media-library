<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Sweet Interlude -->

<p>"I'm bored," Nicole complained as she hung her head over the
edge of the bed in Sam and Brooke's motel room. The four of them were in yet
another nameless midwestern town on their way to Brooke's aunt's house in Texas
and aside from small diners and miscellaneous little tourist traps that they
stopped at when the whim hit, they hadn't spent much time having `fun'. Nicole
was desperate for a little mindless fun and she knew the other three girls with
her on this strange trip were too, she could tell by the bored expressions on
their faces. </p>
<p>"So am I," Lily agreed. She was sitting further up on the bed
half-asleep even though it was only five in the afternoon. There was nothing on
the television to keep her interest and they'd taken the day off from driving
because she'd been sick the day before. She felt fine and like Nic was up to
doing something more than sitting in the motel gathering dust. </p>
<p>"Want some cheese to go with that whine?" Sam asked
sarcastically from the table where she was playing cards quietly with Brooke.
Brooke snickered and reached for another card. She set down a set of 6, 7, 8 in
clubs and smiled at Sam who groaned. </p>
<p>"Crap," Sam swore as she noticed she was quickly losing the
game. </p>
<p>"Very funny, Spam," Nicole shot back as she rolled over onto
her stomach and reguarded the two girls at the table. Brooke had a pile of cards
on her side and Sam had three. Nicole smiled. She loved to see Sam lose at
things like that. </p>
<p>"What would you suggest we do?" Brooke asked absently as she
watched Sam stick her tongue out the side of her mouth as she concentrated on
her cards and thought. The poor brunette journalist was going to lose, again,
and just didn't want to admit it. It was cute, in Brooke's opinion. </p>
<p>"I don't know," Nicole sighed. "Anything's better than sitting
around here going grey." </p>
<p>"How about going out to eat?" Lily suggested. Nicole groaned. </p>
<p>"I don't know if my figure can handle another greasey spoon,
Lil," she complained sourly. Lily chuckled and laid down next to Nicole.
</p>
<p>"I'll still love you, even chubby and pudgey, Niki," Lily
joked, pinching Nicole's cheek in that annoying way relatives do. Nicole batted
her away feigning annoyance but smiling. </p>
<p>"Oh, you're funny," she scoffed at Lily. Lily stuck out her
tongue. </p>
<p>"What about that little bar place we saw, the Rhythm Café?"
Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"Ah, underage ring a bell?" Sam reminded her. Brooke rolled
her eyes. </p>
<p>"The sign said that Mondays through Thursdays were 16 and up,
today is Tuesday," Brooke said. </p>
<p>"Gay night," Nicole snickered. Three heads looked at her in
confusion. </p>
<p>"Huh?" Sam said. Nicole laughed. </p>
<p>"In some circles, at some bars, Tuesday nights are gay nights.
Or so I've heard," she added as an afterthought. </p>
<p>"So let's go," Brooke said as she set down her last three
cards, effectively beating Sam. Sam growled and tossed down her cards in
frustration mumbling something about cheating but Brooke ignored her. Nicole and
Lily hopped up off the bed. </p>
<p>"Really?" Nicole asked hopefully. She was REALLY bored.
</p>
<p>"Why not? It's not like we've got anything else better to do,"
Brooke said as she stood up and grabbed her coat. "Come on, sore loser, we're
going out to play," she said to Sam who was still pouting. Sam stood up and
joined the other girls. </p>
<p>"Lead the way, I'm ready for anything," she said as she
grabbed Brooke's hand. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The Rhythm Café was a small bar with a jukebox in one corner
and a small dance floor in the other. Two pool tables lined the opposite wall
away from the dance floor and aside from the bar, booths and tables occupied all
other spots. And Nicole was right, judging from the evening's clientele, it was
gay night. It wasn't particularly busy, just pleasantly buzzing with activity
with a relaxed atmosphere that all four girls immediately liked. </p>
<p>"Table for four, please?" Brooke asked when they walked in.
The doorman nodded with a smile and ushered them to a table halfway between the
jukebox and dance floor but away from the flow of traffic. After ordering sodas,
they settled into their seats and watched the activity around them. </p>
<p>"I like this place all ready," Lily said with a smile. "No
smoking." </p>
<p>"I could do without the country music," Nicole sighed,
referring to the Boot Scootin' Boogie currently assaulting her ears. Lily arched
an eyebrow at her. </p>
<p>"I thought you liked all kinds of music?" she teased. Nicole
rolled her eyes and mock glared at her. </p>
<p>"I do, even country music if there's a message behind it. But
the `my wife left me, my truck broke down, my dog died, and my rifle won't
shoot' music is just annoying," Nic clarified. Everyone at the table laughed at
her somewhat biased but still accurate description of country music. They
watched the couples, most of them obviously in love, on the dance floor. Lily
grabbed Nicole's hand. </p>
<p>"Come on, Nic, let's dance," she said, hauling Nicole up.
Nicole sighed dramatically. </p>
<p>"OK, fine," she said resigned although there was nothing else
she'd rather do. Brooke and Sam watched them go. </p>
<p>"You wanna dance?" Sam asked Brooke. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not yet. I'd rather just sit with you for a little while,"
she said putting her hand over Sam's on the table. Sam smiled lovingly at her. </p>
<p>"I'd like that too," she agreed. She watched as Brooke just
stared at her for a few minutes with a strange smile on her face. </p>
<p>"What, Brooke? What is that smile for?" she asked curiously.
Brooke shook her head but the smile didn't fade. </p>
<p>"I just." she started and stopped, wanting to say so much but
not knowing the words. She looked at Sam intently again. "You know I have no
regrets, right?" Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Me either," Sam told her. </p>
<p>"Good, I'm glad. But there's more to it than that. Sam, you
are more to me than I ever imagined possible. God, that sounded pathetic," she
sighed. </p>
<p>"No it didn't," Sam argued, touched by the sentiment.
</p>
<p>"But it's not what I wanted to say, what I need to say,"
Brooke tried to explain. </p>
<p>"Brooke, you don't need to explain anything. I know you love
me and I love you too. That's all either of us need to know." </p>
<p>Brooke sighed. She didn't know why but tonight there was so
much she needed Sam to understand. But Sam was the wordsmith, not her and she
was finding herself sorely lacking when she needed it the most. She ran a
frustrated hand through her hair as Sam watched confused. She watched Nicole and
Lily dancing and thought maybe there was another way to make Sam understand what
she was trying to say. Without a word, she stood up and walked to the jukebox,
hoping to find the selection she wanted. Upon finding it, she plunked some
quarters in, returned to Sam and extended her hand. </p>
<p>"Dance with me now, Sammy?" she asked. Sam smiled and took her
hand. </p>
<p>"Every dance is yours, forever, love," Sam answered. Brooke
lead her to the dance floor as the opening strains to the song she'd chosen
filled the bar and she held Sam tightly to her as they danced. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">((It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart <br>
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark <br>
Try as I may I could never explain <br>
What I hear when you don't say a thing </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The smile on your face <br>
Let's me know that you need me <br>
There's a truth in your eyes <br>
Saying you'll never leave me <br>
The touch of your hand <br>
Says you'll catch me if ever I fall <br>
You say it best <br>
When you say nothing at all </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">All day long I can hear people talking out loud <br>
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd <br>
Old Mr. Webster could never define <br>
What's being said between your heart and mine </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The smile on your face <br>
Let's me know that you need me <br>
There's a truth in your eyes <br>
Saying you'll never leave me <br>
The touch of your hand <br>
Says you'll catch me if ever I fall <br>
You say it best <br>
When you say nothing at all </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The smile on your face <br>

<p>Brooke could feel Sam's frame trembling with a chuckle as the
song ended and Sam turned her head so that her mouth was beside Brooke's ear. </p>
<p>"I understand what you were trying to say now," Sam whispered
and Brooke knew she did. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily watched her two friends with a wide smile. (Those two are
so in love) she thought happily. Most of the crowd had left the dance floor to
the two of them once they'd started to dance, realizing that it was a private
moment. But neither Sam nor Brooke had even noticed. They'd simply held each
other like there were no other people on the planet and Lily supposed for those
three and a half minutes, there wasn't. </p>
<p>"They're so sweet I think I'm going into insulin shock,"
Nicole gagged from her seat. Lily swatted her on the shoulder. </p>
<p>"Jealous?" she teased. Nic `hurumphed'. </p>
<p>"As if. Besides, I've got you. I got the better end of the
deal," she said with a small smile. Lily smiled back at her. </p>
<p>"Flatterer," she joked. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"It's the truth." </p>
<p>"Want me to play a song for you?" Lily asked only
half-kidding. Nicole scrunched her nose. </p>
<p>"Eh, don't bother. Besides, I'm not really one for receiving
sentimental stuff," Nicole pointed out. "I love to give stuff to you and do
stuff for you but don't feel obligated to do anything for me. It's a waste of
effort." Lily sighed. She kind of wanted to play a song for Nicole like Brooke
had for Sam. And she decided she was going to anyway. Without saying anything to
Nicole, she walked to the jukebox and flipped through her choices. Finally
finding something at least halfway decent, she put in her quarters and returned
to Nicole. </p>
<p>"Tough, I bothered," she informed Nicole. Nicole shrugged with
a happy smile. </p>
<p>"Suit yourself, Lil," she said plainly although she was almost
glowing and Lily knew she'd made the right choice in doing this little thing.
She grabbed Nicole's hand and pulled her back out onto the floor, watching as
Nic grabbed some cowboy's hat on the way by and set it on top of her short
blonde hair. It was a good look for her. They started to line dance to the song
and were eventually joined by Brooke and Sam. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">((Yeah <br>

Baby I love you)) </font> </p>
<p>And for one night at least, in a small little bar in a little
no name town somewhere between L.A. and Austin, reality stopped hunting the four
girls and they enjoyed themselves. They forgot the turmoil, the pain and grief
that awaited them and just lost themselves in the music, the moment and each
other. </p>
<p><font color="#3399FF">The first song, `When You Say Nothing At All'
was originally by Keith Whitley, I believe but the version I was using is by
Alison Krauss from her `Now That I've Found You' album ©1995.
And the second song, `I Love You' is by Martina McBride from her `Greatest Hits'
album ©2001. Both are used without permission and I'm
making no money off of it. I'm just a humble fan. =) </font> </p>
