<!-- Flip Sides Of The Same Coin -->


<p>After returning from rehab, Sam toweled herself off after a
quick shower and carefully went about getting dressed without
assistance.  She idly wondered if hitting Brooke over the head with a
large rainbow colored object would be too obvious. &lt;Maybe make her
listen to Melissa Etheridge all day?  Nah, she's a cheerleader; she
still wouldn't get the point&gt;</p>

<p>She sat on her bed and thought about her rather brazen declaration
that she was looking for trouble.  &lt;God, I'll be lucky if SHE doesn't
run me over with her car now.  What was I thinking?  Brooke doesn't
see me an anything other than a friend, a sister-to-be despite
whatever friendly flirting we do.  She's just practicing with me
until the next bronze Adonis comes along to take her away from me&gt;
she lamented.  &lt;Although, she had a pretty strong grip on me when I
woke up this morning&gt; she remembered.  &lt;And if I keep thinking along
these lines, I'm going to need another shower, a COLD one&gt;</p>

<p>She was in the middle of fastening her bra when the door opened and
in walked Brooke.</p>

<p>"Hey, Sam, have you seen my hairbrush?" Brooke stopped short as Sam
sat there with her bra in one hand and a shocked look on her face.
Brooke blushed.  She had helped Sam dress but usually Sam wore a
sports bra and Brooke had never actually seen her, ah, naked.  Sam
let out a small yelp.</p>

<p>"Knock much, Brooke?" she asked, embarrassed.  Her voice was quiet.
Brooke brought one hand up to her eyes to shield them and Sam rolled
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," Brooke started.  Sam sighed.  She was embarrassed,
yes, but what was done was done.</p>

<p>"Whatever.  You wanna shut the door before you give Mike and Mom a
show and REALLY make them wonder about that comment you made at
breakfast this morning?" Brooke still didn't budge.  Sam glanced down
at her chest.  There was still some scarring but she didn't think it
was that bad.  She frowned.  "What?  Am I that ugly?" she asked, hurt
and insult creeping into her voice.</p>

<p>Brooke dropped her hand and to her disappointment and elation &lt;Is
that possible?&gt; Sam still hadn't covered herself.  Sam's face bore a
look of confusion mixed with hurt and a little fear.  Brooke shook
her head as she shut the door.</p>

<p>"No, Sam," she answered, amazed at how normal her voice sounded given
how shakey she actually felt inside.  She was seriously contemplating
another cold shower.  "You're not ugly.  Far from it.  You look
fine.  Better than fine actually.  I was just surprised, is all.  And
embarrassed, for you." Sam shrugged both in relief and confusion at
Brooke's statements. &lt;I really wish I could figure her out.  She
confuses the Hell out of me sometimes.  So she doesn't think my
breasts are ugly, that's a plus&gt;</p>

<p>"Well, you've seen them now, can't change that.  I got tired of the
sports bra and since we're going shopping for clothes I thought I'd
go for a real bra for a change," she explained as she resumed trying
to fasten the blasted thing.  Again she cursed the man who invented
the medieval contraption.  Seeing that she wasn't going to be able to
do it alone with a cast still on one arm, Brooke walked over and
offered her help.</p>

<p>"May I?" Sam nodded and Brooke willed her hands not to shake.  All
too quickly for Brooke's satisfaction, the deed was done and she
stepped away.  "All set, Sammy.  Next time, I'll knock."</p>

<p>"Like I said, you've seen them now so what's the point in false
modesty?" Sam asked nonchalantly as she pulled a shirt on over her
head.  Brooke stared at her surprised at the girl's calm demeanor.
If someone had just walked in on her half dressed she probably would
have freaked.  But then, Sam was acting kind of left of center
lately.  If Sam were still taking her meds she'd blame it on that but
she wasn't and that left Brooke with no other options. &lt;Probably the
only chance I'll get to see her like that anyway.  Should enjoy it
while I can&gt; Brooke told herself&gt; Sam smoothed down her hair and
pointed to the vanity table.</p>

<p>"Your hairbrush is where you left it this morning, over there,"
Brooke followed Sam's hand and saw her brush on the vanity.  She
picked it up and ran it through her hair as Sam watched. &lt;Well, it
wasn't a rainbow flag but it'll do.  Probably the only way I'll get
to show Brooke my assets, so that was fun&gt; Sam laughed to herself.
Brooke put down the brush and turned back to Sam.</p>

<p>"Ready to go charge up a storm?" Brooke asked.  Sam smirked.</p>

<p>"Lead the way."</p>
