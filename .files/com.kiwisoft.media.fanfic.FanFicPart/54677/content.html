<!-- This Time Around \ Part Two: Hello Heaven -->

<p>***Insert City Name***</p>
<p>Faith stopped her bike in front of a nice two-story house. She
checked the piece of paper where the G-man had written the address of
where she was to stay again. "Musta wrote it wrong." Faith mumbled
to herself, then she noticed a little old lady walking out of the
house and towards her. "Great two minutes here and I'm gonna get the
cops called on me."</p>
<p>"Faith?" The little old lady asked.</p>
<p>"Yup. and you are?" </p>
<p>"You can call me Nadia, welcome." The little old lady, Nadia,
motioned to the large house and Faith couldn't help but stare, this
place was as big as the whole motel she stayed at when in Sunnydale,
and a hell of a lot nicer too! Nadia grabbed Faith's had and drug
the stunned girl into the house. "Now it's just going to be me and
you here dear. So I'll expect you to help out around the house, you
know clean up after yourself." Nadia raddled on as she walked Faith
through the living room. "This is the family room, over there is the
kitchen, on the other side of that is the laundry room. Um that
there is my room, and up those stairs is your room and the guest
rooms. Your room has a bathroom in it so it shouldn't be hard to
find. Oh sorry dear, I hope you don't mind me not showing up myself,
bad knees, that's why I have a room on the first floor."</p>
<p>"No.ah no prob, I'll find it." Faith disentangled herself from
Nadia, `strong little ol' lady.' She walked up the stairs and
started looking in rooms. Only one of them had a bathroom in it, and
from the looks, it was the master bedroom. "Cool." Faith threw her
saddlebag down and flopped down on the bed. "Well this ain't so
bad." Faith reached her arms back to stretch when they encountered
paper. She leaned up and grabbed the envelope addressed to her.
Opening it she found that it was her new records, class schedule, and
other things she'd need for school. Looking at the post-it note she
frowned. "I ain't even got there yet and I got a meeting with the
principal." Frowning she shoved the papers back in the envelope, it
was dinnertime, and she was hungry.</p>
<p>The next morning Faith was up at least an hour before she actually
had to be. And she found herself doing something she never thought
she'd do; she was standing in front of a closet (which had been
magically filled) and wondering what to wear. Whoever when shopping
for her did a good job. There were lots of black and other dark
colors. Lots of leather. And what wasn't leather, looked like it'd
be skintight. There were tank tops of various lengths and colors.
She had never had this many cloths before, and that was added up
through out her entire life! Finally she decided on black leather
pants, white baby tee, and her motorcycle boots, not to mention her
ever present leather jacket.</p>
<p>Faith bounded down the stairs, careful to be quiet in case Nadia was
still asleep, and found her way into the kitchen. Nadia was sitting
there, paper in her hands, cup of coffee on the table in front of
her. On the stove sat some bacon, eggs, toast, and hash browns. On
the counter a glass pitcher of both milk and orange juice sat. When
Nadia heard Faith she put the paper down.</p>
<p>"Morning deary. I heard up there taking a shower so I went ahead and
made some breakfast for you. First day of school and all, thought
you might get hungry. Oh and there is some money for your lunch
sitting on the little table by the door, next to your house keys."
Faith could only stare in astonishment. She had never been treated
this well in her life, and she couldn't figure out why this lady
would want to take a piece of.well why she would want to take her in.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She grabbed a glass of juice and her plate and sat down at
the table. It didn't take her long to eat and when she was finished
she rinsed off her plate and put it in the dishwasher. She still had
plenty of time before she had to meet the principal, so she decided
she would ride around on her bike, see if she could find anything
interesting around the area. "Bye Nadia." Faith said, and
impulsively kissed the old woman on the cheek, then rushed out the
door.</p>
<p>Nadia stared at the retreating figure and then smiled, "yes deary I
think you're going to do just fine now." And then she went back to
her paper and coffee.</p>
