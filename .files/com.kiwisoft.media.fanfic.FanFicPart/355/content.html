<!-- In the Bedroom \ Part One -->

<p>"Let's consider this idea of manifest destiny.  But, let's think of
it in terms of today.  Can anybody think of how it relates to what's
going on today?" Mr. Asspole asked surveying the class.  "Jessie, any
thoughts?"</p>

<p>"I guess," Jessie began glancing up, `that I should have been paying
attention' she continued to herself.  "That," she continued shifting
uncomfortably, her gaze raising to from her notebook and wandering
around, searching for something, anything, that could give her a clue
as to what was going on.  "Maybe," she continued her gaze shifting to
the doorway where she spotted a familiar face peaking in.  "Actually,
I don't really have any thoughts," she finished lamely, trying not to
smile thereby showing her inordinate delight at seeing Katie standing
in the doorway grinning at her. </p>

<p>"That's alright," Mr. Asspole, responded in a soothing voice, "I know
you're going through a situation," he continued causing Jessie to
squirm awkwardly in her seat.  Just what she needed, for the entire
class to become aware of her and her situation once more.  She could
as well have been wearing a button on her lapel that said `My Mother
almost died, Pity me!'  "But remember homework is mandatory," Asspole
continued obliviously.  "Re-read chapter 8 as well as 9 and expect a
quiz," he finished up as the bell rang loudly behind.  To bad it
hadn't saved her.</p>

<p>"That was sooo uncalled for," Katie said shooting Mr. Asspole a look
that could have curdled milk.  From her expression it was clear that
she believed he should be punished in some horrible way, like having
his head repeatedly dunked in an unflushed toilet, for his social
faux paus.  It kinda lifted Jessie's spirits.  She too had thought
that it was uncalled for.</p>

<p>"No, I'm an idiot," was how she responded however, as she flung her
bag over her shoulder resignedly.  </p>

<p>"You don't need this right now," Katie said authoritatively.  "Come
on," she continued reaching out and grasping Jessie's hand to lead
her out of the classroom.  "Let's ditch," she continued in a
conspirital tone bumping their shoulders together.</p>

<p>"Let's take the rest of the day off," she continued letting go of
Jessie's hand as they entered the crowded hallway.  "What's the
difference," she continued looking seriously at Jessie.  "In the long
run," she finished her eyes studying the other girl as she mulled
over what was being proposed.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said with a small smile that quickly grew.  "Let's
just get out of here."</p>
