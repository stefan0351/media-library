<!-- Il Loro: Il Bruciando Ballo, Il Ballo Burrascoso \ Act IV:  Fate -->

<p><b>Scene 1: ...is fickle</b></p>

		<p>The senior staff was gathered around the conference table to discuss a recent encounter with a group of aliens.  They had barely made it through the last system intact and now Voyager was in dire need of repairs.  Unfortunately the replicators were offline and even if they were functioning they were short many of the ores and minerals needed for the replicators to make all of the parts they needed.  Additionally, the ship was limping along with only impulse engines.</p>

		<p>The Chief Engineer was just finishing up a dismal report and requesting that an away team be formed to find the supplies she needed to get the intrepid ship back underway.  The Captain questioned her Astrometrics officer about the locations of nearby planets only to find disappointment.  They had barely finished the scans of the nebula that they were currently near when they entered the last system.  Then they were attacked and sensors were one of the first systems to get hit hard.  Long-range sensors were still down.  Seven knew little about the upcoming planets.</p>

		<p>The former drone proposed that she could make some slight adjustments to the Delta Flyer's sensors and run scans from the other side of the nebula if she were part of the away team.  B'Elanna Torres glared at Seven's proposal of adjusting the Flyer, but knew she shouldn't argue.  If she wanted her supplies she'd have to live with Seven's tampering.  She had been extra leery of dealing with the woman since her ex had confronted her a couple of days ago.  She had not exactly been polite to Seven throughout the meeting nor in the times before that when the Captain had sent Seven to assist in the engine room.</p>

		<p>The Captain was thoughtful over the Borg's proposal, not wanting an away team to go out into the unknown without support from the ship.  However she recognized the necessity of the trip.  She approved the idea, but ordered Tuvok to lead the mission and added two names from Geometrics.   They would be there to assist in the ore retrievals if it was decided they could safely travel to an extraction site straight from the edge of the nebula.</p>

		<p>The meeting ended and most everyone left immediately to carry out his or her newest orders.  The exceptions were Seven and B'Elanna, both held back by the Captain.  The Captain addressed the tall blonde first, going over what she thought were important points about acceptable retrieval sites, and asking Seven privately what she might have remembered eideticly about the nebula's properties.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna tried to be patient as she listened to the two women softly speaking, but it was hard not to want to get away from Seven.  Tom had angered her... and confused her.  She did not appreciate that this woman was at the center of all her frustration, her confusions and often consuming her thoughts.  That infuriating woman was driving her crazy, because she wanted to despise everything about the former drone, but could not.  Now Tom had forced her to look at Seven from a couple of different directions than she'd previously allowed herself to see.  It hit hard to know she had reduced Seven to tears.  It erased her ability to fool herself, to go back to thinking of Seven as unfeeling.</p>

		<p>She had begun thinking that again very seriously after their last dance.  It had been passionate, romantic and Tom was right when he said that she had allowed the woman to kiss her.  Yet, when the crew began clapping it was like Seven had become a drone again and ditched her like she had never seen her.  B'Elanna had been angry.  When she allowed herself to finally admit it, she knew what caused the anger was her pain.  She hurt because she felt rejected and discarded.  She felt like Seven had led her on; given her gifts and attentions, made her feel like someone special, then had deserted her after using her.</p>

		<p>Suddenly, the Captain spoke softly from beside her, and B'Elanna realized that she had done it again.  She had become lost in thought, staring unseeingly out the windows, thinking about Seven.  The Captain was patiently asking B'Elanna what was on her mind.  B'Elanna tried to deflect the issue by saying it was all about her repairs.  Captain Janeway stared at her momentarily then shook her head.</p>

		<p>"I don't think this has anything to do with our ship B'Elanna.  I don't know for sure what has you so upset, but I do know two things," Janeway said.  "First I know we had been close enough to share things before, but I respect that right now you need time.  Yet, you should know that I will be here for you when you are ready to share with me again."</p>

		<p>Janeway turned away from her young friend and seemed to stare at the same stars that B'Elanna had been staring at herself a moment earlier.  B'Elanna relaxed marginally at not having to face this respected woman and feel as if she were hiding something important.</p>

		<p>"I also know that you need to get your act together about Seven.  I have been hearing things...  from your own crew and those around you... things that are not really like you.  And they all seem to focus on Seven.  I know you've had problems with her in the past, I've dressed you both down... but she's doing nothing wrong.  You on the other hand are acting like a sullen child.  Get it under control... before I have to make this official B'Elanna.  I don't want to see you acting rude and petulant like you just did in our meeting ever again.  Are we clear?"</p>

		<p>The Captain didn't turn to face the hybrid, so B'Elanna tried to see if she could see Janeway's expression in the reflection, only to discover Kathryn hadn't been looking at the stars after all.  The older woman had been staring at her face all along, and now they locked eyes briefly in the reflection.  B'Elanna felt like a chastised child and looked away.</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," B'Elanna said subdued.</p>

		<p>"Dismissed," the Captain said and B'Elanna turned to leave right away.  She didn't look back, so she did not see her friend and leader sigh and shake her head.  B'Elanna didn't see Kathryn rest her face in one hand.  She didn't see Janeway's sad eyes.</p>

		<p>Only the woman in the reflection saw that.</p>

		<p><b>Scene 2: Time stands still for no woman</b></p>

		<p>Two days after the away team had left found B'Elanna alone again with Kathryn Janeway.  They were in the Captain's ready room and Janeway sat patiently watching the engineer pace and rant.  She was being terribly patient with her young friend, knowing that it was better to let her vent than for the hybrid to bottle it and see it explode on someone else.</p>

		<p>"Kahless! I mean really Kathryn!  Why? Why does she have to do these things?"  The young woman asked her rhetorical questions loudly.  Kathryn was quite sure many on the bridge could hear parts of her exclamations.  The Klingon-Human hybrid took another round around the bottom floor of the ready room.</p>

		<p>"You know, she has driven me crazy from the very day you decided to rescue her.  That time she came into my engine room to help and nearly dialed back to the Borg really was the beginning of her keeping me pissed.  Her cool, superior attitude?  I always thought she believed she was better than us," the young woman complained as she paced.  Her Captain just listened.</p>

		<p>"And that whole bet thing... she just had to go and prove she could do it didn't she?  I really was shocked by it, but not nearly as shocked as I was when she told me the payback."  B'Elanna growled slightly and turned and stared at Kathryn.  "Did you know she chose my dress for the Ball?  She replicated it, and the jewelry and the shoes...  the whole nine yards.  I looked it up.  The jewelry would have cost her 50 days rations!"</p>

		<p>Apparently this did surprise Janeway, because both eyebrows shot up and she canted her head looking at the young woman.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but that's not even all of it is it?  She had already replicated and given me a beautiful outfit on the first day she told me what she wanted.  She didn't need to give me another... she just did.  She provided everything I needed to learn that dance: the inspiration, the holo-program, the holodeck time and time itself.  She made me feel special you know?  That morning finding nicely wrapped gifts in my quarters, knowing she was... I don't know... it was like she cared."  B'Elanna sat down next to her friend.  In a much softer voice she declared, "I liked it.  And that night, she had me.  She made me feel like the center of her universe, for just that dance at least.  But when she left me it hurt."</p>

		<p>"She hurt too B'Elanna," Janeway spoke at last.  "I spent most of that night with her... she did not understand any of it.  I am sure she was originally nice to you because she has always liked you, even respected you despite your arguments."  B'Elanna looked at the Captain with surprise, but the older woman just nodded and continued.  "She is a special person... a genuinely caring and loving person B'Elanna... you just never gave yourself a chance to notice before then. That night though...  she told me she had believed those in the crew who said she was incapable of love.  So you can imagine how suddenly finding herself in love with you was very confusing."</p>

		<p>"In love?"  B'Elanna asked in a pained voice.</p>

		<p>"Yes.  She believes she is in love with you... I'm not sure why she still is after the way you've acted since then though," Kathryn quipped and grinned at the hybrid, trying to lift the pall that had been in the room.  However B'Elanna just began to silently tear up again.</p>

		<p>"How can you say she's still in love with me?  The dumb Borg had to go and put herself in the line of danger again and now she's probably dead.  I'll never get a chance to tell her... how I feel.  I'll never get a chance to fix it all."  B'Elanna wrapped her arms around herself as if to stave off a chill, even as she shuddered.  Tears began to trace down her face in earnest.  Janeway wrapped her arms around the engineer.</p>

		<p>"We'll find her."  The captain stated decisively.  "You'll see... she's a tough and resourceful woman B'Elanna.  Chakotay reported that they have been having success digging through the cave in.  He estimates it should only take another 3 hours to get to where Tuvok and Seven were when she warned him and pushed him out of the way.  She'll back with us soon."</p>

		<p>"Kahless I hope so," B'Elanna said.  "I need her back... I love her."</p>

		<p><b>Finale:  Looking ahead</b></p>

		<p>B'Elanna Torres stood out on the veranda of her room, which overlooked the alien city.  The crew had been afforded a long leave on this beautiful planet found only two systems away from the nebula they stayed in for quite some time.  The planet's inhabitants were friendly, looked a lot like Vulcans although shorter in stature, and gregarious.  The tropical setting of the leave location gave B'Elanna a spectacular view from her height many stories up, as well as an excuse to wear a dress not worn for many months.</p>

		<p>The dress had become special to her, and when she wore it she felt closer to Seven.  It was the dress the Borg had given her months ago in the holodeck before their first dance together.  Putting it on tonight she could not stop herself from crying as she looked in the mirror and remembered her foolish anger... her wasted time.  Now her tears had long dried upon her cheeks.  She stood in a suddenly chill wind, her skirt catching in the breeze, gooseflesh all over her body.  Her eyes seemed to be locked only upon the twin moons in the distance.  Her stance as she crossed her arms over the front of the low cleavage was tense.</p>

		<p>In fact she could not relax, could not let herself go.  It was too soon.  She waited for the right time.  She would wait forever if she had to.</p>

		<p>She was so deep in thought, so lost in painful memories, that she did not hear an entry into her room.  She did not feel someone walk silently to stand behind her.  Only when the petals of a white rose came to barely tickle the tip of her nose, the scent assaulting her, did she realize she wasn't alone.</p>

		<p>The smile that suddenly adorned her face was radiant.  She leaned back into the body behind her even as she captured the thin boned hand holding the flower.  She felt an arm gently surround her stomach to hold her tight as she inhaled more deeply of the flower held before her.  Then there were those soft lips laying an even softer kiss on her cheek.  She closed her eyes, an automatic contented hum escaping her and her head fell back into the neck behind her.</p>

		<p>"I missed you," B'Elanna spoke softly.</p>

		<p>"I always miss you when you are not near," Seven replied.  It was an almost rote response, except both women felt the words they spoke to the very marrow of their bones.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna did not move to turn around and Seven was perfectly content to hold her lover for as long as she wanted to be held.  Nothing pleased Seven more than to be with B'Elanna whenever she could, holding her, looking at her, talking, sharing or just being together in silence; it did not matter what they did or where, just that they were together.</p>

		<p>"Earlier tonight, I was thinking about the first time we danced," B'Elanna said many minutes later.  She felt Seven's smile upon her temple.  "You stirred something within me even that night, you know?"</p>

		<p>"I did not," the blonde answered.  "You appeared angry.  I did not understand then how to see through your anger to what could lie beneath.  I only knew I enjoyed your passion."</p>

		<p>The smaller woman laughed softly.  "You are my passion now Seven."  B'Elanna took the rose from the hand she had held until that moment.  Then she turned slowly within Seven's arms.  Seven was wearing the flat Starfleet issue boots she had taken to wearing while off duty, so they were nearly at eye level again since B'Elanna was in her heels.  "You are my heart and my love too."</p>

		<p>Seven's pale cheeks darkened slightly in a blush, a reaction that B'Elanna always thought was adorable.  It amazed her how wrong she had always been about Seven.  The young woman didn't think of herself as superior; in fact she thought herself inferior in many ways.  B'Elanna also found she enjoyed making Seven feel special even as she reveled in the blonde's breathtaking attentions.  The couple hadn't had nearly the time they would've like together since Seven was found alive.  B'Elanna had surprised her that day by kissing her on the transporter pad in front of everyone present barely an instant after she had materialized.  However, the time they did spend together was filled with laughter, smiles, love and revelations.</p>

		<p>Some things had yet to be discovered, but they had five days together, in a private room, far away from the rest of the Voyager crew.  Neither wanted to miss a minute of their leave that could be spent in each other's company.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna felt her heart beat a little harder when Seven smiled a little wider.  It broke through her initial designs on letting Seven set the entire pace of the evening.  What could it hurt to ask for two little things she asked herself.  With that thought, she leaned forward and kissed the tempting lips for as long as her own lungs would allow.  It seemed nanoprobes made it farther than three lungs.</p>

		<p>After they had finished their long kiss and the many small kisses that followed, B'Elanna found her voice to ask for her one other immediate desire.</p>

		<p>"Will you dance with me?" was all she said.</p>

		<p>"Always," came the immediate answer.</p>

		<p>Soft, slow music was brought up with simple commands.  Despite their abilities the two women simply danced together slowly.  They moved in a very small radius on the veranda observed only by two moons.  The dance wasn't filled with the burning passions of the Captain's Ball; instead the dance let them feel the gentle bonds of true love.</p>
