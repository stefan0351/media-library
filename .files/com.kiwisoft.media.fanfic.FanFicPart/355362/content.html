<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ And The Bottom Drops Out -->

<p>Finals came and went with little fanfare or fear from either
Brooke or Sam. They were both well prepared and passed with flying colors. Now
all they had left was graduation week itself. An entire week of rehearsals,
goofing off, half days and Brooke trying desperately to write her speech.
Despite several offers from Sam to help, Brooke was steadfast in her
determination to write it herself. </p>
<p>She was sitting on the couch with a pad and a pencil trying to
write the damn thing while Mac sat happily in her playpen playing with one of
the toys she had gotten for her birthday. It was one of those infrequent quiet
days where you just lay around and wait for life to happen. (I should let Sammy
help me with this) Brooke told herself. (No, I can do it myself) She wanted to
do it herself because it was her last chance to leave her mark at Kennedy as
something other than the `gay popular girl'. She just had no idea what to say. </p>
<p>The doorbell rang and she was halfway off the couch to answer
it when Sam bounded down the stairs at a frightening pace. Brooke was almost
afraid Sam was going to go through the door bodily. </p>
<p>"I got it!" she announced. Sam reached the door and yanked it
open. Her stomach dropped to her feet for a minute and then anger flooded her
system. Brooke, who was all ready up and almost to the door anyway, came up
behind her. </p>
<p>"Who is it, Sammy?" she stood behind Sam and looked out the
door. The face that greeted her sent her into shock. </p>
<p>"Mmo...Mom?" she stuttered as her mother Kelly stood in the
door. "What are you doing here?" Kelly smiled. </p>
<p>"You didn't really think I'd miss my baby's graduation, did
you?" she asked. Brooke and Sam kept staring at her in various degrees of shock.
"Can I come in or do I have to stand out here all day?" </p>
<p>"Stand out there all day," Sam muttered as Brooke elbowed her
and they both stepped aside to let Kelly in. Kelly missed Sam's little comment.
Kelly looked around the room. </p>
<p>"Wow, the house has changed," she said. She spied Mac in her
playpen. "And who is this?" she asked sweetly as she walked over. She leaned
over the top of the playpen and Mac eyed her warily. Sam recognized the look and
silently encouraged her little sister. </p>
<p>(Come on, Mac, do it) she cheered. Mac's face scrunched up and
turned red as she started to cry. (All right Mac! Way to go!) Sam picked her
little sister up and away from Kelly. </p>
<p>"That's MacKenzie, our little sister," Brooke explained as
Jane and Mike entered the room. Both stopped in their tracks. </p>
<p>"Kelly?" Mike said surprised. Jane shot a look at all three of
her daughters. </p>
<p>"I came to see Brooke graduate," Kelly explained. Sam handed
Mac to her mother. </p>
<p>"I'm going to put Mac down for her nap," Jane said as she
exited the room. Sam walked back over to Brooke. </p>
<p>"Well, the awkward quota in this house just rose 300 percent,"
she whispered. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"So where are you staying?" Mike asked feigning interest.
Kelly rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"The Hiatt, like you care. Honestly Mike, why do we play this
game? I came to see my daughter so just go back to doing what you were doing,"
she said. Mike looked at Brooke who nodded. </p>
<p>"I'm in the kitchen if you need me, girls," he said to Brooke
and Sam as he left, glad to get away from his ex. Kelly turned back to her
daughter. </p>
<p>"Brooke, have you put on weight?" Brooke paled and shrunk into
herself while Sam's anger flared. </p>
<p>"Hey! Back off, bitch! There's nothing wrong with the way she
looks," Sam snapped. Kelly fixed her with a bored stare. </p>
<p>"I wasn't talking to you, Sam. Run along, I want to spend time
with my daughter." Sam's hackles were now firmly up. </p>
<p>"How convienent for you. Where have you been since she was
nine, huh?" Sam challenged. Brooke meanwhile was looking down at herself and
wondering if she looked that bad. Sam noticed and crushed the urge to kill Kelly
on the spot. </p>
<p>"Brooke," she said firmly to get the young blonde's attention.
Brooke looked at her with an expression mixed with fear and self-loathing that
broke Sam's heart. It amazed Sam that Kelly could be in the house less than ten
minutes and undo months, years worth of progress in helping Brooke overcome her
self-image problems. It also pissed her off more. </p>
<p>"Brooke," she repeated softer. "Princess, you look great.
Don't let her get to you. We've been over this. You're healthy and that's all
that matters, OK?" Brooke nodded and Sam turned to Kelly. </p>
<p>"As for you, what gives you the right to march in here
whenever the whim hits you and pull the rug out from underneath her like that?"
Sam demanded to know. Kelly glared at her. </p>
<p>"I'm her mother," she responded. </p>
<p>"When it suits you," Sam shot back. "I got news for you, she's
got a mother now that's there for her 24/7 and doesn't care what size she is and
loves her unconditionally. Can you say the same?" </p>
<p>"She should watch her weight. No man is going to want a fat,
bloated, has-been for a wife," Kelly countered. Sam smiled wickedly at how she
could defeat that argument but thought it best to wait until all parties were
calmer before dropping that bombshell. </p>
<p>"You'd know, huh?" Sam shot back. </p>
<p>"Mom, Sam, please stop," Brooke finally spoke up. "Look, this
isn't the place to be having this conversation." </p>
<p>"How about dinner, Brooke? My treat, just the two of us?"
Kelly suggested. </p>
<p>"Three. Sam goes too. We have some things to discuss with
you," Brooke said. Kelly shook her head. </p>
<p>"You don't need her there to talk to me, Brooke. Just you and
me." Brooke turned to Sam. </p>
<p>"Give us a second, Mom?" Kelly nodded and walked a few feet
away. </p>
<p>"It's up to you, Princess. I don't like it cuz she winds you
up so," Sam whispered. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I know but she won't let you go and she has a right to know
about us," Brooke told her. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Are you sure you want to tell her alone? I mean we told
everyone else together, except my Mom but she sprung that on me so that doesn't
count. We're in this together, love." Brooke spared her a small smile.
</p>
<p>"No choice this time, Sammy. Besides, what's the worst she can
do, really? Leave me and never talk to me again?" Sam squeezed Brooke's hand
before letting go and watching Brooke walk back over to her mother. </p>
<p>"That's what I'm afraid of, love," Sam sighed. She had a bad
feeling about this. </p>
