<!-- About a Girl \ Part 14 -->

<p><i><u>School – Monday</u></i></p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie called back smiling before turning her attention back to Grace with a somewhat uncertain expression. That was like the tenth person that she didn't know to greet her since she'd walked into the school building that morning. "I didn't start spitting gold or something did I?" Jessie asked stepping closer to Grace unconsciously. She didn't like this newfound visibility. It was jarring.</p>

<p>"In a way," Grace replied watching Jessie with a touch of amusement. "It's what you get for dating the most popular girl in school, instant celebrity and a new and lower class of poser, user friends. Congratulations."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't it be more like the cause a major social backspace?" Jessie asked not quite able to wrap her mind around how on the planet earth dating a girl could increase her popularity. It boggled the mind. "Shouldn't I be spray painting over slurs on my locker or something?" she asked, having truly anticipated a less than enthusiastic response upon returning to school after the dance. She didn't think that there was going to be like major violence or something, but she'd expected snide comments and sideways look at least.</p>

<p>"Inevitably, there's going to be some asshole that's going to think it's funny or something to bother you about, but I wouldn't expect much of that. Everybody's already thought that Katie was gay for like a year and nobody gave or is likely to give a shit. It's 2002 and queer or not someone like Katie …"</p>

<p>"What do you mean someone like Katie?" Jessie asked not quite sure what to make of Grace's statement or tone.</p>

<p>"Someone beautiful and personable, with just the right touch of mystery to make everyone go `oooh ahhhh'," Grace replied shortly. "Adoration is like in her DNA or something, when the doctor let her mother hold her for the first time he probably told her to start preparing for house party's, and when she got dumped in the room with the other babies she got like invited to a kegger like as soon as the nurse left," she continued. "Plus, it's a universally known fact that dating cool makes you cool. So as long as the golden girl, is your girl you better get used to the celebrity," Grace finished wishing that she had to adjust to problems like Jessie's. Oh, my significant other is breathtakingly beautiful and popular, and would crawl fifty miles over broken glass to sweat in my shadow, and everybody loves me and I just won a million dollars and discovered a cure for cancer. Woe is me, Grace thought to herself sullenly.</p>

<p>"But I haven't changed," Jessie pointed out in what could be argued to be a whine if one cared to argue about such things.</p>

<p>"But you have. Over the weekend you became like ninety percent more interesting. Because as far as everyone's concerned if Katie sees something in you, then there must be something worth seeing," Grace replied running out of steam to pep talk Jessie into liking popularity. "You're in. Enjoy it," she finished trying not to sound as bitter as she was starting to fell. "Later," and with that she took off down the hall to find her class, or a big hole, whichever she came across first.</p>

<hr>

<p> "How could you do this to me?" Tad whispered harshly flinging Katie's hand off of his shoulder and backing them up underneath the stairs away from prying eyes. "Everyone knows," he continued whispering. "I'm a fucking joke!"</p>

<p>"I didn't DO anything," Katie responded defensively, taken back by his response. "You had your chance, she didn't like you," she went on in a like tone. "You had every opportunity. Hell, I helped set you up!"</p>

<p>Tad sighed in acknowledgement of the fact that Katie really couldn't be blamed for Jessie not wanting to date him, after all it wasn't like he was going to consider major surgery for her or anything. But that didn't mean she was off the hook. "You could have told me at least," he said running an agitated hand through his hair. "I still thought I had a chance…I… Russell's been harassing me ever since the dance. I mean do you have any idea what it's like for the entire school to know some chick stole your girlfriend?" he said getting worked up again.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Katie exclaimed. "I didn't steal anything. She's not a fucking VCR!"</p>

<p>"You don't even get it do you?" Tad asked pissed off by Katie's attempt at comedy. "I'm on the football team!"</p>

<p>"What?" Katie whispered back at him totally confused. "The football team? Oh, hi left field nice to see you too. What are you talking about?" she continued peevishly.</p>

<p>"I'm …" Tad started agitatedly, he's eyes scanning the hallways. "I…" he said, stopping abruptly, his eyes focused behind Katie.</p>

<p>"You're what?" Katie asked turning around to see what had distracted him and spotting Jessie moving towards them.</p>

<p>"I'm going," he muttered shooting her one last contemptible look before pushing past both girls.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie said softly, resting her hand on Katie's waist as she studied her girlfriends clouded features. "Is everything alright?" she asked leaning into her slightly.</p>

<p>Katie sighed as she felt Jessie's body against her, the tension flowing out of her body like the tide as Jessie's voice reached her ears. "Yeah," she breathed out a moment later, wondering at the effect Jessie was able to have on her. "But only because I have like the best girlfriend in the history of the universe."</p>

<p>"That's a lot of history," Jessie commented pulling back slightly to observe Katie's face. </p>

<p>"I'm aware of that," Katie responded with a small smile making no attempt to alter her statement any.</p>

<p>"You sure everything's okay?" Jessie asked, still clearly able to see worry etched over Katie's features.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I mean, Tad's just pissed off because I didn't tell him about us, and his friends are harassing him cause you ditched him for a chick," Katie replied sounding rather lost. She really hadn't anticipated him getting upset, though thinking about she realized she probably should have. She was just too busy thinking about Jessie all the time to realize that he had still been thinking about her too.</p>

<p>"I didn't ditch him for you," Jessie responded truthfully. "I ditched him cause he's a lunk," she continued causing Katie to laugh momentarily before quieting down again.</p>

<p>"He doesn't see it that way," Katie replied. "What is with the people at this school?" she asked tiredly. "Everyone like seriously over-estimates the power of my charms."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," Jessie replied thinking that she liked Katie's charms over-estimated or not. "You did get the girl," she continued with a smile. "Don't worry, I'm sure he'll be over it by lunch."</p>

<p>"You think?" Katie asked hopefully. While it was true that Tad was nothing to write home about, he was *her* nothing to write home about – in a manner of speaking. They'd been friends since Power Rangers was cool, and she'd kind of gotten used to having him around, annoying as he may be.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded though she seriously had no idea. Tad didn't strike her as the sort with a long enough attention span to hold a grudge for too long, but the truth was there was no way she could know how long he'd be angry. The only thing she knew was that there was no sense worrying about it cause there was nothing they could do to change it.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie repeated more for her own benefit than any other reason. She knew what Jessie was trying to do, and she was willing to accept it. "So," she continued deciding to move on to greener pastures. "How about I officially walk you to class?"</p>

<p>"I officially like that idea," Jessie agreed smiling as Katie reached down for her hand.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey," Katie said stopping Jill Mason as they passed her in the hallway. "Don't forget about `Sebastian's' tonight."</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah your worship, I know," Jill replied grinning as her gaze shifted over to Jessie and then down to their loosely joined hands. "Hey," she said addressing Jessie who merely nodded not quite sure what etiquette demanded out of her. She would make a horrible trophy wife, she was certain of that now. "Anyway," Jill continued her attention back on Katie, "you should make sure to remind Phil. He lost his pad of post-its and now he's completely hopeless."</p>

<p>"Alright, I'll track him down," Katie responded frowning slightly at the mention of Phil and his stupid post-it notes. He was such a jackass.</p>

<p>"Sweet. Later," Jill called glancing at Jessie once more before whacking Katie on the back playfully and taking off down the hall, Jessie's eyes following her as she went.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Katie asked noticing Jessie staring off down the hall after Jill.</p>

<p>"She talked to me," Jessie replied as if it was comparable to finding a bar of solid gold up her ass.</p>

<p>"So?" Katie responded. "I talk to you all the time, and you only occasionally look at me like that," she continued receiving a slap on the arm for her trouble.</p>

<p>"I mean, I've been getting that all day. Strange people that I've never even seen before, are like waving and saying hi to me and stuff," Jessie responded. "Grace says it's because I'm your girlfriend."</p>

<p>"Is that what Grace says?" Katie asked not quite sure were Jessie was going with this.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie replied with a small frown. "Which is weird, people being all nice because of something so periphery."</p>

<p>"First you stare at someone else's ass and now I'm periphery," Katie grumbled teasingly. "I'm beginning to wonder if this official class walking thing was such a good idea."</p>

<p>"Will focus for like five seconds?" Jessie asked smiling to show she was only kidding. "I'm waxing philosophy here."</p>

<p>"Sorry," Katie replied properly whipped, wondering if the garbage needed to be taken out. "How do you feel about it?"</p>

<p>"Weird," Jessie replied smiling a bit.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I caught that," Katie responded rolling her eyes.</p>

<p>"How do you do it?" Jessie asked. "How do you deal with not knowing whether someone's talking to you because they really like you, or if they're just doing it to get close to who you are or who you're with?"</p>

<p>"You just get used to it," Katie replied seriously. "Most times I don't even think the people that are doing it know whether they like you or just the image of you. Which makes it a real bitch for anyone else to figure out. After a while you just kind of learn to sense the really fake ones … if you're lucky, and everyone else gets the surface material."</p>

<p>"That sucks," Jessie replied softly a moment later, wondering how Katie managed to deal with it day in and out.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Katie admitted remembering how alone she had felt, keeping everything that she was feeling to herself because she didn't know which of her `friends' actually cared enough for her to tell them anything. "And sometimes not so much," she continued smiling down at Jessie adoringly, also remembering what a revelation it had been to be really able to talk to Jessie, to find someone who was interested in more than the surface material.</p>

<p>"Stop it," Jessie said laughing as Katie continued to stare at her, her expression now humorously doting.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Katie asked batting her eyes and sighing dreamily.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" Jessie exclaimed still smiling as they continued through the halls.</p>
