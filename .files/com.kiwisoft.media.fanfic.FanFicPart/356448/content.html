<p>&quot;You did what?&quot; Giles asked angrily when
Willow told him what she had done to the Vatican's library files. &quot;Why would you do
that? How could you take that kind of chance? What if they trace your virus back here? I
just wish you had put a little more thought into it or at least informed me before you
acted so rashly. Honestly Willow I don't know what to think, this is completely out of
character for you. &quot; </p>

<p>Willow sat calmly and let the over protective
ex-watcher rant until he was finished and glaring at her waiting for her answer. She knew
he was really mad, she could see the vein throbbing on his right temple and that was
usually reserved for the Slayer. </p>

<p>&quot;Calm down Giles before you hurt
yourself.&quot; she said quietly yet firmly </p>

<p>&lt;She's treating me like a petulant child.&gt;
Giles thought. </p>

<p>He sat down behind the desk with a huff. She
smiled at him sweetly. </p>

<p>&quot;That's much better.&quot; Willow said
patiently I don't know what your problem is. It's not like I'm some rank amateur at this,
I took precautions. First I went through so many different connections Ma Bell and all her
little baby Bells couldn't trace me. Second the virus destroys all evidence of my
incursion along with the files including the hard drive, they'll never be able to retrieve
that information again, and third I did it for all those women the Church had murdered
just because they had different beliefs and had the good fortune to find someone they
loved, and stayed with them no matter what.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then they bragged about it Giles read it,
that's all those records are is some old bigot of a priest bragging about how many
blameless women he personally had murdered. Hell, their lucky I didn't bring the whole
place down on them. Besides you know how the Vatican works they'd probably come after
Buffy and me if they thought they'd get away with it.&quot; </p>

<p>Faced with her logic and determination Giles had
no alternative but to calm himself and read the information she'd brought him. &quot;This
is ghastly&quot; he muttered as he read the account. &quot;How could they possibly justify
this?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You see my point.&quot; Willow said softly
&quot;Those bastards had dozens of innocent women slaughtered in the name of
religious purity and the Church not only condoned it, the priests responsible were given
rewards and promotions for their 'good works'. I know what I did was a little rash but, I
just couldn't let those men be remembered by history as heroes of the
faith, so I've done my best to see that history
doesn't remember them at all.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alright Willow, while I can't condone your
methods,&quot; Giles said holding up his hand to stop the protest forming on her lips
&quot;I do have to agree it was at least a logical response. My only comment is that this
is not the last time you will run into this kind of thing and the next time you feel the
urge to take action please consult me before you do anything and we might come up with a
more appropriate response. One that wont deprive the world of valuable historical
records.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay I can live with that.&quot; Willow
agreed &quot;Now let's get to work on the section of the book that's mentioned here, and
see what's next on my schedule so I can clear my calendar,&quot; </p>

<p>She was joking but as she read it suddenly became
unfunny. Giles finished the section shortly after she did and took off his glasses and
began rubbing the bridge of his nose. </p>

<p>&quot;Well that was certainly interesting.&quot;
he said a little sarcastically, &quot;I will be looking forward to seeing how you handle
this.&quot; </p>

<p>&lt;Now he shows a sense of humor&gt; Willow
thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks a lot,&quot; Willow shot back.
&quot;You mean no words of wisdom from the all mighty, all knowing watcher?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, I am afraid you are on your own for this
one.&quot; Giles answered with a slight smile &quot;This is one Slayer/Willow situation
that falls far outside my duties and way beyond my experience.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh great, nothing quite so useless as a
useless watcher.&quot; Willow grumbled &quot;Can I at least count on your
cooperation?&quot; </p>

<p>Giles nodded his head trying to keep from laughing
at Willow's newest dilemma. </p>

<p>&quot;Good&quot; Willow said thoughtfully then she
knew just the right person to talk to. &quot;Alright Mr. laugh at the confused witch guy,
then not a word to anyone and I mean anyone.&quot; </p>

<p>He agreed quickly and satisfied Willow hurried out
to find Buffy's mother. Once Willow tracked down Joyce Summers and explained everything to
her she suggested that they get Willow's mother on board for this situation. </p>

<p>Willow's mother wasn't as comfortable with her
daughter's alternative lifestyle as her husband and Joyce, but this problem was something
she could understand, in theory at least. She jumped in with both feet and was a veritable
fountain of information. Arrangements were coming along nicely when Willow decided it was
time to 'talk' to Buffy. </p>

<p>At Willow's insistence Buffy took a night off from
patrol and wearing her best dress went to meet Willow at their favorite Italian
restaurant. The owner of the restaurant had taken a liking to the couple and as soon as he
saw Buffy come through the front door he hurried over and gave her a major bear type hug
nearly crushing the breath out of her. </p>

<p>&quot;Please Mr. Lipari, can't breath,&quot; Buffy
gasped. </p>

<p>&quot;Your little Willow is waiting for you.&quot;
the man said setting her down and releasing her &quot;If you'll just follow me I'll take you to her.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sure thing Mr. Lipari.&quot; She said
mystified and noticing the huge grin plastered on his face. &quot;Say, just between you
and me, any idea what's going on?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh no Buffy.&quot; he answered &quot;I've
been sworn to absolute secrecy. Willow would skin me alive if I told you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay we wouldn't want that.&quot; she
chuckled &quot;Who'd make my canolli if something happened to you. I couldn't' eat anyone
elses after tasting yours.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You are too kind&quot; he said truly
flattered then the grin reappeared, &quot;But I'm still not telling you. Now come along
Ms. Willow is waiting.&quot; </p>

<p>The friendly man led her through the main dinning
area but instead of going to their favorite table he led her to the door of one of the
private dinning rooms. When she entered it took her breath away, the only illumination in
the room were dozens of flickering candles and standing next to the only table was Willow.
She was a vision in an emerald green silk dress it was obvious that she'd been to the
salon, looking at her Buffy could feel that familiar ache of longing deep in her soul.
 </p>

<p>Willow motioned to Buffy to come to the table and
held her chair while she sat down. Unable to resist Willow leaned down and lightly brushed
her lips against the soft skin of Buffy's neck. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh god Wills.&quot; Buffy moaned trying to
urge her to continue but Willow straightened up and went to her own chair directly across
from Buffy. </p>

<p>There was a single white rose next to Buffy's
plate, she held it to her nose and slowly inhaled it's fragrance. She looked over the top
of the rose and smiled at the way Willow was watching her every move. </p>

<p>Mr Lipari himself served their meal that they ate
in complete silence, their eyes speaking volumes across the table in a language only they
understood. Finally as they were finishing their desert (Mr Lipari's famous canolli,
Buffy's favorite) Buffy's curiosity got the better of her. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright my little witchy girl,&quot; Buffy
began,as she ran the tip of one fingernail gently over the back of Willow's hand,
&quot;What's going on here?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why Slayer what ever do you mean?&quot;
Willow said with mock innocence, &quot;I'm just out to dinner with my bestest gal.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right, &quot; Buffy said only semi playfully
&quot;I'll tell you what, I'll go on home now and when your ready to let me in on the
secret that's where I'll be.&quot; She started to rise but Willow grabbed her
wrist to stop her, Buffy looked into those
pleading eyes and sat back down knowing she was lost. </p>

<p>&quot;Please don't leave Buffy.&quot; Willow's
voice was strained &quot;I promise you'll understand real soon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Buffy said softly
&quot;It's just I'm not a patient person, life's too short, especially a Slayer's
life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't&quot; Willow said closing her eyes
trying to stop the tears. &quot;Please don't say that.&quot; </p>

<p>Seeing the hurt she'd inadvertently caused Willow,
Buffy went around the table and cradled the weeping girl's head. </p>

<p>&lt;Geez Summers way to go&gt; Buffy thought,
mentally kicking herself &lt;Some day I just gotta learn to shut up.&gt; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't cry Wills &quot; Buffy said in a
frightened almost little girl voice. &quot;It was a mean thing to say, I'm sorry I didn't
say it to hurt you.&quot; </p>

<p>Willow looked into Buffy's clear blue eyes and
felt herself drawn into their depths. </p>

<p>&quot;It's alright honey, really&quot; Willow
reassured her. &quot;It's just that I don't want to think about that tonight. Tonight is
for better, more optimistic things. Now please go back and sit down.&quot; </p>

<p>Buffy did as Willow requested and Willow reached
over and took Buffy's hand. They gazed into each other's eyes and for a moment time ceased
to exist. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; when Willow said her name like
that it almost sounded like she was praying &quot;I guess it's time to tell you why I
wanted to meet you here tonight.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well to be honest, I'm getting a little
curious.&quot; Buffy answered her I mean aside from the good food and the pleasant company
not to mention a welcome night off, I figured there had to be some thing going on.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It's just that well I found something that
day after Litha, while you were asleep and it's got me thinking.&quot; Willow started
holding on to Buffy's hand tightly &quot;I know we've just got done telling everyone about
us and after all we've been through with that and I know that logic and common sense would
dictate tat we 'lay low' and not do any thing to call attention to ourselves at least
until tings settle down.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay that's kinda the way I figured.&quot;
Buffy interrupted but Willow held up her hand to stop her. </p>

<p>&quot;Like I was saying, I've come across some
disturbing information that has made me rethink that idea.&quot; Willow continued
&quot;What I've found has made me think about how short life can be and how easy it is for
some outside force to make that life even shorter. </p>

<p>My greatest fear has always been to leave this
life with too many regrets. Like everyone I have many things that I regret that it's too
late to do anything about but I've decided that we...you and I..we...our relationship is
not going to be one of those regrets.&quot; </p>

<p>&lt;Oh god she's leaving me!&gt; Buffy thought,
she felt an icy dagger of fear pierce her heart. &lt;I've done something wrong, I've been
to clingy.&gt; </p>

<p>Willow saw the stricken look cross Buffy's face
and hurried to reassure her. &quot;I don't mean I want out.&quot; Willow clarified quickly
&quot;It's just that what I want to do doesn't make any sense. I mean we're in a pretty
good place right now and most people would be happy to sit back and relax, but we're not
most people.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ain't it the truth.&quot; Buffy snorted
despite the seriousness of the moment. </p>

<p>&quot;I guess the best way to explain this is to
tell you what I've found.&quot; Willow told Buffy everything she'd found about the Sisters
of the Soul and how they were persecuted and murdered by minions of the church until there
were only two left and the legend that said the last two were rescued by the gods and
taken still living to paradise to become gods themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;I think you can figure out who those last
two sisters were.&quot; Willow added </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah I can.&quot; Buffy said tears flowing
unchecked from her eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;Like I said I've found out a lot.&quot;
Willow said kissing Buffy's hand &quot;One of the things I've learned is that when two
sisters are united they go through certain ceremonies. One is like a wedding with
family and friends so that everyone can celebrate the joining of souls. The second is a
ritual of joining with only their closest friends attending. Ever since I've found out
about I've been running around trying to set this up and I've gotten to the point where I
can't go any farther without you.&quot; </p>

<p>Willow stopped and looked deep into Buffy's eyes.
Then she got up, came around the table and dropped to her knees beside Buffy and looked up
at the angelic face she loved so much. &quot;I guess the best way to say what I'm trying
to say is,&quot; Willow said her voice trembling with pent up emotion &quot;I love you
Buffy Summers, will you marry me?&quot; </p>

<p>Buffy was speechless, she'd never figured on this.
Her mind was completely out of control her thoughts swirling and jumbled, she couldn't put
a single coherent thought together. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh..I...ah..you.. we...&quot; No matter how
hard she tried Buffy couldn't say a complete sentence. She knew she loved Willow more than
life itself and she knew that she would do whatever it took to make the red haired girl
with the bright green eyes happy. She also knew that nothing in this world would make her
happier than to tell the world that she loved Willow Rosenberg. </p>

<p>So her answer was short easy and to the
point. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes yes yes yes !&quot; was Buffy's final
word on the subject. </p>
