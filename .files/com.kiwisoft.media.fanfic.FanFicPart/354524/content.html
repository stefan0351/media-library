<!-- Realms \ Part 7 -->

<p>Both Women jumped up from there seats when they heard Giles plea to
run, Faith quickly rushed towards the door way to see what he was
yelling about. She rounded the corner and spotted Ethan Rayne and
another man standing in the door way, Giles was paying no attention
whatsoever to Ethan as he focused all of his attention on the other
man. </p>

<p>Giles looked at the warlock, his body was visibly trembling from
fear, "Ciarán, why have you come here, what do you want?"</p>

<p>Ciarán motioned his hand through the air and a unseen force tossed
Giles aside. The warlock then walked into the house with Ethan in
tow, His fiery red eyes locked on the ex-watcher, "Ethan tells me you
went soft Rupert, what a shame, you had such potential."</p>

<p>Ciarán walked over to Giles and leaned down putting both his hands
on Giles shoulders, "Tell me are you still the little researcher I
used to know."</p>

<p>Faith couldn't believe what was happening but she was determined to
put a stop to it. She screamed at the mysterious man who had somehow
just attacked Giles, "Get away from him!"</p>

<p>Giles shot the Brunette slayer, who was slowly advancing towards
them, a look of pure panic, "Faith no!"</p>

<p>Ciarán turned away from Giles and glared at Faith. "You're way out of
your league little girl," replied the warlock as he threw his hand
out towards Faith, sending her flying backwards through the hallway.</p>

<p>After Faith hit the ground she looked over into the living room at
Joyce, "Run, get B."</p>

<p>It took Joyce a moment to comprehend what was happening but as soon
as she did the she made a rapid break for the back door, only to find
that it somehow had been sealed. She slowly walked back into the
living room and saw that Giles and Faith were sitting on the couch,
with the two men standing behind them.</p>

<p>"Come join us," replied Ciarán.</p>

<p>Immediately after falling asleep in one another's arms Buffy and
Willow found themselves in the dream world. They were in a rather
large room lit solely by thousands of candles, their where small
murals covering three walls that depicted the history of the slayers,
with a rather large painting of the two of them that took up an
entire wall. Buffy sat down in a rather large oversized chair and
pulled Willow onto her lap, "I think it`s a pretty good likeness, how
about you?"</p>

<p>"I agree, but why is it here, and where is here."</p>

<p>"Slayer, please allow me to explain," Replied Fey as she walked into
the room via a hidden door, "This is Alexandria's castle, and you are
in the hall of the Slayers."</p>

<p>"OK, now we no the where, so how about the why."</p>

<p>"To give you a sense of what you are and what you are becoming now
that your full potential has been released. Look around you, each on
of the pictures represents a slayer, each one of them is a
predecessor to you."</p>

<p>Fey walked over to the large portrait of Buffy and Willow and pointed
at it, "Do you know why unlike the other portraits you are not
depicted alone or why the picture of the two of you is larger than
the others."</p>

<p>"Tara told us she is to become the ultimate slayer, is that why,"
questioned Willow.</p>

<p>"Well done young mage, but that is only partially correct. Yes, Tara
did tell you that your beloved is to be the ultimate slayer, however
you must know that as soon as the two of you found one another The
Powers that Be transformed her into the ultimate slayer. Also know
that the reason you are in the picture is not because of her being
this great warrior but because the two of you are soul mates."</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy, before turning her attention back to
Fey, "If that is true why are all the others slayers shown alone?"</p>

<p>Fey`s immortal eyes filled with sadness, she walked over to the two
girls and placed a hand on each of them. Fey looked directly into
Willows eyes, "She is the only slayer ever to find her soul mate."
A tear rolled down Fey's cheek as she turned her attention to
Buffy, "Cherish the love you have with the young mage," Fey then made
a sweeping motion around the room as if pointing out every single
picture on the walls, "It is something none of your sisters before
you where able to find."</p>

<p>Fey's words struck the slayer in her very core, she slowly looked
around the room carefully studying each picture on the wall as tears
of sorrow for the other slayers filled her eyes. Buffy tightly
wrapped her arms around Willow, "I will," replied Buffy, "I will."</p>

<p>Suddenly Fey's eyes grew wide with alarm, "The watcher and the others
are in grave danger you must return and get Tara then go to them."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Giles could feel the waves of pain shoot through his body as Ciarán
once again magically attacked him. "I'm not going ask again Rupert,
tell me what you know of the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"Never," cried out Giles in agony.</p>

<p>Ciarán gazed into the ex-watchers eyes for a moment before turning to
take a quick glance at the two women who where had been restrained in
chairs. "Maybe I have been going about this wrong. It would appear
that their is nothing I can do to you to make you give me the
knowledge I need."</p>

<p>Ciarán walked over and stood between Joyce and Faith, He pulled out
a large silver dagger from beneath his cloak and sinisterly smiled at
Giles, "So which one shall it be. Your slayer or your lover."</p>

<p>"Please, I beg of you....don't."</p>

<p>"Then tell me what I want to know or one of them is about to die."</p>

<p>Giles gazed over at Joyce and Faith before hanging his head in shame
over what he was about to do, "where do you wish me to start,"
inquired a broken Giles as Ciarán laughed knowing he had one this
battle.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy looked at the door to Giles house which was ajar, she knew
there was no way he would leave his house open like that, especially
at night. </p>

<p>"Willow you and Tara stay here, I'm going in."</p>

<p>Buffy silently crept into Giles house and immediately knew that
something was wrong, the living room was littered with all of his
books and furniture was tossed all over the place. She then stopped
dead in her tracts, "Willow, I need your help."</p>

<p>Willow rushed into the house with Tara right behind her, Faith was
lying on the floor, with Buffy kneeling next to her over her. "Oh,
my god, is she..."</p>

<p>"No, but she is hurt pretty bad."</p>

<p>Faith`s voice was so weak Buffy could barely hear it, "B forget about
me, I'll survive. You got to find them."</p>

<p>"Find who?"</p>

<p>"Giles and your mom, he took them."</p>

<p>Faith's words struck Buffy square in the heart, not only had someone
trashed her watchers house and hurt her friend and fellow slayer, but
they had taken Giles and her Mom, "Faith, who took them."</p>

<p>"Ciarán and Ethan."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and faced Willow, her eyes where filled with rage
towards this Ciarán, "Willow you stay here with Faith and Tara, I'm
going to go get Giles and my mom back."</p>

<p>Tara carefully approached the slayer, "I d-don't think that....m-
might be the best thing to do. Fey told me that..... Ciarán is a
very p-powerful warlock."</p>

<p>Willow comfortingly embraced Buffy, "Sweetheart she's right, look
what he did here, we need to come up with a plan and possibly get
some help."</p>

<p>Buffy considered what her love had said and knew the red head was
right, "OK, but whatever we do we have to do it fast, I have a really
bad feeling about all of this."</p>

<p>Willow thought for a moment and then it dawned on her, "Tara, I need
you to try and contact Fey. Let her know what happened and see if
she can aid us. Buffy take Faith to her room so she can get some
rest and heal up, I'm going to call LA and try and reach Angel, he
might just be able to help."</p>
