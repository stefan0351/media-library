<!-- Human Layers \ Part Eight -->

<p>Spike heard his men enter the warehouse, trying to be slow and quiet. There
		were only four of them now; he was losing people fast. In his wheelchair, he sat
		facing a wall, biting back the tears and turning weak emotion into rage.
		Tomorrow was Valentine's Day; he would be reminded of Druscilla often, and the
		pain would come back just when he thought he could function without her. He
		reminisced, remembering how they used to seek out happy couples that were in the
		middle of romantic, midnight strolls. The hunt was a Valentine's Day tradition.</p>
		<p>The sight of people in love pleased Druscilla; she had a childlike
		fascination with the silent communication they shared, while being blind to the
		world around them. The eyes revealed so much to her, so many stories, and they
		were always easy prey. Though she was sickened by the goodness out of which the
		love was born, the blood was sweeter. It wasn't like her and her Spike. Their
		love was dark, painfully erotic...it was eternal. At least, her lover and childe
		had thought that.</p>

		<p>She would make the victims' deaths special, as was fitting for tradition. The
		neck didn't get punctured, oh no. The area of the chest - the flesh that
		shielded the heart - she drained the life from there, sinking her teeth in and
		moaning all the while. She insisted that she had sucked the love right from
		their hearts, and that she could feel the sensations wash over her. The purity
		of the feelings made her cry out, but soon her demon blood warped the emotions,
		and she made that love hers.</p>
		<p>When she and Spike retired for the night, they would pleasure each other
		almost until noon, because she was so high from the energy.</p>
		<p>Druscilla was dead, those nights lost, and he could look forward to several
		lifetimes of loneliness. If the Slayer and his Grandsire didn't put a stake in
		him first, of course. Angel. That was where he placed the blame. He'd sent out
		vampires night after night to kill him, and fewer and fewer came back each time.
		The ones who escaped said Angel was ruthless, brutal; they weren't prepared.
		Then Spike dusted them, angry and frustrated. He'd take the matter into his own,
		usually capable hands, but was unable to do so at the moment. That was the
		Slayer's doing.</p>
		<p>She came up with the plan, Angel executed it. They'd die for Dru; that was a
		promise.</p>
		<p>"How successful were we tonight?" He asked in an even tone, still
		staring at the wall.</p>
		<p>"The guy got Tony."</p>
		<p>"Is that right?" Spike wheeled around. "There's only three of
		you. Where's Lenny?"</p>

		<p>"Lenny took off, man. Said he quit."</p>
		<p>"That was kinda rude, don't you think? I would've expected at least two
		weeks notice." He pushed himself onto the speaker's foot. The vampire
		winced, and Spike crooked his finger. "What's your name, mate?"</p>
		<p>"R-rick."</p>
		<p>"Oh, yeah, I remember. The 'Power-walker Kill.' You do nice work."</p>
		<p>"T-thanks." Rick tried to maintain his composure, as Spike yanked
		him by his shirt.</p>
		<p>"Which is why I'm not gonna hold this slip up against you. Angel didn't
		make it two centuries by being an idiot. He was also no fun, but the point is,
		he's not an easy target. And rather than waste more resources on the poof, I'm
		giving you a new job. You can't destroy the instrument, you destroy the brains
		behind it."</p>

		<p>He paused, letting his blood boil.</p>
		<p>"The Slayer. Put the bleedin' bitch in the ground!" Spike growled.
		"This is an opportunity very few vampires get...*Rick*. The publicity alone
		should motivate you, cause if you don't, you better hope she does you before I
		hear about it. The sooner the better. Do we have an understanding?"</p>
		<p>"S-sure. You b-bet."</p>
		<p>The bleached vampire rolled off the foot, and Angel/Angelus left the scene
		from his vantage point outside. Buffy was his, and he had to decide what to do
		about Spike. The demon didn't want its coming out party spoiled.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>The following morning the bell rang, signaling the end of American Literature
		for Buffy, Willow, and Xander. The romantic holiday was upon the three friends,
		two of which had dates, while the other one didn't. And being a sensitive guy,
		Xander was slightly depressed about that. Willow and Oz, Buffy and Cordelia...Xander
		and The Air. He sighed, having faith that a solution to his dilemma would reveal
		itself.</p>
		<p>As he got up from his seat like the rest of the class, the teacher, Ms.
		Beakman, spoke.</p>

		<p>"Papers on my desk. Anybody tries to leave without giving me a paper is
		looking at a failing grade."</p>
		<p>Assignment in hand and bag on his shoulder, he walked down the aisle behind
		his friends. "Ha, ha, ha. This time I'm ready for you. No 'F' for Xander
		today. No, this baby's my ticket to a sweet D-minus."</p>
		<p>Willow saw Amy, and stopped beside her. "Hey, Amy."</p>
		<p>"Hey." The girl responded, adjusting the strap on her backpack.
		"Are you guys going to the Valentine's Day dance at the Bronze? I think
		it's gonna be a lot of fun."</p>
		<p>The redhead turned to the slayer with a huge smile.</p>
		<p>"Go ahead, you know you wanna say it." Buffy permitted, amused.</p>

		<p>When she faced Amy again, she was grinning.</p>
		<p>"My boyfriend's in the band!"</p>
		<p>Her childhood friend laughed. "Cool."</p>
		<p>Willow looked back at Buffy.</p>
		<p>"I think you've now told everybody."</p>
		<p>"Only in this hemisphere." The hacker pulled on her backpack</p>
		<p>"What about you?" Amy asked Buffy.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Valentine's Day is just a cheap gimmick to sell cards and
		chocolate." She came off sounding nonchalant, then walked up to the
		teacher's desk with the girls, and handed her paper in.</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Beakman said.</p>
		<p>Buffy headed out, followed soon by Willow, who gave her paper and received a
		'thank you' as well.</p>
		<p>Xander was still behind Amy, watching as she and the teacher seemingly got
		into a staring contest. A few seconds passed, and then the older woman made a
		gesture like she was accepting a paper. She smiled, gave Amy an automatic 'thank
		you' just like she had for everyone else, and waited on him. Amy left as if
		nothing happened. He stood in shock for a moment, and then relinquished his
		paper, in a hurry to catch up with Buffy and Willow.</p>
		<p>They were currently making their way downstairs with Amy, and spotted
		Cordelia standing at the bottom.</p>
		<p>"She poo poo's it, but she's spoiling her rotten." Willow whispered
		to Amy, attempting to glance at the brunette discreetly, who was quickly joined
		by a happy Buffy.</p>

		<p>Amy smiled at the pair when they stepped onto the first floor, and then went
		into the lounge.</p>
		<p>"I never said it was a *bad* gimmick, I just said it was cheap."
		Buffy defended herself, smirking at her friend's, 'How did you hear that?' look.</p>
		<p>"And you better not be." Cordelia interjected, putting an arm
		around her girlfriend's neck.</p>
		<p>Buffy just smiled sweetly. There were plans, all right. She looked away as
		Xander arrived, having finally reached them through the mass. The mass that
		continued to give the occasional glare her and Cordelia's way, but that was
		about it.</p>
		<p>"Did you guys see that?" He questioned, pointing at Amy.</p>
		<p>"See what?" Buffy asked back.</p>

		<p>"In class. I think Amy just worked some magick on Ms. Beakman."</p>
		<p>"You mean like witchcraft?"</p>
		<p>"You know, her mom's a witch." Willow reminded the group.</p>
		<p>"And an amateur psycho. Amy's the last person that should be messing
		with that stuff."</p>
		<p>"What'd you do to her mom, anyway?" Cordelia wondered.</p>
		<p>"Heck if I know." Buffy shrugged. "She zapped herself, then
		presto, no more Evil Mom."</p>

		<p>"You won. End of story, if you ask me." The redhead contributed.</p>
		<p>"Willow's right. You have other, more important things to focus on
		today." The cheerleader told the slayer. "Me, for instance."</p>
		<p>"Maybe I should go talk to her." Xander said, an idea springing to
		mind.</p>
		<p>The happiness was too much for him to handle. He ran up to Amy without
		another word and pulled her aside, away from the crowd in the lounge.</p>
		<p>"What are you doing?" She asked, somewhat mad.</p>

		<p>"Amy. Long time no see."</p>
		<p>"We just saw each other two minutes ago." Had he gone insane?</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well, that's...true." He took a quick look around. "And
		you're a</p>
		<p>witch."</p>
		<p>She smiled nervously. "No, I'm not. That-that was my mom,
		remember?"</p>
		<p>"I'm thinking it runs in the family. I saw you working that mojo on Ms.
		Beakman." He started to look behind himself. "Maybe I should go tell
		somebody about -"</p>

		<p>"That's not even..." She glared. "That is so mean!"</p>
		<p>Xander returned the favor. "Blackmail is such an ugly word."</p>
		<p>"I didn't say blackmail."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, but I'm about to blackmail you, so I thought I'd bring it
		up."</p>
		<p>"What do you want?"</p>
		<p>She crossed her arms, defeated, and not hating him enough to turn him into
		something.</p>
		<p>"What do I want?" He rubbed his hands together. "Of all the
		questions, you had to pick that one, huh? Heh. Sorry, wasn't a good choice, Amy.
		In fact, it was very, very wrong. Because now you're under my control. So much
		power, so many options...let's see. What to choose, what to choose..." His
		confident expression faded, becoming suddenly shy. "Go out with me?"</p>

		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>At the Bronze, Dingoes Ate My Baby was playing on stage. Willow was sitting
		behind the people on the dance floor, at a table with Xander and Amy. She didn't
		understand why the two were there together, but was too engrossed in her
		guitarist boyfriend to care. She moved her head to the beat of the music, a big
		smile plastered on her face.</p>
		<p>"Oz has his cool hair today." She announced. "I think I'm a
		groupie!"</p>
		<p>Xander looked at his date. "You can go mingle, ya know. You've suffered
		enough, and I thank you for it."</p>
		<p>"I didn't have to come at all, Xander. I could've easily removed your
		tongue or given you never-ending athlete's foot." Amy told him, truthfully.</p>
		<p>"I've gotta do more prep work before I threaten." He gulped.</p>

		<p>"I'm glad you didn't."</p>
		<p>"Uh...why?"</p>
		<p>"Am I still here?" She smiled, and he slowly smiled back.</p>
		<p>A short distance away, Buffy and Cordelia were standing behind a couch,
		drinking cups of soda. They had been dancing during the last song, but decided
		to sit the current one out. The brunette rolled her eyes at Willow's enthusiasm,
		but was very interested in what she was seeing develop between Xander and Amy.
		It made her wonder where he got the guts to face possible rejection, because she
		always thought if he asked a girl out his head would explode. She kind of wanted
		to see if Amy would do it, too.</p>
		<p>"They've got potential, huh?" Buffy asked, observing the same thing
		her girlfriend had been.</p>
		<p>"I've seen worse." Cordelia admitted. "If he keeps her away
		from cauldrons and black cats, they have a shot." She grinned. "Oh
		wait. That was *just* her mother."</p>

		<p>The slayer shook her head, the sarcastic tone not lost on her, and gave the
		cheerleader a light thwap on the arm. She then checked her watch and saw the
		time, which caused her eyes to widen. They were on a schedule, and she had
		nearly forgotten. She snatched Cordelia's drink right from her hand, found a
		place for trash, and dumped both cups.</p>
		<p>Cordelia was left alone briefly, trying to figure out what was going on, when
		she saw Harmony enter the club with her entourage. In that instant, Buffy
		reappeared and began pulling her towards the doors. She almost tripped.</p>
		<p>"Hey! Girl wearing heels here! Someone should've stuck to Diet."</p>
		<p>"Sorry, but you'll thank me later."</p>
		<p>As they were going, the ditsy blonde glared, so the brunette made it a point
		to show her a certain finger. Harmony huffed, and hurriedly dragged everyone to
		the bathroom to complain. The sheep were unaware that they had just brushed past
		a vampire, who watched as another followed the couple outside, leaving from the
		back to alert others. He quickly and stealthily made an exit, trailing his
		competition.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>They were a block from her house when Buffy stopped walking. Every muscle in
		her body tensed; she'd felt like she was being tracked even in the Bronze, but
		ignored it, being too distracted by what non-supernatural things could go wrong
		with the evening. It figured that since she was finally in a relationship,
		something would want to interrupt the first important date on the couple
		calendar. She didn't have time to mess around with a newborn trying to make a
		name for himself, she really didn't.</p>
		<p>Cordelia knew what that look on Buffy's face was, and she also knew she
		should've brought her car. Walking might've been romantic, but driving equaled
		vampire protection. Her girlfriend wordlessly motioned her to stay close, and
		then the slayer leapt into action, whirling around to deliver a kick to the
		vampire that had come up behind them. Her foot hit stomach, and the vampire
		hunched over. As it straightened, Buffy grimaced.</p>
		<p>"Angel?"</p>

		<p>"Have you ever heard of 'hello'?" The brunette asked him.
		"It's a pretty well-known word. Learn it. Unless you like having your
		insides rearranged..."</p>
		<p>"Not really." Angel said, his arm in front of his stomach
		protectively.</p>
		<p>"Cause hey, if you do, that's your choice."</p>
		<p>"What're you doing here?" Buffy asked, warily.</p>
		<p>Something didn't feel right. Was his face...different? Harder or...and that
		didn't matter, because three vampires appeared out of the shadows, circling the
		trio. Buffy got into a fighting stance. It was a good thing she didn't decide to
		wear a dress, or there would've been a stake-carrying issue. Getting one out of
		the pocket of her pants, she stood back to back with Angel, with Cordelia next
		to her.</p>

		<p>"I followed them from Willy's to the Bronze. They've been watching
		you."</p>
		<p>"I need to get you in the house. We can make a break for it if Angel
		holds them off." She told her girlfriend, surveying the situation.
		"I'm not taking any chances. Once you're inside, I'll deal with this."</p>
		<p>"But -" Cordelia started.</p>
		<p>"No." She interrupted forcefully. "No one's gonna spoil
		tonight for me."</p>

		<p>From the second they'd been discovered by Buffy, Angel had been battling with
		his demon for control, and he wasn't going to take any chances, either. He had
		allowed it to feed on too many people already; fighting back was becoming
		increasingly more difficult, but it wasn't going to get her. Or Cordelia. He
		wouldn't let it. Using all he had, Angel pushed it down, ignoring the inner
		growl of protest.</p>
		<p>"She's right. Help me." He said, a touch of desperation in his
		voice. "Help me split them up, then run. I can handle it."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure?" The blonde questioned, concerned.</p>
		<p>"Wouldn't be the first time."</p>
		<p>With that, Buffy round-housed the one in front of her and Cordelia, while
		Angel took the one on the left. Seeing the hole, they booked it for the house,
		but not before she tossed him her stake. As the girls went off and distanced
		themselves from the scene, Angelus broke free, showing its anger through
		vampiric eyes.</p>
		<p>"You always get in my way." It snarled.</p>

		<p>"Get used it, you're stuck with me." Angel replied.</p>
		<p>"For now."</p>
		<p>The two fallen attackers were standing again, joining the third. It was him
		they wanted, anyway. William the Bloody was a damn cripple; his orders and
		threats didn't mean a damn thing. Watching Angel talk to himself caused a slight
		hesitation, but they were quickly doing their best to beat him down.
		Unfortunately for them however, demon and man had just decided, at least for the
		time being, to cooperate with one another.</p>
		<p>Even though a part of Angel wanted to die, he couldn't ignore his survival
		instinct. He knew that every time he gave into the demon, let it have its fun
		(in whatever form that took), a piece of him slipped away. But it was too strong
		an instinct, and with the two halves working together, no prey could survive.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>"Where'd Buffy and Cordelia go?" Amy wondered, still at the table
		with Xander.</p>
		<p>"Oh, she has this big, romantic dinner thing planned at her place. Cordy
		didn't know." He answered her. "I would've done something like that
		too, but..."</p>

		<p>This was kind of new.</p>
		<p>"Relax. There's always next year." She grinned, standing up.</p>
		<p>"And here comes the pressure."</p>
		<p>Next year? He'd be lucky if she could still stand him next week.</p>
		<p>"There isn't. Really." She assured him. "Dance?"</p>
		<p>"I'll give it the old college try." He cracked his knuckles, and
		then they walked out to the floor, where Willow and Oz were already dancing. The
		band was taking a break between sets; a DJ was picking the music. "And if
		there's toe crushing, don't worry; I've got the hospital bill covered. They
		accept Monopoly money, right?"</p>

		<p>After some awkwardness, they settled in nicely to the slow-paced song. His
		arms around Amy's neck, and hers around his waist, Xander found Willow in the
		crowd. The friends shared a smile. The redhead wasn't the only one who'd had a
		crush on him.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>In the Summers' home finally, Cordelia removed her shoes. They were no longer
		salvageable. Placing them by the door, she was now barefoot, and trailed Buffy
		into the living room. The slayer switched on a lamp, and then proceeded to look
		out the large window. The brunette had noticed that the Jeep wasn't in the
		driveway, and as she sat on the couch thinking about that, it raised suspicions.</p>
		<p>"Your mom go out?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, she met this guy, came into the gallery...they went
		somewhere..." Buffy answered, still distracted by the view outside the
		window.</p>
		<p>"So it *is* a guy? Not a robot with a human facelift?"</p>
		<p>"I had Willow check. Medical records, police record...he's got all the
		right organs and one speeding ticket. From when he was twenty, but I still made
		mom promise to drive." She paused. "Should I...?"</p>

		<p>Cordelia shook her head. "He wants to be macho? Let him. Besides, he was
		stalking you."</p>
		<p>"What?" Buffy turned to her with an alarmed expression.</p>
		<p>"When doesn't he stalk you? That's all he has to look forward to at
		night."</p>
		<p>The cheerleader received a mock glare. "It's just...I asked him about
		Theresa a couple weeks ago like you said, and -"</p>
		<p>"And his place looked like a tornado blew through it." Cordelia
		finished. "Yeah, you told me."</p>

		<p>"He didn't know anything about who got her, but he said the reason the
		apartment was a mess was cause Spike's guys were trying to get payback for
		Druscilla. Now they're after me, because they couldn't take Angel out."</p>
		<p>"Then it's a good thing you're here, and they're...someplace that's
		else, having their pale asses kicked. I know I'm happy about it."</p>
		<p>"But he shouldn't have to protect -"</p>
		<p>"Buffy? Shut up." The girlfriends kissed then, and that kissing
		transformed into the more advanced form, which involved tongue exploration. They
		finished off with some light hand roaming, as they broke contact to enjoy the
		oxygen that the air had to offer. "Making out on a couch." Cordelia
		managed to sigh. "How cliché can you get?"</p>
		<p>"You started it." The blonde wasn't ready to stop, either. She
		placed kisses down Cordelia's neck, and worked her way back up to the mouth. She
		felt a finger tap her on the back. "Hmm?" She mumbled.</p>

		<p>"Why's there a huge, white bear on the chair?"</p>
		<p>Buffy giggled, making her take a break and look. "Did somebody read a
		lot of Dr. Seuss as a kid?"</p>
		<p>"Green Eggs and Ham? Ick." The brunette made a face to go along
		with her word of disapproval. "Seriously. There's a bear holding a box
		of...are they chocolates?"</p>
		<p>"Valentines Day, chocolates...I've heard that they go together or
		something. Oh, that's cliché, isn't it?"</p>
		<p>"Clichés? Who cares about clichés? I don't even know what they
		are." Cordelia became excited.</p>
		<p>This resulted in a grin from the slayer. "And since I'm the only one who
		knows about the 'Cordelia Chase Secret Teddy Bear Collection'..."</p>

		<p>Cordelia pointed. "He's my bear?"</p>
		<p>"He needs a good home. With his own species. Pigs aren't his
		thing." Cordelia had gone over to the chair, and Buffy followed. "You
		two bond while I get dinner ready."</p>
		<p>"You're cooking?"</p>
		<p>"I'm gonna try to, yeah." She sat her chin on Cordelia's shoulder
		from behind. "If I fail miserably, you'll still love me for making the
		attempt, right?"</p>
		<p>"Don't be stupid; of course I will." The brunette smiled.

		"Just less."</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>Angelus had considered going back across town to the Bronze, maybe to kill
		one of the members of the unsuspecting group, but his desire for violence had
		been placated. Until the next sundown. The threesome attack squad was
		surprising, putting up quite a fight. They hadn't died easily; that only made
		impaling them all the more satisfying, but it was a good effort. It left him
		thirsty.</p>
		<p>He'd have to head in the direction of the club to get home, and he knew he
		could easily drain one of Buffy's friends, but the area around there was crowded
		now; love in the air, and probably the heat of several people screwing their
		brains out in the alleyways. No dark corner would be quiet enough, there was
		always the risk that one of them would see and escape to break the news.</p>
		<p>The kill had to be anonymous; he wanted to send the pieces to Buffy with a
		nice card. That's how she'd find out.</p>
		<p>Walking past the high school, he spotted a woman in the parking lot, cell
		phone in hand, heading towards her car. A teacher working late? Didn't they know
		better? She looked familiar, though. Like...oh yeah. Angelus smiled. He didn't
		just recognize her face; he recognized the scent of her blood. Deep lineage.
		This was someone special, someone perfect. Better than the children. This was
		what he'd dreamed for.</p>
		<p>She would be the way to reveal everything, but more importantly, she was
		revenge.</p>
