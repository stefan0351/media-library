<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 17 -->

<p>Brooke stopped and sighed. </p>
<p>She had been searching for what seemed like forever and still hadn't found Sam. She shook her head in embarrassment, mentally kicking herself for losing control on the dance floor. She didn't mean to take it that far, but Sam felt so good and she couldn't seem to stop. </p>
<p>She didn't want to stop.</p>
<p>She tried Sam's phone again. </p>
<p>Switched off.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>She ran an agitated hand through her hair and debated whether to just give up and go home. Maybe that's where Sam had gone.</p>
<p><i>And what will you say to her when you see her Brooke?</i></p>
<p>"Shut up, brain", she muttered to herself, ignoring the weird looks she got as some guy walked passed. She didn't want to think about that now. First things first.</p>
<p>Find Sam. </p>
<p>Then make something up.</p>
<p>Good plan.</p>
<p>She nodded to herself and continued walking, deciding to give the hall grounds one more search. Rounding a corner, she stopped suddenly when she saw a familiar figure pressed up against some guy she didn't recognise.</p>
<p><i>Great. Just great.</i></p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Sam? What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Are your parents home?"</p>
<p>"No, they're away for the weekend."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>She stepped inside and shoved him against the wall, kissing him hard.</p>
<p>"Upstairs. Now".</p>
<p>It took Alex only a moment before he followed her to his bedroom. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Nic?"</p>
<p>Nicole stopped and glanced at the blonde. Pushing the guy away she unsteadily walked over to where Brooke was standing.</p>
<p>"Brookie! There you are! I was looking for you", she said happily. </p>
<p>Brooke raised an eyebrow and crossed her arms. </p>
<p>"It doesn't look like you were trying very hard".</p>
<p>Nicole shrugged. "I got a little distracted", she replied smirking. </p>
<p>She turned to the boy.</p>
<p>"You can go now John". She said, waving him away. "Go on! Shoo!"</p>
<p>"My name's Andrew and we just got started!" he complained. </p>
<p>"Andrew, John, Delilah, I don't care." She glared at him. "Go away!"</p>
<p>She watched him for a moment then turned to face Brooke. </p>
<p>She grinned.</p>
<p>Brooke stared then rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Nic?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"How many drinks have you had tonight?"</p>
<p>"Only a couple".</p>
<p>Brooke stared.</p>
<p>"Or maybe ten", Nicole continued. "Which might explain why I can see three of you". </p>
<p>She started laughing. Brooke shook her head, then placed her arm around Nicole's waist, steadying her.  "Come on. There are some steps over there".</p>
<p>Brooke slowly guided them until they were both seated, waiting patiently as Nicole composed herself.</p>
<p>"Have you seen Sam by any chance?" Brooke asked, breaking the silence between them.</p>
<p>"Your girlfriend? Not since I saw you two practically fucking on the dance floor", Nicole answered with a leer. Brooke groaned as she put her head in her hands. </p>
<p>Nicole continued, clearly enjoying herself. </p>
<p>"Nice show by the way. Is it any wonder I needed some relief from Jack?"</p>
<p>"Andrew", Brooke absently. My god, how many people had seen them?</p>
<p>"Whatever. Let me be the first to congratulate you on your union", Nicole said, slapping her on the back.</p>
<p>Brooke looked up quickly. "Congratulate? You? Congratulate me getting together with Sam?" She paused. "Nic, how many have you had tonight? Really?"</p>
<p>Nicole laughed. "I've been doing a lot of thinking with the drinking". She stopped. "Hey, that rhymes!" She grinned then continued. "Anyway, I thought a lot about what you said to me yesterday and came to a decision."</p>
<p>She looked at Brooke, a serious expression on her face.  "I'm not one for mushy, lovey dovey declarations so I'm only going to say this once. I don't want to lose you either because I sort of....like you. You're the only person on this planet I actually care about and I need you in my life. You're my best friend and I want to keep it that way."</p>
<p>She stopped then smiled sheepishly. "Hell, you're my only friend!"</p>
<p>Brooke gaped at the blonde beside her, not believing what she was hearing. Once the shock wore off she grinned and threw her arms around her, surprising the hell out of Nicole.</p>
<p>"Hey! I don't swing that way", she joked, awkwardly patting Brooke on the back. She was not used to displays of affection from anyone, but she smiled, grateful that no one else was around to see how much she was enjoying this.</p>
<p>After all, Nicole Julian did have a reputation to maintain.</p>
<p>Brooke pulled back, still smiling. "You have no idea how glad I am to hear that Nic!" </p>
<p>"Just don't hug me again", Nicole replied gruffly, trying hard not to blush. </p>
<p>Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"So where is Mrs Spam McQueen?" Nicole asked, looking around.</p>
<p>"I have no idea." Brooke answered sadly.</p>
<p>"But what about...."</p>
<p>"We were just dancing, that's all", Brooke said cutting in. "She ran off once the song was over, and I've been looking for her everywhere."</p>
<p>Nicole stared, the disbelief obvious on her face.</p>
<p>"Just dancing? Hate to break it to you Brookie, but friends don't "just dance" like that. Bloody hell, I've seen porno movies that were less tame!"</p>
<p>Brooke groaned. "I don't know what got into me. She looked so sexy just standing there and I really wanted to dance with her and oh my god what the hell was I thinking?!" </p>
<p>Nicole watched as the blonde continued to berate herself. She had hoped that Brooke's feelings for Sam were just a passing infatuation but she knew better. If Spam was the one who made Brooke happy, then Nicole would try and be supportive. </p>
<p>That's what best friends did, right? </p>
<p>She sighed, shaking her head, not quite believing her generosity.</p>
<p><i>How many drinks have I had tonight? </i></p>
<p>"Spam wasn't exactly beating you off with a stick, Brooke." Nicole finally answered.</p>
<p>"What are you saying?" Brooke asked.</p>
<p>"I'm saying that maybe Sam feels the same way about you".</p>
<p>"So why did she leave?" Brooke countered, her heart racing at Nicole's words.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"I'm sorry Alex, I can't do this."</p>
<p>She stood up, quickly buttoning her shirt. </p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Alex asked, his voice devoid of emotion.</p>
<p>"I don't know." She replied quietly.</p>
<p>Alex stood up and walked over to Sam, gently turning her around.</p>
<p>"Stay the night. We don't have to do anything, we can just talk."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I can't. I need to go."</p>
<p>He stepped back, frustrated. "What the hell is going on Sam?"</p>
<p>"I'm just not ready", she answered, feeling guilty. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>He watched as Sam stood uncomfortably before him. </p>
<p>"That's not what I meant. I can wait for as long as you want me too. I love you Sam." </p>
<p>She looked away, unable to meet his gaze. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry Alex. I need to go."</p>
<p>Alex felt numb as he watched Sam go. He sank to the floor, his heart breaking.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam wiped away the tears as she continued walking, listening to the frantic messages Brooke had left on her phone. She contemplated going home but decided against it, not wanting to face the blonde so soon and explain why she had left the party.</p>
<p>And Alex. How many more times could she keep hurting him?</p>
<p>He told her that he loved her and she ran away like a coward. </p>
<p>It was the one thing Sam was good at. </p>
<p>Running away. </p>
<p>From Brooke. From him.</p>
<p>She didn't know what to say to his admission and Sam knew she couldn't lie. Not about that. She didn't love him the way he wanted her too. She loved Brooke, and the few minutes she had dancing in Brooke's arms were some of the happiest she ever had. </p>
<p>It nearly killed her too, realising that Brooke wouldn't love her the way Alex did.</p>
<p>So she ran to him. </p>
<p>"Love the one you're with".</p>
<p>And tried to love him.</p>
<p>Sam reached the park and walked to her favourite spot, sitting against the huge tree which overlooked the pond. She remembered as she and Alex exchanged passionate kisses, his hands moving all over her body. It wasn't until she imagined Brooke touching her that Sam began to feel anything.</p>
<p>She picked up a large rock and turned around, facing the tree. </p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>She smiled a little as she read the engraved words.</p>
<p><i>Sam loves Brooke.</i></p>
