<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ Before He Knocked (And After) -->

<p>I looked up from my folding at the knock on the door. Then I glanced over at Mister Crane. He was being an absolute bear today, which was part of the reason I urged him to go on that walk earlier and all of the reason I'd been so desperate to have lunch out. He sat on his chair, Eddie in his lap, both of them staring at the tv. Neither twitched a muscle.</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Ahem. 'Daphne, would you mind getting that? I'd greatly appreciate it.' 'Oh, no, not at all Mister Crane. I'd be delighted.' 'Oh, thank you Daphne. What would I ever do without you? We all appreciate you so much around here.'" I shook my head when he still didn't move and went to the door. I was surprised at who it was. After all, he hadn't been around very much recently. When he was here, it always seemed to be with Mel. "Well, hello again, Doctor Crane."</p>

		<p>He smiled and buried his hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat self-consciously. "Daphne." He looked up at his father. "Hi Dad." Mister Crane still didn't move except to mutter, "Son." What a git. Doctor Crane looked back at me. "I was hoping to talk to you, Daphne."</p>

		<p>I looked at him curiously. "Don't you have appointments this afternoon?"</p>

		<p>He looked down at his feet. "Err-- no. I've rearranged my schedule for today a bit."</p>

		<p>Oh, dear. What's this about? He doesn't generally flip his schedule about just to see me. Unless it's finally about -- Ever since Christmas, I'd been terrified and excited both every time he and I were alone together. "Of course, Doctor Crane. Why don't you come in? I'm just folding the laundry."</p>

		<p>He looked at his father pointedly, and then back at me. "Actually, I was hoping that we could perhaps go to the park. Take a walk --"</p>

		<p>Well, regardless of whether the mongrel had been paying attention before, he was listening now. Before Doctor Crane could say another word, Eddie was sitting at his feet, leash in his mouth. I tried to smile past my worry of what our little chat would be about. "Eddie seems to think that that's a fine idea. Would you like to leave now?" He nodded, and I glanced back at his father as I hooked Eddie. "I'm leaving. You need anything before I go, you lazy old sod?"</p>

		<p>His gaze didn't leave the tv. "Another Ballantine."</p>

		<p>"Well this time you can bloody well get it yourself. I won't be around forever, you know. In three weeks, I'll be a married woman." With that, I stepped out into the hallway.</p>
