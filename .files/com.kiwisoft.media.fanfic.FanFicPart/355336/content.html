<!-- High School Hell \ Turnaround Is Fair Play -->

<p>Brooke found Sam asleep on the couch a week later looking more at peace than she had in a long while. She was walking again more strongly with only the help of a cane and her sessions with Jenn were progressing well. She hadn't made any astounding breakthroughs but they were making small steps and little pieces of the old Sam were peaking through every now and then. At least she was speaking more and not pushing Brooke away as much. </p>
<p>Unable to resist the temptation, Brooke leaned over and pressed her lips to Sam's. To her surprise and utter relief, she felt Sam respond to the kiss. Sam reached up and pulled Brooke down onto the couch with her. </p>
<p>"Hey beautiful," Sam greeted her. Brooke looked at her in surprise and joy. </p>
<p>"Hey yourself. I didn't mean to wake you," she said. Sam arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"It's OK. Wake me like that anytime," she joked a little more of the old Sam McPherson spark returning to her eyes for which Brooke was thankful. </p>
<p>"Whatcha doing today, Sammy?" Brooke asked while she twirled a few strands of Sam's dark hair around her fingers. </p>
<p>"Nothing much, just moping," she answered. Brooke frowned at her. </p>
<p>"Moping is not a good hobby," she pointed out. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"No, but it passed the time until you got home from Glamazon practice," she said with a grin. "I missed you." Brooke looked at her strangely.</p>
<p>"Sam, not that I mind, but what's with the attitude change?" Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I miss you," Sam repeated softly. "I'm tired of pushing you away. I miss you, Princess." Brooke nodded her understanding and smiled.</p>
<p>"I miss you too, Sammy. So much," she hugged Sam tightly.</p>
<p>"I don't want to die, Brooke. But I'm afraid to live," Sam whispered. Brooke shuttered at the admission. There was the breakthrough they'd been looking for. </p>
<p>"Why Sammy?" </p>
<p>"Because of the pain. Everytime I turn around there's something new and horrible coming at me like a speeding freight train," she said as tears streamed down her face. Brooke brushed away the falling moisture with her thumbs. "I can't take it anymore." </p>
<p>"You don't have to, Sammy. That's what I've been trying to tell you. You insist on shouldering everything alone and won't accept anyone's help. Let me help you, Sam. I love you and want to help. You're not alone," she said gently. Sam leaned her head against her. </p>
<p>"I know. I realize that now," she whispered softly. "And I want your help, Princess. Please?" </p>
<p>"You don't even has to ask, Sam. I am always here for you." Sam let out a long sigh of relief. </p>
<p>"Thank you," she murmured. Content with each other for the moment, both girls fell asleep on the couch where their parents found them a few hours later. </p>

<p>Sam sighed as she stared at the blinking cursor on her laptop. The damn thing was mocking her, she swore. She was supposed to write an article on the new school budget but she could barely manage to write a title at the moment. She had no interest whatsoever in writing right now. Brooke was out with Nicole and their parents were out at a business dinner while Mac was at a babysitters leaving Sam home alone. She hated it because it left her with too much time to think. </p>
<p>(I think my brain has finally turned to mush) she lamented. Getting up from her chair, she grabbed her cane and hobbled over to the bathroom. She stared at the familiar and yet unwelcome face that looked back at her. </p>
<p>"What are you looking at?" she asked her reflection. (Great, now I'm talking to myself. Well, might as well give myself a piece of my mind)</p>
<p>"You're a class A screw up, you know it? Buring your head in the sand like some sort of demented ostrich. Everyone has problems, Sam, but they deal with them. They don't run away from them like a dog with its tail between its legs like you did." </p>
<p>"You used to be tough, or at least confident. Now you're a scaredy cat. What the Hell happened? Did smacking your head on Nic's windshield kill that part of your personality?" She was starting to wonder if she had lost her mind because she was actually waiting for an answer. </p>
<p>"Let's look at the situation. You got hit by a car and almost killed but you survived. And you ended up with the girl of your dreams. So the road was rocky for a while, what matters is the end result. Brooke loves you and that hasn't changed. So some people have a problem with that. So what? That isn't your problem. A jealous nutcase attacked you and that hurt but hurting Brooke was the wrong thing to do. For that you should be ashamed." </p>
<p>"And I am," (Oh, good, I have gone around the bend, I'm answering myself) she sighed. "And now, thanks to a seriously scary bout with depression, I've lost a lot of time. And I have a lot to answer for." Slowly, a small idea began to form in Sam's mind and she smiled at her reflection. </p>
<p>"Small steps, Sammy," she grinned. </p>
