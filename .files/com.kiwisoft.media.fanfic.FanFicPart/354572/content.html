<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 6 -->

<p>Faith stood in Buffy's arms with the goofiest smile on her face that she
could ever recall having. Finally she looked around the shop and noticed
Willow and Oz looking at them curiously. "As happy as I am about you not
kicking my ass and stuff, you might wanna let go B. Red's about to have a
conniption fit."</p>

<p>Buffy pulled away from Faith and blushed slightly. "Yeah, I would guess so.
She's not very fond of Missy so far. Now we're going to have to have a
reason for hugging since she thinks your Missy," Buffy said as her brain
started coming up with so many questions that she wanted to ask Faith and
she was sure Faith had just as many for her. "We need a reason to get out of
here so we can talk."</p>

<p>"Whatever you want B," Faith said casually as she got her drink from the
lady behind the counter.</p>

<p>"I know! Your boyfriend just broke up with you and you need someone to talk
to. That would explain the hug thing too right?"</p>

<p>"I don't know B. Me and boyfriend aren't really two things that go
together," Faith said. "You know me, just use 'em and discard 'em."</p>

<p>"Yeah but you're not you, you're Missy. God, this is all way too confusing.
How did you even find me here?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Later B. First we gotta get out of here."</p>

<p>"Right," Buffy replied as she watched Faith eat her pastry quickly. "Hungry
much?"</p>

<p>"Hey, I just got out of a coma. It's not like I've gotten to really eat in
the last few months. Come on, let's get back over there."</p>

<p>Faith started walking back towards where Willow and Oz were seated and Buffy
quickly caught up to her. "Try to look sad," Buffy instructed. Faith just
rolled her eyes and Buffy swatted her arm playfully, glad to have her friend
back even if there were still a lot of unresolved issues between the two of
them.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" Willow asked as soon as the two sat back down.</p>

<p>"Missy's having boyfriend troubles. She's pretty bummed about it aren't
you?" Buffy asked as she looked at Faith who seemed to be in a staring match
with Oz. After a few seconds of not responding Buffy nudged Faith in the
ribs with her elbow. "Aren't you Missy?" Buffy asked again.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah. It sucks," Faith said never breaking eye contact with Oz. "I
think I'm going to get out of here. I'm not really in a people kind of mood
now," Faith said, finally taking her eyes from Oz's.</p>

<p>"I'll come with you," Buffy said. "Maybe we could talk about it or
something," Buffy offered as she stood up with Faith.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's fiv...fine by me," Faith said as she shook her head. "See ya
around Willow," she called behind her shoulder as she walked out of the
shop.</p>

<p>"I'll see you tomorrow in class," Buffy said with an apologetic tone as she
went to follow Faith. When she got outside she saw Faith leaning against the
wall with a huge grin on her face. "What are you so happy about?" Buffy
teased as she linked arms with Faith as if nothing had ever gone wrong
between the two. "You almost blew your cover back there."</p>

<p>"Did not," Faith said defensively. "Besides, wolf boy already knows I'm not
Missy. I'm sure he'll tell Red all about it later."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Buffy asked, seeming like she wasn't really interested.</p>

<p>"So where are we going B?"</p>

<p>"Well I gotta go back to my mom's and grab some clothes, and then we can
head back to the dorms and talk." Buffy said.</p>

<p>"I don't know if that's the greatest idea B. I'm all up for telling your mom
I'm sorry for before and stuff but I just got out of a coma and I really
don't have the energy to defend myself tonight. Maybe we could just meet up
tomorrow or something?" Faith asked, wanting nothing more than to lie down
and sleep for a while. Even though she was a slayer, her body still needed
some time to get over being in a coma for the last few months.</p>

<p>"Nope, not happening. You're staying with me tonight. Besides, you've got me
on your side and mom's a forgiving person. Heck, she might not even be home
yet," Buffy told her.</p>

<p>"What, you don't trust me enough to be by myself for a while?" Faith asked.
She had meant it to seem like she was only teasing Buffy, but after she said
it she realized how serious of a question it was.</p>

<p>"I never said that Faith," Buffy replied. She too realized the importance of
the question and trust was one thing that had always been a problem between
the two. She knew that she didn't really trust Faith yet even though she
wanted to, and she didn't want to lie to the brunette so she answered the
question with one of her own. "Do I have any reason not to?"</p>

<p>Faith stopped walking and looked Buffy in the eyes. "Not anymore B," Faith
told her and the blonde could see the sincerity in her eyes. Buffy's smile
just grew as she tugged on Faith's hand and led the taller girl to her old
house. Faith sighed inwardly, upset that Buffy couldn't answer her question,
but more upset that she had actually expected Buffy to trust her already.</p>

<p>She snuck a glance at Buffy, who was still holding her hand and smiled when
she saw the smile on Buffy's face. For the first time that night she
realized just how happy Buffy was that she was back. Then and there she
vowed that she'd make up for her past mistakes knowing that whatever
troubles she'd face in the process would be worth it just see the blonde
smile the same smile she was at that moment.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Willow and Oz went their seperate ways, the red head decided to stop
by Buffy's dorm room on the way back to hers to check on the blonde and her
new roommate and maybe see why the two were acting so weird earlier. She
felt a little guilty for being a bit mean to the new girl, especially now
that she was going through some hard times with her boyfriend. When she
knocked on Buffy's door and she saw Missy open it with a small smile on her
lips she decided that maybe it was finally time to give the girl a chance.</p>

<p>"Hey Missy, is Buffy around?" Willow asked, unsure of what else to say.</p>

<p>"Uhh, not last time I checked," Missy replied. She wasn't sure if Faith had
ever found them or not so she didn't know exactly what to say to the red
head. The whole situation became too confusing for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought she'd still be here with you. I'm sorry to hear about your
boyfriend by the way. I hope everything works out for the two of you,"
Willow said sincerely.</p>

<p>Missy raised an eyebrow after Willow said that, wondering just what had
happened earlier that night. She realized Faith must have found the group
and that she was probably the one behind the whole boyfriend thing.
"Thanks," Missy simply said, playing along with whatever Faith started as
best as she could.</p>

<p>"I know I haven't been the nicest person to you so far, but if you ever need
to talk I'll be glad to listen," Willow said as she gave Missy a smile
before turning to walk away.</p>

<p>"Willow," Missy called after the girl. Willow stopped in the middle of the
hall and looked back at her. "I'll tell Buffy you stopped by for her," Missy
said with a goofy smile of her own. Willow didn't say anything else and went
on her way and Missy realized that the red head had definitely piqued her
curiousity.</p>

<hr>

<p>"See, now that wasn't bad was it?" Buffy asked Faith as they aproached the
UC Sunnydale campus. Buffy was carrying another duffle bag of clothes in one
hand while her other was holding Faith's.</p>

<p>"Only 'cuz your mom wasn't home yet," Faith smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she's going to flip when she gets back and notices someone ate her
out of house and home," Buffy teased.</p>

<p>"So what's with all the friendly vibes B? Last time I checked I tried to
kill your boyfriend and assist the mayor in ending the world and now I wake
up and your holding my hand. I don't get it." After Faith said that Buffy
tried to pull her hand from Faith's assuming the taller girl was
uncomfortable with it, but Faith just gripped her hand tighter so she
couldn't let go and smiled at her reassuringly.</p>

<p>"I thought we'd forgiven each other?" Buffy asked, not knowing what else to
say. She knew the two had a lot to talk about but she was so glad that Faith
was back and not trying to kill her she didn't really want to face the past.
"You're not the only one to blame for everything that happened Faith," Buffy
said before the brunette could respond to her question. "What you did still
hurts, and it probably will for a while. Hating you for it's not going to
get us anywhere, and before it all happened we were on our way to a really
great friendship. You're the only one who really understood me and you
taught me a lot. I just want to have another chance at that friendship if
it's not too late," Buffy confessed.</p>

<p>"Isn't that kinda supposed to be my speech?" Faith asked lightly. "I really
am sorry for everything that I did B. It just seemed to much easier to join
the other side, and then I started missing you and even the scoobies, but I
thought it was too late to come back so I just kept hurting you all even
though it hurt me too. After our fight, when I ended up in a coma, I figured
I was pretty much dead so I wanted to help you out."</p>

<p>"That's why you helped me in the dream?" Buffy asked as they reached her
dorm room.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I kinda was hoping that maybe you'd listen to me. I knew you'd find a
way to kill the mayor, but I thought that maybe if I tried to help, you'd be
able to forgive me if I ever woke up."</p>

<p>"Well then it's established. We're both sorry right?" Faith nodded at
Buffy's question. "Then it's all settled. Let's start over okay? Except this
time we try harder and don't keep secrets from each other."</p>

<p>"I think I can manage that. I don't promise anything though B. I'm pretty
fucked up sometimes, and I won't make a promise I don't know I can keep, but
I promise to try my best." Faith let go of Buffy's hand and leaned against
the wall, in no rush to go into the room since she kind of wanted to keep
Buffy to herself for a while longer.</p>

<p>"Good enough. Besides, it was kind of hard to find the fun without you,"
Buffy winked as she fumbled around for her key to the room.</p>

<p>"Aww, what's the matter B? Ain't getting enough uhhhh?" Faith asked with a
grunt.</p>

<p>"Not that it's any of your business, but no I haven't gotten any uh, uhhh
lately." Buffy shook her head as she opened the door to her room and walked
in with Faith trailing right behind her. When the two walked in Faith
immediately went to retrieve her pants that were sitting on the top of
Buffy's bed while Buffy noted Missy's happy expression as she greeted the
two. "What's with you?" Buffy inquired as she looked at Missy. She noticed
that Missy got distraced and was looking at Faith so she turned her
attention to the other brunette. "And what's with you?" Buffy asked as she
noticed Faith clinging to her pants as if they'd run away if she let go of
them.</p>

<p>"What?" Faith asked innocently. "Is it my fault if I missed my pants? You
know blue jeans aren't my thing." The two other girls just laughed and Buffy
collapsed onto her bed, exhausted from the days events.</p>

<p>"Hey, you never told me how you found me," Buffy reminded Faith.</p>

<p>"After I woke up I payed a visit to G-man 'cuz I remembered you saying
something about talking about me to him. So he told me that you were staying
here, and then I found Missy and she told me that you were out," Faith
explained as she layed down on Buffy's bed next to the blonde.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks for telling Willow I was having boyfriend troubles," Missy
interjected as she climbed under the covers into her bed since she was
already in her pj's.</p>

<p>"Sorry about that," Buffy replied as she sat up to unpack the clothes she
brought over in her duffle bag.</p>

<p>"Really, it's cool. Willow actually came by looking for you and we ended up
kinda being friends, I think," Missy told her.</p>

<p>"That's good," Buffy replied absently as she tossed some clothes to Faith.
"Go change into that so we can sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes m'am," Faith laughed out as she saluted Buffy before walking off to the
bathroom.</p>

<p>Buffy just shook her head and changed into her own pj's after Faith
dissapeared into the bathroom, not really caring about her modesty in front
of Missy. "I'm glad things are getting better between you two," Missy said
sleepily as she rolled onto her side to look at Buffy.</p>

<p>"Me too," Buffy replied with a smile. "I owe it to you too, because I would
have never gone to see her had it not been for you." Just after she said
that Faith came back into the room and the two girls decided it was best to
drop their conversation.</p>

<p>"So where am I sleeping B?" Faith asked as she stood by the wall awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Well I know my bed's kinda small but I was thinking you could sleep in
there with me. We don't really have the extra blankets and stuff to make you
a spot on the floor. Besides, you'd probably be more comfy in my bed than on
the floor even if we are kinda smushed together."</p>

<p>"Yeah sure B. Just don't wake me up when you go to class in the morning,"
Faith said with a smile. "I need my beauty sleep and all," Faith joked.</p>

<p>"Whatever," Buffy teased back as she pushed Faith into her bed, climbing
into it right after the taller girl. Missy watched the playful banter
between the two and noticed how it seemed they didn't even realize she even
existed while they were together. She wished there were something she could
to do make the two realize what any fool could see.</p>

<p>Her earlier conversation with Les came to mind as she remembered him saying
that love was something no one could control, and if they really did love
each other it would come to surface in it's own time when both were ready to
face it. She mumbled a soft 'goodnight' and turned off the lamp leaving the
room in darkness. She turned so her back was to the slayers so they could
have as much privacy as the small dorm room would allow.</p>

<p>Both slayers layed in Buffy's bed lost in similar thoughts. Neither
understood why becoming friends and forgiving each other was so easy but all
they knew was that it was right, and as a slayer you learn to trust your
instincts. There were still a lot of old wounds that needed healing but for
now they were content to just be laying side by side, taking comfort in the
others presence.</p>

<p>Buffy finally noticed that Faith was looking at her through the dark and
found the dark haired girl's hand under the covers and placed hers softly on
top of it. She had once realized that Faith was a very insecure person and
that's why she hid behind so many walls and the tuff girl image she had. It
took a lot of courage on Faith's part to try and turn her life around, and
Buffy realized this so she wanted to do her best to support Faith in any way
she could. The blonde moved so she was laying on her side facing Faith and
locked eyes with the younger girl. "Goodnight," she whispered as she
entwined her fingers with Faith's. Their eyes never left each others until
both fell into a peaceful sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning Buffy woke up late again, but only late enough so that she
had to rush to get to her class on time. Since Missy had already left for
her class, and Faith was still soundly sleeping she changed quickly in the
middle of the dorm room. As much as she knew Faith would be mad at her for
what she was about to do, she sat back down on her bed and nudged the
younger girl awake. "Morning Sunshine," Buffy teased.</p>

<p>"Sunshine my ass," Faith mumbled into her pillow.</p>

<p>"I know you didn't want me to wake you up, but I gotta go to class. I was
wondering if you'd meet me in the dining hall for lunch?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Won't Red be there too?" Faith looked up at Buffy, then closed her eyes
deciding she didn't like the light that early in the morning.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah she will be," Buffy replied sounding a little dissapointed.</p>

<p>"Of course, I could meet you there and we could just get this whole thing
out in the open already. If Red hears about this from Oz before you she'll
be pissed. Plus, if we tell her in a crowded place like the dining hall,
odds are she won't be as inclined to kill me."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I'm ready for that yet," Buffy told her as she noticed the
time on the clock. "Crap, I gotta go," Buffy called out as she grabbed her
bag and headed for the door.</p>

<p>"See ya at lunch," Faith yelled out at she pulled the covers up over her
head. Just a few seconds later she was happily asleep again.</p>

<p>Buffy ran down through the campus, bumping into a few people occasionally as
she rushed to class. She made it to class just before the bell and found a
seat in the back next to Willow and Oz. She didn't even have time to talk to
them since professor Walsh wasted no time in getting the class started.</p>

<p>Once the class began, Buffy remembered Faith saying she'd see her at lunch
and the blonde could only hope Faith was joking. It was probably selfish of
her to want to keep Faith a secret for longer and after trying it with Angel
in the past she knew it was wrong but it was a difficult situation for her.
Faith didn't have as much to loose since they weren't her friends where as
Buffy had to face them being angry at her for forgiving the brunette.</p>

<p>She sat through the rest of class spaced out, hoping that Faith would sleep
too late and miss lunch, but she knew that once the younger girl set her
mind to something there was no stopping her. Her college life hadn't started
off on the best note with her missing a class and not paying attention in
the others but she was too absorbed in her personal life to even care.</p>

<p>"Hey, earth to Buffy," Willow teased as she waved a hand in front of Buffy's
face. "You ready to go get some munchies?"</p>

<p>Buffy snapped out of her thoughts and noticed that class was over. She gave
her friend a sheepish smile and stood up. "Yeah, lets go get our munch on,"
Buffy replied, realizing the lameness of her own words.</p>

<p>The three walked to the dining hall in a comfortable silence, and when they
reached their destination Willow and Oz headed off to find a table while
Buffy grabbed a tray and got in line for food. Her eyes kept darting around
the room and she finally noticed that Oz and Willow were sitting with not
only Xander, but Missy as well. She knew it wasn't Faith from the way the
girl was dressed, and she was relieved that there was at least that
difference in the two girls.</p>

<p>Just seconds later Buffy felt a familiar tingling, fuzzy feeling wash over
her and she watched as Faith walked into the dining hall. She did her best
to hide behind her tray, not sure of what exactly she was supposed to do in
this situation and the guy behind her got her attention. "Ex boyfriend, or
loan shark?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Excuse me?" Buffy asked as she looked at him quickly, then her eyes trailed
back to Faith who was making her way to the table where the rest of the gang
was sitting and she could only groan knowing that this wasn't going to be a
peaceful lunch at all.</p>

<p>"The person you're hiding from," the male said again, trying to reclaim
Buffy's attention.</p>

<p>"Oh... Both, ugly break-up," Buffy said absently. She watched as the gang
noticed Faith's presence and she sighed to herself. She started to walk off
to go difuse the situation as best as she could but the guy called out to
her again.</p>

<p>"Parker Abrams," he stopped and held out his hand to Buffy while smiling at
her. For the first time Buffy noticed how cute the guy was and she gladly
shook his hand. "I'm at Kresge Hall."</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers, Stevenson," she told him while smiling at him before
realizing that she hadn't the time to be making new friends. "I gotta go,"
she said apologeticly.</p>

<p>"Ok, well, I'll see ya around Buffy Summers of Stevenson."</p>

<p>"See ya, Parker Abrams," Buffy gave him one last smile and walked over to
the gang, hoping that she would make it through this situation in one piece
so she could actually see the new guy around sometime.</p>
