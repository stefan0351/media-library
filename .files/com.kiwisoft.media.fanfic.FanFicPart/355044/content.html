<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 10 -->

<p>Faith landed beside the unconscious Buffy.</p>
<p>She picked her up and took her to the jeep. Faith easily found the keys in the jacket pocket and drove Buffy to Giles place.</p>
<p>As soon as they got there, Faith jumped out and ran to the other side, pulling Buffy out of the jeep and into her arms again. She carried Buffy to Giles front door.</p>
<p>"GILES!!! GILES OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR!" Faith yelled.</p>
<p>He did and when he saw what had happened he lead Faith over to the couch and made place to lay Buffy down on.</p>
<p>"W-what happened?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"When I got to her house she had just mainlined, heroin I think. In fact I'm pretty sure. That's some wicked strong shit! You have to do something! Another trip to the hospital and they'll arrest her for sure!"</p>
<p>"Yes, you were quite right to bring her here. I think I can help. Call Willow and tell her to come over here immediately with the book of shadows."</p>
<p>Faith did as she was told and Giles vanished into his bathroom, emerging with several bags of what Faith assumed were magic supplies.</p>
<p>Before long Willow was at the door with her book, and ready to help out.</p>
<p>"Ok, we are going to do a healing spell and if it goes well Buffy should be alright, however I'm afraid it's not all so easy."</p>
<p>"What?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>Willow looked at her feet.</p>
<p>"There's no magical cure for an addiction to heroin or any other drugs for that matter." Willow said</p>
<p>"Precisely. We can help her the best we can after this but I'm afraid it will go deeper than a few chants." Giles answered sadly.</p>
<p>"Whatever, just do this thing now." Faith said in a commanding tone.</p>
<p>With that Giles and Willow walked around Buffy, dropping some herbs and other things either on her or around her, all the while chanting in latin.</p>
<p>Suddenly the room filled with light and then flashed out.</p>
<p>"D-did it work?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Buffy, Buffy are you alright?" Giles questioned.</p>
<p>The smaller slayer who now appeared tiny slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>"What...what's going on? How did I get here? F-Faith? Is that you or is this some kind of dream?"</p>
<p>Faith came to her side.</p>
<p>"It's me B. I'm here for keeps now."</p>
<p>Buffy grabbed Faith's hand and held on tight.</p>
<p>"Faith...bad things have been happening. Bad bad things."</p>
<p>"Relax B. You need some rest. Let us take care of you and it'll be ok."</p>
<p>Buffy seemingly comforted lay back and shut her eyes.</p>
<p>"Well, I think we can safely say that it did what it was supposed to do." Willow said smiling.</p>
<p>"Yes, well it did what it could do. But as we said, it will take more than this. Temporarily she'll be fine, but soon...when she needs more...you see, as the slayer..pardon me, as one of the slayers I'm sure she's already addicted. The senses are so heightened, it would take much less for her. Perhaps only once or twice and she could be addicted. We have only a vague idea of how long this has been going on for..."</p>
<p>"4 days." Faith said.</p>
<p>"What? How can you be sure? You were in a coma remember?"</p>
<p>"I just know ok. It's a slayer thing."</p>
<p>Giles took that for what it was worth and dropped it.</p>
<p>"Giles, um mabey we should make her something to eat...she doesn't look to good."</p>
<p>"Good idea Willow, she is looking pale and rather thin."</p>
<p>Giles and Willow headed into the kitchen to prepare some broth for Buffy. Faith went back to her side.</p>
<p>"Faith...I..."</p>
<p>"I know B. Don't worry. I know all of it."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled a sad smile and started to well up.</p>
<p>"Hey B, come on. It's not that big a deal, I mean I know chicken broth is kind of bland but..."</p>
<p>The comment had the desired effect and Buffy smiled, a happier smile.</p>
<p>Buffy saw some paper and a pen on the coffee table in front of her.</p>
<p>"Umm Faith..."</p>
<p>"Yeah B?"</p>
<p>"Could you get me a drink of water?" Buffy asked sweetly.</p>
<p>"Sure B." Faith smiled, got up and went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>When she returned Buffy was gone. Just a note lay in her place.</p>
<p><i>Dear Faith, Giles, and Willow:<br> Thanks for all you did. You wanted to help. It meant alot to me, that you cared and everything. I've hurt you all so much, I don't want to stay here, I feel so guilty when I look at your faces. Now I know why Angel had to leave.<br> Always, Buffy</i></p>
<p>"Giles!" Faith shouted, he came running.</p>
<p>"What? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Faith held up the note. As he read it a look of despair crossed his face.</p>
<p>Willow too came into the room and read the note.</p>
<p>"Oh God. What is she going to do?"</p>
<p>"I know what. I'm going to get her. I'm going to do for her what she tried to do for me."</p>
<p>With that Faith left the house, Buffy had managed to get the keys off of her and had taken the jeep.</p>
<p>Faith allowed herself a small smile as she thought of Buffy's pickpocketing talent. And they said it was a lost art.</p>
<p>Although she hadn't been in Sunnydale long Faith knew how things worked. Her mom had been a drug addict. She knew the kinds of places the dealers had customers come to. She knew it all to well.</p>
<p>Faith headed to the seedy district of town, not sure where she was going, but knowing that it was urgent.</p>
<p>That was when she saw Joyce's jeep parked outside one of the worst appartments on the block.</p>
<p>Parked was a generous term. The jeep had been run up on the curb and was at an angle that left the rear open to be hit.</p>
<p>'She's a fucking junkie.' Faith thought.</p>
<p>'I've watched this too many times. Too many people I loved suffered this. I won't lose you Buffy. I just can't...if I did...'</p>
<p>Faith didn't want to think about it, she ran up the steps and into the dump.</p>
<p align="center">-----------------------Inside--------------------------</p>
<p>"What do you mean 200? Last time it was 100. You can't do this to me!"</p>
<p>"Yes I can. I can do whatever I want. You'll pay. Kid, your an addict! Nothing can keep you from you and your fix! I've seen it a million times. You make me sick."</p>
<p>Buffy knew she had been used, she felt...dirty.</p>
<p>"I make you sick?"</p>
<p>"You heard me. But hey, it's losers like you that fuel my bussiness. So I don't mind."</p>
<p>She was so desperate she pushed the feelings of use and abuse out of her mind.</p>
<p>"Whatever. Just hook me up. I'll pay you tommorow."</p>
<p>The guy laughed.</p>
<p>"How many times have I heard that. Never trust a junkie."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at the ground.</p>
<p>"But hey, you are a very nice looking girl, and I'm a nice guy...I think we can figure something out..."</p>
<p>He walked towards Buffy and stroked her cheek.</p>
<p>Buffy had a vague idea of what was going on, but she pushed the thought out of her head. That couldn't be what was going on...could it?</p>
<p>The guy's touch grew rougher and more demanding.</p>
<p>If she had been strong enough then she could have fought back, but had barely enough strength to tell him to stop.</p>
<p>"No. Leave me alone...just don't NO!!!!"</p>
<p>He had no intention of stopping.</p>
