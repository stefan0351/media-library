<!-- Second Chance \ Part 1 -->

<p>Six days and I'll be out of here. Six fucking days and I'll
be able to see her again. Of course, as happy as I am about it, I'm
scared as hell. I know I could have broken out of here long ago if I
wanted, but then B would never forgive me. As much as I hate this
place, and those girls trying to make me their 'bitch' and the
beatings from the guards every time I loose my temper, I had to stick
around for her. </p>

<p>"You've got a visitor," a guard calls out as she unlocks my
cell. I feel a small smile forming on my lips knowing its most likely
Angel. He's offered to hook me up with a place to stay when I get out
of here. He's going to flip when he finds out I'm going back to
SunnyD to make things up to B. I still can't get over how much he's
willing to help me though. I tried killing him a few times and taking
his soul, yet he's still forgiven me. I know he only forgave because
he knows how it feels to be in my situation, but it gives me hope
that if he can, maybe B will be able to forgive too.</p>

<p>Before I leave I grab the journal he gave me so I can share
some stuff with him. When he gave it to me I just laughed at him for
thinking I'd actually write in the damn thing but it's turned out to
be a big help. It's scary enough thinking some of the things I do,
but reading my thoughts is worse. It's good for me though, to have a
way to organize my thoughts and deal with my frustrations. Writing
them out always seems to help.</p>

<p>I let the guard cuff me and I follow her to the visiting
room. I'm a little surprised when she leads me to an empty room.
Normally we don't get to be alone with our visitors. We just have to
do the whole over the phone thing, but I suppose they figure since
I'm getting out it'll be okay. She uncuffs me then leaves the room
and I'm starting to wonder where the hell soul boy is.</p>

<p>Finally the door opens behind me and I turn around to see, no
not soul boy, but Buffy. My smile quickly fades but I try not to take
the defensive. I'm sure she didn't come to prison to kick my ass, and
if I fight I'll get one hell of a beating not only from her, but from
the guards. "Miss me?" I let a cocky smile spread across my lips and
she just walks past me to sit down at the other end of the table.</p>

<p>"Angel told me your getting out in a few days." From the look
in her eyes I can tell she's still really pissed at me. I want to
make some smart-ass comment but I know it's the wrong thing to do. I
can't play with her like I used to. I shrug and she gets straight to
the point. "Don't you even think about coming to finish what you
started. If you show your face in Sunnydale again I'll finish what I
started." She lowered her gaze to my stomach and I knew exactly what
she was talking about.</p>

<p>I wince and turn my eyes away from hers knowing there's no
way I could hide the hurt in them. "I really hope you don't mean
that," I say softly, not trusting my own voice. "I'm going to come
back, because I have to make things right with you somehow."</p>

<p>"It's too late for that Faith. I tried so many times to help
you but you pushed me away every time. Do you know how bad that hurt
me? To know one of my friends would push me away like that."</p>

<p>I realize talking with her now won't get us anywhere. We
don't have nearly enough time, and I know her anger won't go away
before she has to leave.  "I thought you were Angel, since he's the
only one who ever comes to visit me. Well Cordy came once insisting
that I let her give me a haircut but that didn't really count." I
stop and pick up my journal. She's looking at me puzzled, wondering
where the hell I'm going with this. "There's some stuff in here I was
going to share with him but I want you to have it. I really want to
make things right with you. If you read this you might believe me. No
more secrets B. Everything I am is in there. If you take it and read
it and still want to kick my ass out of Sunnydale when I get out,
feel free."</p>

<p>"Why should I believe anything in here is true?"</p>

<p>I'm trying my best not to loose my temper with her, but I
really want to yell at her. I know redemption isn't easy but I was
supposed to have time to prepare for seeing her again. Now I've gotta
shoot from the hip. "I didn't know you'd be coming here B. It's not
like I thought 'Oh, well she's coming so let me make up a lot of
bullshit and hope she buys it'. If you read that, you'll know
everything. You'll know why I did the things I did, you'll know how I
was before I came here, and you'll know how sorry I am." I stop and
bow my head. "And you'll know how I really feel about you."</p>

<p>I'm not looking at her, but I know she's wondering what the
hell that's supposed to mean. "How do you feel about me Faith?" Her
voice is finally soft, and for the first time she's let her wall down
in the few minutes she's been her. I lift my gaze so our eyes lock
and the anger isn't in there right now. For the first time in a long
time she's not looking at me like I'm shit so I take a deep breath
trying to get the nerve to tell her.</p>

<p>"B..." She gives me a small smile to encourage me to go on
and my heart starts being a million times faster. "I don't know how
to say it," I whisper.</p>

<p>"I thought you just said no more secrets Faith." She sounds a
little annoyed and I can tell she's putting her walls back up so I
quickly get the nerve to do what I've only dreamed about. I stand up
and walk to her and kneel down beside her. I brush a stray lock of
hair behind her ear and caress her cheek with my hand. "Faith?" she
questions what I'm doing almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>I smile at her, and as my mouth opens to speak the words I've
been longing to say to her the door to the room opens again and I
scurry away from her. I want to pounce on the guard and beat the shit
out of her for interrupting my moment, and as I look at B she's
obviously thinking the same thing. The lady walks over and cuffs me
again announcing that visiting hours are over. I'm sure B knows what
I was going to say to her anyways. We've always been able to read
each other like a book, maybe because of the slayer connection. I
tried my best to hide from her before but it obviously did no good so
this time I'll let her read as much as she wants.</p>

<p>As I turn around to walk out I feel her hand on my shoulder
stopping me. I turn around slowly expecting her to hit me, but
instead she pulls me into a soft hug. "Your still not forgiven you
know," she whispers. I wish I could have hugged her back, but since
my hands were cuffed there wasn't much I could do. </p>

<p>I give her a small smile when she lets go of me and walks
out. All the hell I just went through in prison, that one hug from
her made it all worthwhile. I know she's still pissed at me, but that
hug was a promise. A promise that I'll have my second chance. </p>
