<!-- Secret Desires \ Part 5 -->

<p>Brooke couldn't sit still any longer.  Her mind was going in
			all kinds of directions and all it did was confuse her and make her
			feel edgy. Why had she been feeling this way about Sam?  Was Sam
			gay?   She'd asked around about Shannon who apparently had to be at
			least bi. And she didn't understand why had it bothered her so much
			that Shannon wanted to buy Sam a Valentines Day gift. </p>
		<p>She got angry all over again at the thought of Shannon
			wanting Sam but the worse part was that she knew Shannon was right.
			She was afraid of her feelings and afraid of losing her throne.  And
			now she was afraid that Shannon might win Sam's heart.</p>
		<p>Brooke threw the remote down on the coffee table, grabbed her
			keys and stormed out the door having no idea where she was going.
			She just knew that she had to get out of the house for a little
			while before she went stir crazy.  She hoped that she could get her
			mind off of Sam, Shannon and what everything meant.</p>
		<p>Hearing a loud horn behind her, Brooke jumped and was torn out
			of her confused thoughts when she realized that the light was green.
			She decided to go back home because driving wasn't helping take her
			mind off things and if she kept drifting off like that she just
			might not make it home in one piece.</p>
		<p>At the next red light she was determind to stay out of her own
			head so she looked around and almost growled when she noticed a
			familiar car sitting out in front of one of the many jewelry stores
			on that shopping strip.  Looking through the huge front window was
			Shannon peering in one of the display cases. From the where she sat
			in her car, Brooke couldn't see exactly what the other girl was
			looking at, but if it was coming from that store she knew it was
			expensive.</p>
		<p>Again a horn startled her.  As she was about to turn away,
			Shannon turned to see what the noise was about, recognized her and
			gave her a knowing and slightly teasing half smirk before tuning
			back to her browsing.</p>
		<p>Brooke, for her part, gripped the steering wheel so hard her
			knuckles were turning white. Gritting her teeth, she drove on as the
			cars behind her continued to honk impatiently. </p>
		<p>OOOOh she is so wanting to get slapped! she angrily huffed as
			she made her
			way home. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p>After hanging up with Lily, Sam made her way to the kitchen to
			order a pizza. While she was waiting for her food to arrive she went
			in search of her blonde housemate.</p>
		<p>She was a little disappointed when she realized Brooke had left
			and she was alone. As she sat down to flick through the channels,
			she again wondered why Brooke and Shannon seemed so hostile toward
			each other.</p>
		<p>Then her mind started to wander.Should I have listened to Lily?
			Should I have put another one of my poems in
			the paper? She couldn't help but wonder why she did it anyway. She
			was trying to get over Brooke, not continue to remind herself how
			hopeless the situation was. Her thoughts were interrupted by the
			doorbell. She just shook her head and let out a frustrated sigh as
			she answered it.</p>
		<p>After eating, Sam realized sadly that Brooke probably wouldn't
			be home for some time so she wrapped up what was left of the pizza
			and went up to her room to do her homework.</p>
		<p>Around 9 PM Brooke came home and walked into the kitchen
			looking for something to eat. Noticing the pizza she pulled a peice
			out and heated it up. After seeing Shannon, Brooke had changed her
			mind about going home and went to Nicole's and they had gone to the
			mall. </p>
		<p>Nicole thought there was something weird about Brooke.  She
			seemed agitated and on a mission but when she asked the taller
			blonde, Brooke just kept saying she was fine and she just wanted to
			shop.  But after 6 jewelry shops, Nicole was very curious. Brooke
			usually only wants to shop for clothes. Quite skeptical, Nicole
			watched Brooke look in all the display counters.  The only things
			she was looking at were girl's lockets and pendants or something
			equally as mushy. Needless to say, Nicole was bored and happy when
			Brooke decided she was ready to go home.</p>
		<p>Brooke sat in the kitchen just nibbling on her pizza, not
			really hungry, wondering what possessed her to try and out do
			Shannon's gift. Rolling her eyes at the thought. She shopped for 2
			hours and didn't buy anything, mostly because she didn't know what
			Shannon was getting Sam.  So it was kind of hard to out do something
			when you have no clue what it is you are out doing. But also because
			this is Sam she was talking about. She was definitely far from
			materialistic, so she wouldn't be impressed. </p>
		<p>Getting mentally exhausted from her conflicting thoughts, Brooke
			stood up, put her plate in the sink and headed up to bed.  She hoped
			things would be a whole lot clearer in the morning, but she
			seriously doubted it.</p>
