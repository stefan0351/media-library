<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Twenty-Four -->

<p>As Andrea passed by the floor nurse's desk to get to Cassidy's room, the nurse stopped her. "Is something the matter?" She asked, feeling instantly anxious and thinking that maybe Cassidy was ill again. "Is Cassidy okay?" She demanded, gripping the edge of the desk.</p>
		<p>The nurse smiled reassuringly. "No, no." She said, shaking her head and dismissing Andrea's fears with a wave of her hand.</p>
		<p>"Then?" Andrea said, visibly relaxed.</p>
		<p>"Doctor Simmons wants to see you before you go in to see Ms. Monsignor." The nurse informed her, directing her down the hall towards the chief doctor's office, where the head doctor for the tour would lounge until their shift was over.</p>
		<p>Andrea found Ashleigh leaning back comfortably on her chair, her feet propped on the table and her hands clasped behind her head. Ashleigh straightened as Andrea walked in without knocking. She seemed worried, but she still smiled, standing up and giving Andrea a kiss on the cheek. Andrea kissed her back, and sat down on the chair Ashleigh indicated. "What's going on, Ashleigh?" Andrea asked right away.</p>
		<p>Andrea saw her anger, her upset. She was clenching the fist on her lap, and her jaw clenched. Ashleigh bit her lower lip, and seemed thoughtful, but then she said: "I have found out that Jeffrey was here."</p>
		<p>Andrea frowned, shaking her head. "But why would he come here?" She asked no one in particular.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh lifted her eyes from the desk to meet Andrea's. "Come on, Andrea," She chided. "To torture Cassidy, that's why he came here. He knows she's ill at this moment, and vulnerable. And he knows she loves you, he's always known and he's done his best to make her feel very uncomfortable about what's happening between you two." She paused, meeting Andrea's increasingly angry eyes, and then continued: "Jeffrey hates Cassidy, Andrea, and that's because he loves you.</p>
		<p>"He came here today and told her that you were pregnant, that you'd been planning this 'baby' for months, that you never broke up with him, and that you were waiting for her to come out of the hospital to go ahead and marry him. Cassidy believed him, and nothing I could say made her doubt his words. I mean, he went as far as to show her pair of wedding rings, for God's sake!" She shook her head slowly, sucking her teeth softly. "She can be a child when she's like this, sick and all. You know that, she'd believe anything anyone would tell her." She'd found out what had happened that morning from Cassidy herself, who had tearfully let it all out after Ashleigh questioned and pressured her into telling her what had happened.</p>
		<p>"That's absurd!" Andrea snapped. Her usually warm blue eyes were cold in her anger, and her usually sweet face was hard and flushed. "What a bastard." She muttered, staring at the floor. Suddenly, she stood up. "I have to go speak with Cassidy."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh stood up and followed her down the hall towards Cassidy's room. They stood outside the door and looked at each other. Ashleigh said with her controlled voice: "If I see him here again, I'll break his face."</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded. "That's if I don't kill him first." She said. "How <i>could</i> he?" She shook her head, thinking that perhaps Cassidy would not even want to see her. She hesitated, her hand on the doorknob. "Damn." She muttered, and opened the door slowly, walking in and pushing the door closed. Cassidy was lying on her side, her knees drawn up to her chest, her arms wrapped around her legs, eyes closed. Andrea approached the bed slowly, and then stood there, reaching out a tentative hand and touching her shoulder. "Cassidy."</p>
		<p>Cassidy jerked her shoulder away, tightening her arms around her legs. Andrea touched her shoulder again, and grabbed it, so that Cassidy could not pull away. Cassidy tried to pull away, but her position made it hard. She stopped trying to pull away, and simply allowed Andrea's hand to rest there, not acknowledging it any more. Andrea pulled at her shoulder, and forced her to lie on her back. Cassidy's eyes were closed; she wouldn't look at Andrea, her sensuous lips were set in a straight line. Unable to help herself, Andrea leaned down and kissed them softly, Cassidy turned her face away.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy," Andrea said softly. "I hope you don't believe what Jeffrey told you. <i>You</i> of all people must know that I wouldn't lie to you. I never have." She waited, waiting to see if Cassidy would respond.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't stop the tears that slid out of her eyes, nor could she stop her lower lip from trembling. She sat up, and covered her face with her hands. "I don't know what to believe." She whispered hoarsely. "He showed me that ring?"</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed softly, and Cassidy thought she was being ridiculed. "You can't possibly believe that!" She exclaimed, touching Cassidy's shoulder and kneading the tense muscles there. She could feel Cassidy begin to relax and lean more against her. "I think he had purchased them with the wish that I would eventually marry him." She whispered huskily, - becoming aroused and feeling need- close to her ear, feeling her shiver against her. "I don't think he was counting on my falling in love with you, baby. I <i>am</i> in love with you, Cassidy. I love you more than anything in this universe." She kissed below her ear softly, trailing along her fine strong jaw, and ended up pressing against her lips. "Do you believe me?" She asked softly against her lips, sitting down beside Cassidy slowly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's arms wrapped around her waist slowly, and they kissed fully on the lips; she slid her velvety tongue between her teeth. A sudden flash of heat began between Andrea's legs, becoming an aching throb and pumping hot flashes through her body. Andrea's arms wrapped around Cassidy's shoulders and they held their bodies frantically tight to one another. "Hmmm," Cassidy moaned softly, pulling her lips back slightly, though not breaking contact. She couldn't help herself; arousal was pumping through her body like blood. "So you're not pregnant?" She asked huskily, beyond the point of caring.</p>
		<p>Andrea pulled back and looked into her eyes. "No." She whispered. "He lied, Cassidy, when will you understand that?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy didn't respond; she just pushed Andrea onto her back, her head at the foot of the bed. Lying heavily on top of her, she kissed her fully on the lips, her tongue working its way into the responding hot mouth once again. She pressed her body against her frantically, hips between her legs, and feverishly began kissing her. Both women moaned softly, hands frantically searching as they lost control of any inhibitions that had invaded their thoughts.</p>
		<p>Afterwards, lying in a deep lassitude of afterglow after their brief lovemaking session, they talked in quiet tones. Andrea's lips were pressed against Cassidy's forehead, her arms around her shoulders and her fingers sifting through the thick dark hair. Cassidy's head rested on Andrea's half-clothed chest, her fingers playing at the band of Andrea's opened pants. "So you're not pregnant?" Cassidy asked again, her lips nibbling on the fleshy skin of Andrea's chest.</p>
		<p>Andrea pulled her head back, and looked into Cassidy's eyes, feeling a tad bit annoyed. She knew that Cassidy would be insecure about them, and she understood too how she felt. If she'd been in Cassidy's shoes, she would be feeling the same way. "I don't want to have to tell you again that Jeffrey lied, Cassidy. <i>You</i>, of all people, should know that I don't lie." She said sternly and Cassidy looked suitably embarrassed.</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, and kissed her softly. "I do not like Jeffrey." She whispered, looking once again into Andrea's eyes. "I never have, and he's never liked me."</p>
		<p>"I just realized that myself." Andrea answered, and a sheepish smile took over her face. "I guess I wasn't paying that much attention." She shook herself. "But enough about that. Why don't we talk <i>us</i>?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy sat up, and Andrea did too. "What is there to talk about? We are together, are we not?" Cassidy said shortly, she was never good at talking about relationships. She'd been so used to getting her way with women, meaning just sexually. And now that the woman that she loved with all her heart was opening a talk about their future, she didn't know how to deal with it.</p>
		<p>Andrea, who knew all about Cassidy, smiled, stroking Cassidy's back with her opened palm. "You are something else, Cassidy." She whispered softly close to her ear, and she felt Cassidy shiver. "I want to spend the rest of my life with you, honey, that's what there is to say."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes, she couldn't believe she'd just heard those words. "But what if this is just a phase for you, Andy." She protested in a faltering voice. "What if what you feel for me is not real, but a passing passion?"</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed, flopping herself onto her back, throwing an arm over her eyes. "Do I have to make a point of proving myself to you, Cassidy?" She said with exasperation. "You are one incredibly stubborn woman, do you know that?" She demanded, lifting her arm and peering at Cassidy from underneath it.</p>
		<p>Cassidy bowed her head, and stared at her lap quietly. She just didn't want to get hurt. "I do not want to get hurt, Andrea." She said slowly, echoing her feelings.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat up quickly, and rested her head comfortingly on her shoulder, wrapping an arm around her neck. She took a deep breath, and smelled the ever-present sweet scent of Cassidy's skin. "I love you more than anything, Cassidy. I love you more than words can say." She whispered softly. "When I first realized that I was feeling something for you, I was so confused. I didn't know what to do, or how to tell you. I thought you'd want to end our friendship and never talk to me again. I didn't know you were feeling something for me too." She looked at Cassidy with thoughtful eyes.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was staring off somewhere, biting her lower lip as she thought. "I was already going crazy with love for you by the time we were in high school. I did not know I-" She broke off, her eyebrows crunching together as she recalled her torturous feelings so long ago. "I realized it when I, you know, cut myself," She seemed a little embarrassed, but Andrea didn't allow her to be, she kissed her tenderly on the cheek and waited silently for her to continue. Cassidy did. "When you were by my side," She whispered, tears coming to her eyes. "Day and night."</p>
		<p>Andrea pulled her close, turning her face and pressing it to her neck. She whispered sweet things in Cassidy's ear until she calmed.</p>
		<p>"I have put you through a lot, haven't I?" Cassidy whispered against her skin, kissing softly, wanting more of Andrea, not caring if someone walked in. She wrapped her strong arms around Andrea and pulled her closer, turning towards her and pushing them down.</p>
		<p>"Uh-huh, you've put me through a lot," Andrea whispered distractedly, her hands already touching the skin of Cassidy's bare firm back, arousing her anew. She paused, and met Cassidy's sexy eyes. "But you know what?" She said, moving her lips closer to her lover's.</p>
		<p>"What?" Cassidy whispered hoarsely, her eyes already closing as she turned towards her, her lips brushing against Andrea's. She was breathing hard, her hands already moving into Andrea's pants, pushing them down.</p>
		<p>Andrea moaned softly, her arms tightening around Cassidy's shoulders. "We can only count on Ashleigh to let us get away with this in a hospital room." She whispered, and her lips were Cassidy's for the taking, her body willingly becoming a temple to be admired and explored by Cassidy's expert, knowing hands. Openly giving her body in a sweet surrender.</p>
