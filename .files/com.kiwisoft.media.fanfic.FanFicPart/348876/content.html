<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 20 - Life-Signs-->

<P>"Janeway to Voyager, I've entered the atmosphere. Bio-electric turbulence is
within reasonable levels." </P>
<P>Janeway checked the readouts from the sensors; all systems seemed to be
functioning normally. Although Tom had remodulated the shielding on the Delta
Flyer, the ride was still bumpier than she had imagined. </P>
<P>The unstable temporal distortion had constantly changed in an erratic manner,
making the time on the planet run faster than normal, or in some cases even
slower. The number of changes made it difficult to calculate just how much time
had went by on the planet, combined with the ever-increasing bio-electric field,
the crew of Voyager had no idea how their Chief Engineer, Astrometrics Officer,
and beloved Hydroponics Bay Ensign were coping.</P>
<P>The familiar static voice foreshadowed a communications loss. Janeway was
hoping she could keep in contact with Voyager long enough to send them the
co-ordinates of their missing crew members, but the Delta Flyer's sensors seemed
to be having just as much trouble penetrating the bio-electric field. </P>
<P>Putting the Delta Flyer on auto-pilot, Janeway focused on remodulating the
sensors. Although Harry had done a good job on them already, Janeway was
determined on increasing the range of the sensors. The constant bumping of the
ship didn't distract the Captain at all. Her mind set, Janeway tried everything
she knew to break through the bio-electric field.</P>
<P>After a few minutes of focused work, the bumping suddenly stopped, which in
turn stopped the Captain. The readings showed that the bio-electric field was
most concentrated at the outer atmosphere, thereby making entry the bumpiest
ride of all. Renewed hopes of being able to locate Seven drove the Captain on.
Re-routing power from weapons, shields, and finally life-support, the Captain
managed to get one faint life-sign. Unable to determine which one of the three
crewmembers it was, Janeway crossed her fingers. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Still glowing from the passionate, watery lovemaking, Seven held a freezing
B'Elanna in her arms, sitting on B'Elanna's Starfleet jacket. Only slightly
removed from the waterfall, the two snuggled close for warmth. Wet skin slid
along still more wet skin, as they tried to find a comfortable position.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven whispered softly into B'Elanna's ear.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's head perked up from Seven's warm bosom, her eyes seeking the
depths of Seven's soul.</P>
<P>"I should be the one saying thank you." </P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled, softly bringing her hand to Seven's chin and drawing her in
for a kiss. Sweet, soft, and gentle, the kiss lasted longer than intended.
Seven's arms protectively closed around B'Elanna's body, pulling her closer.
</P>
<P>Normally, Seven would have argued the point, but she didn't feel the need to,
especially with B'Elanna's lips on her own.</P>
<P>Fighting the urge to continue, B'Elanna reluctantly pulled away, but smiled
reassurance.</P>
<P>"I think we should try to get dry before nightfall," B'Elanna almost
giggled.</P>
<P>"That will be a difficult task, considering," Seven said with a mischievous
grin.</P>
<P>"Considering what?" B'Elanna said in a mockingly shocked tone.</P>
<P>Seven quickly closed her mouth around B'Elanna's open one, and lightly
caressed B'Elanna's tongue with her own. Pulling away teasingly, Seven took
B'Elanna's hand in her human one and interlocked their fingers.</P>
<P>"Considering that I will not let you go."</P>
<P>B'Elanna raised her eyebrow at the response, then brought their hands up to
her mouth and closed her lips around Seven's hand, kissing her way up her
lover's arm, careful to avoid the Borg implant. </P>
<P>"So you think you can contain a Klingon huh?" B'Elanna murmured, her lips
closing on Seven's silken shoulder.</P>
<P>"I do not think. I know."</P>
<P>Seven lowered her head to her shoulder, brushing her lips against B'Elanna's
waiting mouth. The Lieutenant gave Seven one quick final kiss before
unexpectedly jumping up and out of the Borg's arms. B'Elanna playfully grabbed
her pants and gray tank-top lying in the watery pool.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna asked teasingly, while twirling her soaked shirt. "You
didn't think I was going to let a challenge go unchallenged did you?"</P>
<P>Raising an eyebrow at B'Elanna, Seven's eyes glided along B'Elanna's smooth
skin, starting at the hand twirling the wet shirt, all the way to B'Elanna's
glistening breasts, which brought a smile to the Borg's lips.</P>
<P>"Naughty girl, Seven." </P>
<P>B'Elanna half-covered her breasts with her shirt and her nether-regions with
her pants.</P>
<P>"If you want full access to my systems, you'll have to catch me first."</P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her lips seductively, and made a full 180, effectively
bearing her butt to Seven, then slowly walked towards the cave entrance, swaying
her hips, and disappearing around the corner.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed hard, her mouth watery from B'Elanna's suggestive display. On
shaky legs, Seven pulled herself up and gathered her wet bio-suit, along with
B'Elanna's unmentionables. Wringing then tying B'Elanna's panties to her
no-longer bleeding shoulder, Seven took the time to bask in the silky-smoothness
of B'Elanna's bra, the scent only increasing her desire.</P>
<P>Deciding that it would take too much time to get dressed, in wet clothing no
less, Seven headed towards the entrance in search of her lover.</P>
<P>Outside the cave, in the breezy air, the sun was still shining brightly, more
than making up for the cool wind that entered the cave. </P>
<P>"Hmmm. Guess it's not close to nightfall after all," B'Elanna murmured to
herself.</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned around to see if Seven was coming, but all she saw was the
darkness of the cave, and something shining from the corner of her eye. It
turned out to be a cracked open rock, but not just any rock, it was tergralium,
a new element Voyager had discovered only a few weeks ago. </P>
<P>It had a knack of masking life-signs, something the Captain thought would be
useful in masking the life-signs of Voyager's crew in case of an emergency. Only
now, It was a problem, because the whole cave seemed to be made of the stuff. If
Voyager had somehow been able to scan for life-signs sometime within the last
few hours, then they would have completely missed the two of them.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's mind worked over the worst possible scenario, in which the crew
only had one chance to scan for life-signs, and that chance had already passed.
But the Engineer inside her head told her that it was useless worrying over
possible scenarios, and all that really mattered was that at least she was
outside the cave, ready to be scanned.</P>
