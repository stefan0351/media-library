<!-- Fire and Ice \ Part 6 -->

<P>Alex awoke to a deep seeded pulling sensation. As she came to her senses, she discovered Danielle was gently
suckling her breast. She opened her eyes and watched as the young woman efforts became more concentrated. A spasm
shot through her as Danielle gently nipped the hardened point, and she groaned in pleasure.</P>
<P>The young woman lifted her head and looked up innocently. &quot;I didn’t mean to wake you. I guess, I got carried
away. I couldn’t resist. You looked so luscious lying here.&quot; Surprised by the frankness of her own words,
her face colored beautifully.</P>
<P>Alex smiled and caressed her cheek. &quot;So do you.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle’s eyes blazed with desire as they ran the length of her lover’s body, finally fixing on Alex’s breasts.
&quot;Your nipples responded to my touch, even when you were sleeping.&quot; She said proudly, barely resisting
the urge to casually swirl her tongue over the sensitive flesh already stiff with desire.</P>
<P>It was Alex’s turn to blush. She didn’t usually sleep so soundly. In fact, she was stunned that she hadn’t been
awakened by her lover’s ministrations sooner. She could not remember the last time she had slept through the entire
night, or felt so at peace. The edgy tension that was so much a part of her was gone.</P>
<P>&quot;What a wonderful way to wake...&quot; Her words were abruptly cut off as Danielle ran her finger lightly
across Alex’s sex and held the glistening digit up to the light, marveling at the sight. She slowly ran her tongue
over her finger, sampling her lover’s essence. The erotic act sent a shiver thorough Alex.</P>
<P>Danielle met her gaze and smiled playfully. &quot;I want more.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex inhaled sharply as the implications of her words slammed home. Before she could recover, she felt Danielle’s
hair tickle her skin as her eager lover’s tongue blazed a hot trail down her anxious body.</P>
<P>&quot;I want to feel you climax... with my mouth.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle’s breath blew lightly against her sex. Alex eagerly lifted her hips. The first contact was a long gentle
stroke, the full length of her sex. It was nearly Alex’s undoing. Her body surged with desire, responding to her
younger lover’s caress.</P>
<P>Danielle was thorough in her exploration. Her lips gently encircled her swollen clit, eliciting a moan from
her lover. She flicked her tongue over the tip in a teasingly slow rhythm that was as steady and persistent as
her own heartbeat. Each stroke was timed so precisely that Alex knew it was coming an instant before the contact
was made. Her inner muscles clenched each time in anticipation. Danielle’s touch was maddeningly light. Alex tried
to thrust her hips forward to force greater contact, but Danielle’s left hand pressed down on her lower abdomen,
commanding her to be still.</P>
<P>It was all Alex could do not to use her superior strength. The temptation to rock her hips into Danielle’s touch
was irresistible. &quot;I need more.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle lifted her head for but a moment. &quot;I know.&quot; She smiled and lowered her mouth once again to
the sensitive nub, teasing her mercilessly.</P>
<P>Alex exhaled a long anguished moan. The world drifted away until there was nothing but the persistent attentions
of Danielle’s tongue, the gentle impact of each touch. The pulsing between her legs was driving her wild and Alex
trembled as she strained for release.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Danielle’s fingertips brushed her thigh, adding a new sensation. The determined fingers traveled slowly
up to her sex. Alex stiffened and groaned as her lover’s tentative fingers pressed against her opening, seeking
entrance. &quot;Yesss!&quot;</P>
<P>As Danielle pushed deep inside, Alex’s restraint snapped. The feel of Danielle inside her sent currents of pleasure
through her body. She grasped Danielle’s head with both hands. The young woman yielded and slid her tongue back
and forth with increasing pressure while pumping firmly inside her.</P>
<P>Her inner walls clutched at Danielle’s fingers with each thrust. She sucked in a long, deep breath, and stiffened
in climax. Her thighs shook and she pushed against Danielle’s diligent tongue. She shuddered, her sex pulsing with
sensation.</P>
<P>Danielle held her, stroking her hair. &quot;I love you Alex.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex looked into the green eyes that gazed at her, brimming with adoration. &quot;And I love you. You were wonderful.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle sighed happily. &quot;I was given excellent instruction.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Apparently...&quot; Alex smiled. &quot;But I don’t recall that particular lesson.&quot;</P>
<P>She kissed her lightly. Danielle was happy that she had pleased her, but she sensed that Alex had held back.
The raw passion that burned inside her had not been released. She felt the power of the untapped energy within
Alex so keenly that it crackled like static on the surface of her skin. She ran her fingers over the fine hair
below Alex’s navel, expecting it to cling to the tips of her fingers.</P>
<P>In time, her love would help Alex let go of the guilt and pain she carried. Only when Alex allowed herself to
be vulnerable, allowed herself to trust, would she at last unleash her full capacity to be loved. With time, Danielle
was determined to earn that trust and take her lover where only she could.</P>
<P>She took a deep breath and rested her head on Alex’s soft breast. &quot;It feels like I’m awake in my dreams.
I’m so happy.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex closed her arms around her beautiful lover and made a silent wish that she would never forget this moment.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>The delicious scent of sex filled the room. Danielle was insatiable, proving the perfect match for her energetic
lover. They made love all morning, napping until early afternoon, their bodies entwined.</P>
<P>When Alex awoke Danielle was asleep on her breast. The feeling engulfing her was foreign and powerful. She was
happy. Alex wrapped her arm around her lover’s waist, causing Danielle to stir.</P>
<P>&quot;Been awake long?&quot; Danielle asked dreamily.</P>
<P>&quot;No.&quot; Alex replied kissing her lightly. Danielle looked at her wistfully.</P>
<P>&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Alex questioned.</P>
<P>&quot;I was just thinking that I will never forget this room, this cabin, these woods.&quot; Danielle looked
at Alex seriously. &quot;We won’t be able to stay much longer, will we?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I’m sorry. Will you mind?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle shook her head. &quot;As long as I have you, I can be happy anywhere.&quot; Alex held her close.</P>
<P>&quot;Where will we go?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where would you like to go?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’ve always wanted to see Greece.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled. She had similar dreams. &quot;I think that can be arranged.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can we afford it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Money isn’t a problem. I...&quot; Alex stopped talking as memories of her past sins surfaced. She looked
at Danielle with deep regret.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m truly sorry about the robbery. If I could get your uncle’s things back I would. They’re gone.&quot;
She took a deep breath and waited for Danielle’s anger to arise.</P>
<P>&quot;It’s only money Alex. My uncle has lots of it. It doesn’t matter.&quot; She tried to reassure her, but
felt Alex almost imperceptibly distance herself.</P>
<P>After several minutes Alex put her arms around Danielle and looked into her eyes.</P>
<P>&quot;What... What is it?&quot; Danielle asked.</P>
<P>&quot;You are so quick to forgive.&quot; Danielle looked puzzled by Alex’s remark.</P>
<P>&quot;You know... the robbery, the journal... the deception.&quot; The words made Alex wince. She looked away,
but not before Danielle saw the sadness in her eyes.</P>
<P>Danielle turned on her side to face Alex directly. &quot;Well, you didn’t know me, when you tied me up so I
gave you some latitude on that one.&quot; She smiled lightly and shrugged. &quot;As for the journal, I admit at
first it felt like a terrible invasion, but...&quot; She paused. &quot;Alex why <B>did</B> you take my journal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m not sure. There was something about the design on the front that attracted me. I didn’t even know
what it was.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then... not much to forgive there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It’s that easy, huh?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, no&quot; Danielle said thoughtfully. &quot;I’ve been thinking of ways for you to make up for those
little indiscretions, believe me.&quot; She winked playfully.</P>
<P>Alex looked back seriously. &quot;I intend to spend the rest of my life making things right.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle smiled, refusing to let her lover lapse into guilt, &quot;It shouldn’t be such a difficult task. I
can think of some very pleasurable ways for you to do that.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex looked off into the distance. Danielle waved her hand in front of her lover’s face. &quot;Hey, I was hoping
that would make you happy.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled for Danielle’s benefit. The love she saw on the young woman’s face was so genuine.</P>
<P>Danielle stroked her lover’s cheek. &quot;I can see the wheels turning. What are you thinking?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex glanced away, unable to mask her feelings from this incredible woman. Danielle looked deep into her lovers’
eyes. &quot;You know that I love you. There’s nothing that can change that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wish that were true.&quot; Alex replied doubtfully. Danielle opened her mouth to speak but Alex continued.
&quot;You don’t really know me... at least you don’t know who I used to be.&quot; Danielle remained quiet. &quot;
If you knew everything about me, you wouldn’t be able to love me.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle took Alex’s hand and pressed it to her lips. &quot;Alex I can tell you that nothing from your past
will ever change the way I feel about you. But I can’t prove it to you unless you take the first step and talk
to me. I know it’s scary, but you’re going to have to trust me.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex slid out of bed and put on her robe. &quot;Let's get this over with, but not here.&quot; Alex couldn’t
bear to taint the memories of their incredible love making with the ugly tale she was about to tell. Danielle followed
in silence out to the deck and pulled up a chair next to her. She watched as Alex poured a glass of scotch, then
took her hand in support.</P>
<P>Alex took a sip. &quot;I want to start at the beginning. I can’t justify what I have done. But I need you to
know it all. If you decide to leave me, I’ll understand.&quot; Danielle nodded and with a deep sigh, Alex began.
&quot;Power has always been a lure for me. I’m drawn to it, intrigued by it. All my life I was drawn to people
who had it and intrigued by how they used it. At a young age I realized I could use sex to my advantage, to exert
control. I used my body to get what I wanted. It was a powerful tool in those early days, an easy way to manipulate
people.&quot; Her grip tightened and she raised her eyes to meet Danielle’s. &quot;It never meant anything to me...
not until now... not until you.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle squeezed her hand reassuringly.</P>
<P>The tender gesture filled Alex with such relief that she was tempted to stop and take the young woman in her
arms. She forced herself to continue. &quot;I grew up in a bad part of the city, a rough neighborhood. My father
walked out on us when I was very young and mother had her hands full trying to care for the three of us. She seemed
powerless and weak. Others controlled her. I was young and foolish then and had no idea of the inner strength she
possessed. I only knew her life wasn’t for me. In nature, the strong survived and I intended to be a survivor.</P>
<P>&quot;I talked my younger brother into joining a gang with me, convincing him that it was the best way to protect
what was ours. I had a knack for leading people and in no time I controlled the small group of street kids. They
were fearless and had a ruthless reputation that was well-earned. Soon our small territory wasn’t enough for me.
I wanted more... more power, more control. And I got it. But for a terrible price, my brother’s life. He was stabbed
during a skirmish with a rival gang and died instantly. He had been the calm voice of reason in my world. Without
his steadying influence, I allowed rage to envelope me.</P>
<P>&quot;It didn’t take me long to track down the kid who killed him. I broke into his house and cornered him in
his own bedroom. He was smaller than me and it was easy to grab him from behind. Without a second thought I slit
his throat. His warm blood spilled from his body over my hands and it was done.&quot; She clasped her trembling
fingers in her lap in an attempt to cover the blood only she could see there. &quot;When I released him, he dropped
to the floor, dead. I remember looking at his motionless body, amazed at how easily I had ended his life. I...&quot;
Her voice cracked with emotion as she replayed the memory. &quot;I heard a noise and looked up. His kid brother,
no more than 5 years old had witnessed the whole thing. He sat cowering in bed, whimpering helplessly. I’ll never
forget the look on his face. <B>I</B> was his worst nightmare come to life, a monster. It was as if he had held
a mirror to my face. For the first time I understood what I was all about. There was no going back. I knew my soul
was lost.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle saw the anguish on Alex’s face and held her hands in an attempt to comfort her.</P>
<P>Alex looked right through her. Her eyes filled with regret. &quot;There are some things that can’t be atoned
for.&quot; She freed her hands and took a long swallow of scotch. It didn’t help. The entire bottle would not have
been enough to dull her memory sufficiently. &quot;My mother was heart broken by my brother’s death. I saw the
scorn in her eyes whenever she looked at me. Both she and my elder brother blamed me. They understood the evil
I was capable of even back then. They wanted to be free of me.&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;I can’t blame
them. I was responsible for his death as surly as if I had wielded the knife that killed him.</P>
<P>&quot;I feared if I gave into my grief, I would not survive it. The gang was all I had to keep me going. I let
my anger consume me. They respected strength and detested weakness. The course of my life was set. I allowed myself
to be ruled by anger and pride. Those who knew me, feared me. This became one of my strongest weapons against my
enemies. My reputation was becoming widespread. It wasn’t long before the gang wasn't enough. Soon, I was recruited
by a middleman for a large and powerful crime ring. In no time I had his job. The position was a stepping stone
to the people who had real power.</P>
<P>&quot;By now, I had proven myself sufficiently and had come to the attention of Julian Sezaree, a powerful crime
boss. He was intelligent, charismatic and even more ambitious than I. In addition, he had the vision my youth lacked
and showed me possibilities I had not even dreamed of. I was easily tempted by his promises of wealth and power.&quot;
She shook her head and took another drink. &quot;He had me figured me out from the beginning. I was eager to learn
everything that he had to teach. I got into high end jewel and art crime, and even an occasional bank robbery.
I was never so naive that I trusted him completely. But I was naive enough to think that I could keep one step
ahead of him. I was young and stupid.</P>
<P>&quot;I never worked with Julian directly back then. I was too green. In those early years, my work was sloppy
and people died because of it. Although I always got the job done, Julian was often angered by my lack of planning.
Eventually he set me up with partners who trained me in the areas I was weak. I was more than willing to do whatever
it took to improve.</P>
<P>&quot;I had learned well and went a number of years without a single kill. I meticulously planned every robbery.
Soon, Julian was confident using me for the more important jobs. Things were going well, until I made a grave error.
I trusted my partner and Julian. We were to steal a valuable collection of art work from a senator’s house. Julian
put my partner in charge of the details. The job was poorly planned. The senator and his wife returned home before
we were finished and in a rash move, I killed the senator. His wife watched in horror as his life blood bubbled
from the open gash in his throat. I dropped him and went for her. She never moved. She looked right at me. Her
eyes...&quot;</P>
<P>Alex paused and struggled to continue. &quot;There was something about her eyes that made me think back to that
first one... and that little boy. I don’t know what came over me but I dropped the knife and pulled off my mask.
That’s all I remember. My partner said I froze and he had to finish the wife. He told me that I just stood there
for nearly fifteen minutes. It would have ended there if he had left me, but he didn’t. Later, I found out why.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I knew I couldn’t do it anymore and went to Julian. He laughed and said it was a little late in the game
to be developing a conscience. He told me emotions made people weak, that I had a lifetime of money to make for
him. It was far from over for me. I told him I was finished, knowing it might cost me my life and not caring. That’s
when he showed me the tape my partner had made of me killing the senator. That in itself wasn’t enough to hold
me and he knew it. He taunted me with my mother’s life, said how easy it would be for she and my brother to have
an accident. He owned me and he knew it.</P>
<P>&quot;That was four years ago. He gets about 5 million a year from me and leaves my family alone.&quot; She
paused. &quot;I’ve done some terrible things. Things I can’t change. But please believe me when I say that all
I want now is to be out. I can’t do it anymore.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don’t have to. You can stop.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m not sure I can. I’ve wanted to before… but Julian’s too powerful.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Before, you were alone. Now, you're not.&quot; Danielle spoke softly.</P>
<P>Alex searched her face for any hint of misgiving, afraid to believe Danielle would want to stay with her after
everything she heard. &quot;Are you saying... you still want to be with me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, nothing will ever change that.&quot; She took Alex’s trembling hands in her own. &quot;I’ll always
be here for you.&quot; Danielle’s love seemed unshakable.</P>
<P>Alex was deeply moved by her loyalty. &quot;Why? After everything I...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alex, the past is written. We can’t change it. I still love you, I always will. But, I think you know
that. What you’re reluctant to believe is that you deserve my love.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle lovingly brushed her cheek. &quot;You do. I’m not going anywhere. Together we’ll find our path. Our
life together starts here and now.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex would have no more lies or deceptions between them. She paused and took her hands. &quot;Danielle, I only
know of one way to get out from under Julian’s control. As long as he’s alive I can never be free. He will never
let me go. The only way we can have a life together is if he’s dead. He’s asked me to do a special job for him.
I’m going to use it to lure him in and finish something I should have taken care of a long time ago. I’m going
to kill him.&quot;</P>
<P>The disapproval in Danielle’s eyes was plain.</P>
<P>Alex avoided her glance. &quot;First, I have to get you out of town. Make sure your safe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alex, I’m not leaving.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please Danielle, I need you to do this for me.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle could not mask her frustration. &quot;Alex, if you knew I was facing a danger from my past, would you
leave me, to protect yourself? If I asked you to walk away, told you I needed for you to be safe would you go?
Could you leave me?&quot;</P>
<P>The answer was too obvious to verbalize. They both knew it.</P>
<P>&quot;And why do you think it is any different for me?&quot; She took Alex in her arms and kissed her tenderly,
leaving no doubt about her complete devotion. She gently pulled back and held Alex’s face lovingly in her hands.</P>
<P>&quot;There is nothing anyone can do to make me leave you. Not even you. Whatever the consequences I’m willing
to pay them, because the alternative is unthinkable.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex knew with certainty that her salvation lie with this young woman.</P>
<P>&quot;You're not alone anymore. Together we're stronger than we could ever be apart. There’s a way out of this
and we’re going to find it… together.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex pulled Danielle to her, hugging her close.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>She led Danielle into the bedroom and pushed the night stand aside, lifting several loose floor boards. A small
safe was cemented into the floor. &quot;Julian wasn’t the only one to think of blackmail. I have enough documentation
to send him to prison for life, but not without implicating myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There’s no chance you could get immunity for the information?&quot; Danielle asked.</P>
<P>&quot;I’ll never get immunity. I’ve done things that can't be forgiven. It’s not politically expedient to grant
immunity to someone who has committed the crimes I have. No politician is going to take that kind of risk, not
even to nail Julian. And if by some miracle they did, Julian’s people would get to me. I wouldn’t last a week.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There must be a way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think there is.&quot; Alex paused, knowing her lover would not approve. &quot;He wants me to steal van
Gogh’s 'Corridor in the Asylum' from the Museum of Modern Art.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You aren’t going to do it, are you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am. This will be the last.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tomorrow night. For some reason this is important to him, more than he’s letting on. I think I can get
him to deal with me directly, maybe even collect it from me personally. I’ll arrange a meeting with him after I
have it.&quot; She hesitated before continuing. &quot;I plan to kill him at the drop point.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle looked away.</P>
<P>Alex placed the floorboards back into position. &quot;If I fail, if he kills me, I want you to get these documents
to the police. It might save my mother and brother.&quot; Alex removed the silver bracelet from her wrist, pointing
out the small key that opened the safe. She put the bracelet on Danielle wrist and tightened the clasp.</P>
<P>Alex made eye contact and held it to be sure Danielle understood. &quot;Don’t give the evidence to the police
unless I’m dead.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle nodded and held her tight. Alex put a lot of faith in her showing her this. She would not let her down.
But somehow, she had to talk her out of killing Julian, there had to be another way to free her. She had to find
an alternate plan.</P>
<P>Alex interrupted her concentration. &quot;I have a number of details to see to before tomorrow night.&quot;
She explained.</P>
<P>&quot;Can I help?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex was touched by her lover’s devotion. &quot;You already have. But this will be easier for me, if I do it
alone.&quot; Danielle looked concerned.</P>
<P>She tried to console her. &quot;I don’t expect any trouble.&quot; She tucked a loose strand of blonde hair behind
Danielle’s ear. &quot;Just knowing your safe and waiting for me, is help enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay then, I’ll wait.&quot; Danielle was determined to be supportive. &quot;When will I see you again?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It will be at least a couple of days. I’ll come to you as soon as I can.&quot; Danielle looked troubled.</P>
<P>&quot;I’ll get this over with as soon as possible. You won’t even have time to miss me.&quot;</P>
<P>The young woman released a heavy breath. &quot;I doubt that very much.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled. &quot;There <B>is</B> something you can do for me.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle looked up hopefully. Alex took her hand lovingly and pulled her up onto the bed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Alex pulled into the lot and looked up at Danielle’s window. She could see her talking on the phone and smiled
at her animated gestures. She was dressed in a green satin robe that Alex hadn’t seen before. Danielle hung up
and dug a spoon into a pint container of ice cream. Alex watched intently as the spoon slipped past her lover’s
lips.</P>
<P>She took a deep breath. The sight of her lover excited her. She picked up her cell phone and punched in Danielle’s
number. She felt a chill as she watched the young woman lick the spoon clean and pick up the receiver.</P>
<P>&quot;Hello&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mmm, hi.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle exhaled in relief. She had been nervously awaiting word from Alex’s all evening. &quot;Are you all
right? Did everything go okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Just fine. I’m finished with my business and I thought maybe we could get together.&quot; She watched
a beautiful smile spread across her lover’s face.</P>
<P>&quot;I would like that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have a beautiful smile, by the way, and green is definitely your color.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How do you...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have my ways.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle stepped up to the window and peered out. Alex was leaning on the car gazing up at her.</P>
<P>&quot;How long have you been watching me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not nearly long enough.&quot; Alex winked. &quot;Can I come up?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle paused and looked thoughtful. &quot;Hmm … I don’t know.&quot; She looked playfully at Alex.</P>
<P>&quot;Please... let me in.&quot; Alex purred, going along with the game.</P>
<P>&quot;And since when did a locked door ever stop you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ahh... That was the old Alex. I’ve found love and given up my wicked ways.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hope not all your wicked ways.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never.&quot; Alex smiled. &quot;I’m coming up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait… tonight I call the shots.&quot; She smiled seductively, sending a chill down Alex’s back. &quot;Agreed?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex froze momentarily, then nodded. Her legs felt rubbery as she climbed last of the stairs that separated
them.</P>
<P>When she got to the top, Danielle was standing with the door open. She pulled Alex in and pushed her against
the closed door, locking her mouth to Alex’s. The kiss was slow and sensual, leaving the older woman breathless.</P>
<P>&quot;I guess you really did miss me.&quot; Alex smiled.</P>
<P>Danielle nuzzled her lips against the hollow of her neck. &quot;Terribly.&quot;</P>
<P>She touched her tongue against warm flesh and tasted her lover’s skin. &quot;I’ve wanted you all day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now that you have me what do you intend to do with me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You’ll know soon enough.&quot; Danielle promised.</P>
<P>She could see the dark outline of Alex’s nipples through her light blouse. Her fingers worked methodically at
the buttons until her lover’s breasts were fully exposed. Alex’s erect nipples betrayed her arousal. The points
stood up, begging to be touched. Danielle slid the blouse over the swell of her muscled shoulders and let it fall
to the floor.</P>
<P>Without hesitating, she dropped to her knees and slowly unzipped her pants. She could feel Alex’s heat without
touching her skin and smiled. Alex wasn’t wearing underpants. Danielle kissed the dark patch of curly hair in appreciation.
She watched as the muscles of Alex’s abdomen contracted, releasing the delicious scent of her lover. Danielle’s
senses filled. Without hesitation the tip of her tongue darted between Alex’s outer lips, sampling the wetness
that coated her sex.</P>
<P>Alex nervously pulled Danielle to her feet.</P>
<P>&quot;Now you.&quot; She tugged at the tie of her robe and watched hungrily as it fell open.</P>
<P>Alex slowly pulled the belt from the loops of the robe. She snapped the material and smiled wickedly.</P>
<P>&quot;Once a thief, always a thief.&quot; She teased.</P>
<P>Alex draped the tie across Danielle’s wrists and raised a questioning brow. Danielle’s pulse quickened. The
temptation to submit to her lover was strong, but she had different plans for Alex. This would have to wait for
another night. Danielle freed her hands and shook her head. &quot;Not this time.&quot; She winked showing her interest
in the idea. &quot;You promised I would be in control. Have you forgotten?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s mouth went dry.</P>
<P>Danielle stretched the tie in front of her, gauging her reaction. Alex’s eyes darted anxiously, reminding her
of a caged lioness. She dropped the tie. Alex’s relief was apparent. Danielle guided the strong hands to her bare
hips. The moment Alex came in contact with the young woman’s flesh her body relaxed. She ran her fingers up Danielle’s
slides and quickly relieved her of her robe. &quot;Come.&quot; Danielle whispered. She took Alex’s hand in hers
and led her into the bedroom.</P>
<P>Danielle immediately took control, directing her down onto the bed. She urged Alex to slide back until her lower
back was leaning against the headboard. Danielle hands gently spread Alex’s legs and she kneeled between them.
&quot;Do you trust me?&quot; Danielle asked. Alex met her gaze and nodded. Danielle leaned in and breathed hotly
against Alex’s ear. &quot;No more barriers between us.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s chest tightened. She wanted to give Danielle her very soul, the young woman deserved nothing less, but
she was afraid she couldn’t. In the back of her mind there was Julian, taunting, a continual reminder of her murderous
past and misplaced trust. She wasn’t sure if she was capable of letting her guard down fully.</P>
<P>&quot;Surrender to me.&quot; Danielle breathed.</P>
<P>She was asking her to relinquish control, to trust her completely. Alex couldn’t speak, the words were trapped
deep inside.</P>
<P>The young woman read the reluctance in her eyes. She held Alex’s face in her hands. &quot;You think he owns
you, that you have to destroy him to be free. But you’re ruled by your heart, Alex and he doesn’t own that…<B>
I do</B>. And tonight, I’m going to prove it. After tonight, you will always remember.&quot; She stared possessively
into the vivid blue before her.</P>
<P>Alex feared her heart would burst from her chest. She could not stop her body from trembling. Just as she prepared
to bolt, Danielle leaned in and lightly touched her lips. Alex’s body slowly yielded to her own need. Her lips
parted, allowing Danielle’s tongue entrance, while her own tongue urgently sought out the heat of Danielle’s mouth.
The fevered coupling was sheer bliss.</P>
<P>The younger woman sat back leaving Alex breathless. Her eyes caressed Alex as she spoke. &quot;I plan to go
very slowly.&quot; The older woman’s heart beat rapidly as Danielle guided Alex’s legs closed. &quot;No matter
what I do, where I touch you, I want you to hold back.&quot; She put her lips against Alex’s ear and straddled
her legs. &quot;Don’t climax until I tell you…&quot; A sensual smile spread across her lips. &quot;Do you understand?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex swallowed hard and nodded. In reward, Danielle ran her finger down the length of her torso stopping at
the apex of her thighs.</P>
<P>Danielle’s mouth followed at a slower pace, moving down her neck, shoulder, and arm until she reach the swell
of Alex’s breast. Her tongue circled the erect nipple several times before her mouth fell on it hungrily. She fed
on Alex’s nipple as if it were her body, and not her soul, that required nourishment. The insistent pulling flooded
Alex’s entire being with heat. She arched into the exquisite contact, her breathing hoarse and needy.</P>
<P>Once again Danielle pulled back. Alex’s pleading expression revealed how desperately she wanted her young lover
to continue. Danielle smiled and reached into the ice bucket on the night table, grasping a piece in her fingers.
Alex watched it glisten in the dim light. She was transfixed. The slick cube lightly grazed her skin just below
the hollow of her throat, causing Alex to tremble with excitement.</P>
<P>The young woman’s tongue followed behind the cool ice, burning a trail. The contrasting temperatures brought
every nerve in Alex’s body to life. She moaned at the incredible sensation. Danielle took her time as promised,
tracing the curves of her breasts, moving torturously slow down her torso.</P>
<P>Alex was keenly aware of the wetness building between her legs as Danielle neared the place she needed her most.
As if in worship, Danielle kissed her lover’s mound. Alex attempted to spread her legs in offering, but Danielle’s
knees proved to be an immovable barrier. A frustrated cry escaped Alex’s lips.</P>
<P>&quot;Easy...&quot; Danielle soothed, her fingers caressing the moist curly hairs.</P>
<P>Alex groaned and forced her legs to relax.</P>
<P>&quot;We have all… night... long.&quot; Danielle whispered slowly. Alex inhaled sharply, not nearly as confident
in her restraint as her young lover.</P>
<P>Danielle sat back on her heels and picked up another piece of ice. Alex watched mesmerized as the ice succumbed
to her young lover’s heated skin, droplets streamed down Danielle’s fingers, dripping onto her stomach.</P>
<P>Alex felt a wave of dizziness as she realized that, like the ice, she too was melting under her lover’s touch.
Danielle slowly reached for the something on the night table. When her hand came back into view, she held a long
thin needle. She searched her lover’s eyes for her reaction, ready to abandon her plan at the slightest hesitation.
Alex swallowed hard and nodded.</P>
<P>Danielle slowly circled her lover’s erect nipple with the ice. Alex’s shoulders snapped back, causing her breasts
to jut forward, her nipples stood up provocatively. Danielle smiled and lovingly circled the hard point several
times in succession. Alex shivered more from anticipation than cold. The knowledge of what her lover intended to
do stimulated her beyond reason.</P>
<P>&quot;Hold on to the headboard.&quot; Alex obeyed immediately, her arms stretched out low to either side.</P>
<P>Danielle, set the ice aside and cradled her lovers right breast in her hand. Slowly she tightened her grip.
&quot;Be very still.&quot;</P>
<P>With loving care and delicate precision, she passed the sharp needle through the numbed nipple. Alex was conscious
only of her lover’s warm hand and a dull pressure. The sight of the needle penetrating the her erect flesh caused
her head to swim with excitement.</P>
<P>Danielle reached for the small gold loop on the night table. She removed the tiny bead, opening the ring. With
loving care, she threaded it through her lover’s nipple. She used a soft cloth to wipe away two of the three small
drops of blood from Alex’s breast. The last she collected on the end of her finger. Alex quivered with desire as
she watched her lover slowly lick the droplet with the tip of her tongue.</P>
<P>Danielle re-attached the bead to the ring, pausing to admire her work. Her eyes sparkled with approval.</P>
<P>&quot;So perfect.&quot; Danielle smiled.</P>
<P>She lifted Alex’s breast, causing the ring to shift slightly. Alex bit back a moan. &quot;Yes… when it moves...
when it tugs... when you feel your clothes rub against it, you’ll think of me.&quot; She squeezed gently. &quot;You’re
mine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes...&quot; Alex hissed as her mouth closed hungrily on Danielle’s. Her hands slid through Danielle’s
hair and pulled her in. The need in her kiss revealed her desperate hunger. Danielle gently pushed her back. Alex
groaned.</P>
<P>&quot;On your knees.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s mind reeled as it processed the request. With little hesitation she complied, her body thrumming with
anticipation as she turned and faced the wall.</P>
<P>&quot;Place your hands on the headboard.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex reached forward with trembling fingers, grateful for something solid to hold on to. She tightly gripped
the low brass headboard. The metal felt cool against her fevered skin.</P>
<P>&quot;That’s right... back up... just a little more... stretch your arms out... yes...that’s it.</P>
<P>The change in position caused the flow of blood to quickly circulate to her breasts, bringing a rush of warmth
to the tender flesh. The cool numbing effect of the ice slowly faded and her nipple to began to throb with sensation,
echoing the pulsing between her legs.</P>
<P>She kneeled, her arms outstretched, her nipples less than an inch from the bed. Each time she exhaled the small
nipple ring brushed lightly against the sheets, sending a riot of sensation through her. She fought the urge to
roll over and take control. With complete disregard for modesty, she rolled her hips in a silent plea to end her
longing.</P>
<P>Danielle moved behind and slight to the left. She slowly ran her hand down Alex’s straining torso, and over
her firm bottom, stopping just short of her sex. Alex spread her legs and moaned as her sensitive nipple rubbed
against the sheet. Danielle wrapped her right arm around Alex’s waist holding her in place and playfully squeezed
the neglected left nipple with her other hand.</P>
<P>Gradually Danielle released her and let the fingers seek out the source of Alex’s heat. They slid teasingly
across her opening, slowly circling her entrance. Alex cried out. She was wet, open and empty… raw with need. The
urge to rock her hips back was overwhelming, but the headboard anchored her in place. It was impossible to push
back on her lover’s questing fingers without letting go.</P>
<P>As if in answer to her silent prayer, Danielle pressed two fingers a scant few millimeters past her entrance
and paused, watching Alex twitch with anticipation. She smiled and pushed in a little farther, then paused again.
Alex shuddered. Her young lover had been paying attention. Danielle pushed just a bit deeper, wriggling her fingers.</P>
<P>&quot;I want every inch of you.&quot; Danielle whispered hotly.</P>
<P>Alex groaned and threw her head back, teeth clenched. She managed to keep from crying out by expelling her breath
in a deep hiss. The sharp exhale caused the nipple ring to graze the sheets, harder this time. She gasped as her
aroused nipple tightened around the small ring. It sent a rush of heat to her very core.</P>
<P>Danielle’s fingers continued their slow progression inside her, until at last she was completely filled. Alex
moaned, her pleasure was so acute.</P>
<P>It was a wonderful sound, the purest reflection of the ecstasy she felt. Danielle’s left hand pressed against
Alex’s lower abdomen, where she felt her own fingers moving inside her lover.</P>
<P>Slowly she brought them to a stop. Alex’s eyes clouded in an erotic haze, her lips forming one word, 'please.'</P>
<P>Although Danielle had neither seen nor heard her plea, she was keenly aware of her lover’s need and placed two
fingers on Alex’s swollen clit, gliding through her wetness. At the same time she began slowly pumping inside,
taking nearly a full breath to push in completely then retreat. She massaged Alex’s clit with a slow back and forth
motion in perfect rhythm with her thrusts.</P>
<P>&quot;Ohhh, god Danielle I...I can’t...&quot; Alex was on the brink of release.</P>
<P>&quot;Just a little longer… for me.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex took long shuddering breath.</P>
<P>&quot;That’s it .... yes... hold back.&quot; Danielle’s voice was like a tender caress and Alex strained to
obey. She tried inching forward to escape the relentless fingers teasing her clit, but Danielle leaned in, never
ceasing her gentle stroking.</P>
<P>Alex’s breaths came in rapid pants. She was going to come.</P>
<P>Danielle sensed it and lifted her fingers from her throbbing clit, yet never ceased her rhythmic thrusts. They
continued, relentlessly, penetrating Alex’s very depths. Danielle leaned toward her lover’s ear. Her breasts rubbing
sensually against Alex’s back. &quot;You can sustain this arousal for a long time.&quot; She teased. Alex’s hands
nearly left the headboard as her own words returned to haunt her.</P>
<P>She tried to ignore the friction of her lover’s fingers plunging inside her slow and steady. It was impossible.
Her clit continued to pulse, as if reliving Danielle’s gentle caress.</P>
<P>When again, Alex thought she could no longer hold back, Danielle changed her tactics, confusing her senses.
Her fingers played with her left nipple, firmly pinching it again… and again… and again. Alex’s moaned as she realized
this action too, was meant to match her lover’s thrusts.</P>
<P>She tried to concentrated on the short bursts of pain assaulting her nipple and the wonderful tingling sensation
that radiated through her breast, but the movement of Danielle’s fingers deep inside her refused to be ignored.
The tips of her lover’s fingers curled slightly, creating an exquisite new pressure.</P>
<P>Alex groaned as Danielle’s hand moved from her breast. Now, her lover’s mouth pressed against her neck adding
a new torment. She began drawing hard against the tender skin there. Alex’s arms shook and her shoulders strained
as Danielle pressed her weight into her lover’s back, leaning into her. Alex’s body was awash with sensation. She
couldn’t escape it. Nothing could distract her from the release building inside her.</P>
<P>At that moment Danielle knew Alex was hers. She eased her weight back and ground her pelvis against Alex’s bottom
nudging her forward. This small concession freed Alex’s hips to move back and forth, swallowing her lover’s fingers.
She groaned in gratitude.</P>
<P>The fingers of Danielle’s left hand once again found Alex’s clit and resumed their relentless stroking. Alex’s
entire body stiffened in a final attempt to hold back.</P>
<P>&quot;Come for me.&quot; Danielle purred.</P>
<P>Alex nearly sobbed in relief. She groaned and pushed her hips back, forcing Danielle’s fingers deep inside.
Danielle met her thrust for thrust as her fingers massaged her swollen clit. With every movement, Alex felt Danielle’s
energy pass into her, accumulating in her core, until the pleasure overwhelmed her and she had to let go.</P>
<P>&quot;Now.&quot; Danielle urged. &quot;Let go!&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s hips froze in ecstasy as she came in a series of jarring explosions. She shook helplessly as spasms racked
her body and braced against her young lover as currents of pleasure coursed through her. Danielle never stopped.
She drew out the climax with gentle caresses until Alex cried out, giving in to her lover completely. As the spasms
subsided, Alex collapsed, weakened by the force of her climax.</P>
<P>Every few minutes her body would tremble, remembering release.</P>
<P>It was redemption. The power of Danielle’s love, her utter devotion, mended her soul. Alex held her tightly
as her breathing returned to normal. Her cheeks were wet with tears. &quot;You... only you…&quot; Alex promised.
Encircled in the glow of Danielle’s love she drifted, exhausted into slumber.</P>
<P>Danielle remained awake, formulating a desperate plan. No one would separate them ever again.</P>
