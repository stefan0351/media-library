<!-- Accidental Love \ Part 10 -->

<p>Susan had hold of Timmy and Jack was holding Ricky as the two boys hurled insults at
			each other. "You cheated."</p>
		<p>"Did not!"</p>
		<p>"Did so!"</p>
		<p>"Did not!"</p>
		<p>"Enough!" Ronnie's voice boomed over the squawking. "I don't care who
			cheated or who's turn it was. If you two can't play nice I'm going to shut it off."
			The threat had not stopped the two brothers from bickering again and again.</p>
		<p>"But he started it."</p>
		<p>"Timothy!" Both his parents yelled.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie." Rose leaned on her crutches. "Your mother is on the
			phone." As the tall woman passed her, she spoke in a lower voice. "She sounds
			like she's been crying." That caused the dark-haired woman to hesitate for a second
			before picking up the phone. A crying parent never meant anything good.</p>
		<p>"Mother? Mo-?Mother?Mother, stop crying. I can't understand you."
			She silently motioned for Rose to get Susan. "Okay, tell me again, slowly." The
			redhead entered the kitchen just as Ronnie was piecing together what her hysterical mother
			was trying to tell her. "Are they sure? Okay, okay Mother, slow down?what did he
			say?" She turned her back to the other woman and leaned against the island.
			"Mother, listen carefully to me. Did he say for sure that it was Tommy?" At the
			mention of her brother's name, Susan's hand went to her mouth.</p>
		<p>"Did something happen?"</p>
		<p>"Who called you?" Ronnie asked as she waved her sister away. She had enough
			to do trying to understand what Beatrice was telling her. "No, Susan's here. We'll
			stop by and pick you up. Yes Mother, we'll be there in fifteen minutes. No. Don't call
			anyone else. If they need to be called, I'll do it later. No, don't call a cab. We'll be
			right there. Yes, I promise?bye." She pressed the off button and set the phone
			down on the counter.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?" Susan took a step forward. "Did something happen to
			Tommy?" There was no response. "Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Tommy?" Her back to them, she gripped the edge of the island. "He
			was going eastbound in the westbound lane of the Thruway."</p>
		<p>"Oh my God," Rose whispered. Ronnie pushed herself to a standing position and
			faced them.</p>
		<p>"Rose, I need you to watch the boys until we get back. I'm sure they'll just eat
			pizza and play video games."</p>
		<p>"Of course," the young woman replied. "Anything. You know that."</p>
		<p>"I'll get Jack and our coats," Susan said, her voice shaky. She left the room
			to get her husband. Rose hobbled over to her tall companion. For several seconds, neither
			spoke. Finally Ronnie broke the silence.</p>
		<p>"I don't know how late we'll be. Try to put them to bed by ten. There are plenty
			of rooms for them to choose from."</p>
		<p>"I'll take care of it," Rose promised. She reached up and cupped the older
			woman's cheek. "I love you."</p>
		<p>Ronnie gave a shiny-eyed smile. "How do you know just what to say?" She
			pulled her love close and kissed the top of her head. "I love you too, Rose. Don't
			kill the kids or play any game that involves tying you up, okay?"</p>
		<p>"I think I can handle them. You have more important things to worry about."
			She felt Ronnie step back and realized Jack and Susan had entered the room.</p>
		<p>"I'll call you as soon as I know anything."</p>
		<p>"They can't have any caffeine or sugar after seven. John has to be in bed by eight
			and the other boys can stay up until ten." Susan said as she rifled through her
			pocketbook. "I can't find the keys. Jack, where are the keys?" Her lower lip
			quivered and her hands began to shake.</p>
		<p>"I'm driving," Ronnie said firmly, snatching the keys from her sister. The
			change in her tone caused Rose to look at her. Where soft curves accented the strong jaw,
			taut muscles clenched just beneath the surface. Ronnie's back was straight, her stance
			commanding. Gone was the soft, sensitive woman Rose was privy to. In her stead was the
			executive, the leader of a multi-million dollar company and head of a powerful family.
			Although she understood the need for the two identities, Rose still wished desperately
			that Ronnie did not have to be the caretaker all the time. She hated the way the pressure
			and strain drained the energy out of her beloved. Watching them leave, Rose could only
			pray that everything would be all right.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>The chime of the clock woke the dozing woman. Rose reached for her crutches and stood
			up. A quick rubbing of her eyes helped her see that it was three o'clock. There had been
			no phone call yet, not a word. She went out to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee. No
			doubt when Ronnie returned she would want some. Soon Rose was smiling at the peaceful
			sound of the coffee maker. Ricky and Timmy had decided to continue their fight, forcing
			Rose at one point to send them to separate corners to cool off. That action earned her a
			colorful string of words from Ricky. Only the threat of repeating them to his Aunt Ronnie
			managed to quiet him down. At bedtime she took the easy way out and let each boy pick his
			own room to sleep in. Her arms still ached from working her way up the stairs twice before
			Ronnie's nephews finally fell asleep.</p>
		<p>Rose passed the time by drinking coffee at the kitchen table and rereading the daily
			paper. Tabitha popped in from time to time, demanded attention, then left. Three days
			worth of newsprint and half the pot of coffee slipped by before Ronnie's Jeep pulled into
			the driveway. She got up on her crutches and went to the door, opening it in time to see
			Jack helping his wife and mother-in-law out of the vehicle. "Oh Lord," she
			whispered, knowing the worst had happened. Ronnie took over for her brother-in-law and
			helped Beatrice inside. "What rooms did you put the boys in?" she asked as she
			passed.</p>
		<p>"The rooms on either side of yours and the one at the end of the hall," Rose
			said, choking back a lump in her own throat. Until she saw the crushed look on their
			faces, she had been holding on to the hope that Tommy had somehow survived the accident.
			Ronnie nodded and looked at Jack.</p>
		<p>"The room on the left near the end of the hall is empty. Put her there. I'll put
			Mother in my room." She took the matriarch's pocketbook and set it on the counter.
			"Mother? Come on, I think you need to lie down for a little while."</p>
		<p>"But I have to call?"</p>
		<p>"I'll take care of letting everyone know. You need to lie down." She saw Jack
			leading his wife out of the room. "Come on, we're going upstairs now."</p>
		<p>"Horrible?it's just so horrible?" Beatrice cried.</p>
		<p>"I know, Mother. Come on now." Ronnie led the grieving woman away.</p>
		<p>Fifteen minutes later she returned to the kitchen. "Rose, do you think you can
			make a pot of coffee?"</p>
		<p>"I already did. Your cup is on the table." Ronnie looked at the familiar mug,
			then at her companion. "I figured you'd need some coffee," Rose said with a
			shrug. "I've had a bit myself." They both looked over at the nearly empty pot.</p>
		<p>"That was good thinking." She rubbed her eyes. "What time is it
			anyway?"</p>
		<p>"Almost six-thirty."</p>
		<p>"I guess I should wait an hour or so before I start calling everyone." Ronnie
			wrapped her hands around her mug and stared at the beige liquid. Uncertain what to say,
			Rose remained silent, giving her companion the time she needed. Blue eyes shone with
			unshed tears but remained focused on the coffee. After an extended silence, Ronnie began
			to speak. "The witnesses said he turned into the off ramp instead of the on
			ramp." Her lower lip quivered and she blinked rapidly. "He was picking up speed
			and hit a dump truck just before the entrance to the highway."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, I'm so sorry." She put her hand on the strong forearm.</p>
		<p>"They um?" The blinking increased as she battled to keep the tears in.
			"They have to do an autopsy." Her voice hitched. "They think he
			might?the drugs?" A sob escaped her lips and Ronnie found herself being
			pulled into Rose's arms.</p>
		<p>"Okay, I've got you," the young woman cooed. The chairs scraped across the
			kitchen floor as they moved closer, neither wanting to break the contact. The caretaker
			needed comfort and Rose was the only one who could provide it.</p>
		<p>"I-it isn't fair. He's too young," Ronnie choked. "The drugs?"</p>
		<p>"I know." She kissed the dark forehead. "I know." She began rocking
			as hot tears soaked her shirt. Sobs racked the tall frame but Rose held on, murmuring
			comforting words and gently rubbing Ronnie's back. "I've got you?that's right,
			let it go."</p>
		<p>"It was those damn drugs," she cried.</p>
		<p>"I know." Rose continued rocking and holding her beloved until finally the
			tears subsided and the sobs reduced themselves to sniffles. She felt Ronnie pull back and
			released her embrace. "Better?" She received a shaky nod. "Come here."
			She took a linen napkin off the table and wiped the wet face. "Blow?that's
			better."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, I just needed?well, that." Ronnie wearily sank back into her
			chair and shook her head. "This is just so hard to believe." There was nothing
			Rose could say so she scooted her chair over until their knees were touching. Ronnie laid
			her hand atop the smaller one and squeezed. "The next few days are going to be
			rough."</p>
		<p>"You don't have to go through this alone." Rose brought her free hand up and
			cupped her love's cheek. "I'll be right here with you, I promise." She looked at
			the clock. "It's still too early to call everyone and you really need some rest.
			You've been up all night."</p>
		<p>"What about you?" For the first time Ronnie noticed the dark circles under
			the beautiful green eyes. "Did you sleep at all?"</p>
		<p>"I dropped off sometime around two but I was up by three."</p>
		<p>"We both need some sleep." She stood up, then frowned. "I have to take
			the couch. If someone wakes up?" There was no need to finish the sentence.</p>
		<p>"Why don't I take the couch? You need the comfortable bed more than I do."</p>
		<p>"I'm too tired to argue with you Rose. "</p>
		<p>"Then don't," the young woman said firmly. Ronnie looked at her and wondered
			if anyone else would be able to speak to her in that manner and get away with it. She
			suspected not, except perhaps Maria. Her eyes saddened at the thought of breaking the news
			to the housekeeper who had known Tommy since he was a baby.</p>
		<p>"There is so much to do. I have to call the cousins?"</p>
		<p>"You can do all that after you've had a couple hours rest." Rose forced
			herself up on her crutches. "Come on now, I'll lie with you until you fall
			asleep." Ronnie nodded wearily. She needed to rest and there was no doubt that with
			her blonde friend by her side she would be able to do just that.</p>
		<p>After going to the bathroom and changing into her sweats, Ronnie crawled into bed.
			"You sure you won't fall asleep?" she mumbled groggily while arranging her
			pillows.</p>
		<p>"No, I've had so much coffee I don't think I'll be able to sleep." Rose held
			her arm out. "Come here, let me hold you." Soon Ronnie was nestled against her
			chest. "That's right," she began stroking the long black hair. "You rest
			and let me worry about you for a change."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Rose was humming softly and gently rubbing her sleeping companion's back when she heard
			the car pull into the driveway. Her eyes closed slowly with the realization that it was
			now Monday and in less than a minute Maria was going to walk through the door, completely
			unaware of the previous evening's events. She looked over at Ronnie and knew she could not
			wake her for this. "I'll take care of it," she whispered before slipping out
			from under and placing a gentle kiss on the sleeping woman's shoulder.</p>
		<p>She entered the kitchen just as Maria was closing the sliding glass door. "Oooh,
			that wind," the housekeeper said as she removed her coat. She turned and realized she
			was not alone. "Oh, good morning, Rose. Is that Susan's car in the driveway?" At
			that same moment she noticed the half-empty coffeepot and the newspapers strewn about the
			table.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Rose, what's going on? Where's Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"She's sleeping. Maria, please come sit down." Rose leaned her crutches
			against the island and pulled out a chair.</p>
		<p>"Why is Susan here? Are the boys all right? Did something happen to Jack?
			Is?"</p>
		<p>"No, they're fine. Please sit down." Rose let out a breath and waited for the
			housekeeper to take a seat before sitting down herself.</p>
		<p>"You're scaring me. What happened?" Maria's voice was full of worry. Rose
			felt her throat tighten even before she spoke. "I wish there was an easy way to tell
			you this." Realizing her words were only making the older woman more upset, she took
			a deep breath and continued. "Tommy was killed in an auto accident last night."</p>
		<p>Like a mirror shattering, Maria's face lost all composure and she broke down into
			tears. As she did with Ronnie, Rose took the grieving woman in her arms and comforted her.
			The housekeeper allowed the contact for a few minutes before standing up and wiping her
			eyes. "Well then, I believe there are things I should be doing." She walked over
			to the coffee maker. "I'm sure a fresh pot would be in order."</p>
		<p>"Maria, you don't have to do that."</p>
		<p>The older woman turned and looked at her. "Rose, I am not a Cartwright. Ronnie
			says I'm the housekeeper but that does not make me family. I remember when her father
			passed away. I worked for that man for twenty-five years and on the day of his funeral I
			was here making sure there was enough food for the people who were going to be arriving
			after the graveside service."</p>
		<p>"That's awful," Rose gasped. "Ronnie wouldn't give you the day
			off?"</p>
		<p>"Ronnie wasn't in charge then, her mother was." Maria poured the coffee into
			the sink and turned on the faucet. "She said she needed me here to take care of
			everything for her. What was I supposed to do?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sure Ronnie won't expect you to work." She hobbled forward another step
			and spoke in a lower voice. "Beatrice is here too."</p>
		<p>"Well then, she'll be expecting hot tea when she comes down." Maria opened
			the cupboard and fished out the teapot. "What time are you going to wake Ronnie
			up?"</p>
		<p>"I figured I'd give her another half-hour or so. She was up all night."</p>
		<p>"Hmm, Beatrice usually wakes up by eight. You probably should wake Ronnie once the
			coffee is ready." Rose nodded in agreement. It would not be a good thing to wake her
			companion up and then make her face her mother immediately.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Maria followed Rose into the room and set the steaming cup of coffee on the nightstand.
			"I'll start breakfast for the boys. I'm sure they'll be up soon."</p>
		<p>"Thank you. We will be out in a few minutes," she said, her eyes never
			leaving the sleeping woman. Once she heard the click of the door closing, Rose leaned her
			crutches against the wall and laid down next to her companion. She propped herself up on
			one elbow and looked down, silently wishing she did not have to wake Ronnie. Even in sleep
			the executive's face showed the signs of grief. Closed eyes still showed the puffiness of
			crying and there was no peacefulness in the chiseled features. "Ronnie? Time to wake
			up, Hon."</p>
		<p>"Hmm?" Eyes that did not get enough sleep opened with momentary confusion.
			"What time is it?"</p>
		<p>"About quarter of eight," the young woman replied. Ronnie groaned and sat up.</p>
		<p>"I guess I'd better get up then. I have a busy day ahead of me." Her eyes
			widened at the sight of her coffee being handed to her. "Oh, thanks." She took a
			sip and smiled appreciatively. "I needed this." She took another sip, then
			looked at Rose quizzically. "Did you make this?"</p>
		<p>"Maria did."</p>
		<p>"Oh God, Maria." Ronnie put her hand to her mouth. "I have
			to?"</p>
		<p>"I took care of it for you," Rose said in a low tone, her eyes betraying just
			how difficult it had been for her to be the bearer of bad news.</p>
		<p>"Come here." The tall woman leaned her back against the headrest and held her
			right arm out.</p>
		<p>"But you have things to do," she said, although there was nothing more in the
			world she wanted to do at that moment than curl up in Ronnie's arms.</p>
		<p>"I can spare a minute." Sad blue eyes looked at Rose. "I really need to
			hold you." Careful not to spill the coffee, they snuggled up together, the blonde
			head resting against the executive's chest. "Thank you."</p>
		<p>"If there is anything I can do?"</p>
		<p>"You're doing it right now," Ronnie said, pressing her lips against Rose's
			head. "I just need a few minutes of peace with you before I go out there and face
			anyone." She took another sip of coffee and began idly stroking the honey hair.
			"There are going to be hundreds of people going in and out for the next few days.
			Tabitha will be spending a lot of time in the laundry room." She nuzzled her cheek
			against the soft hair then took another drink. "If Jack and Susan stay, would you
			help keep the boys occupied? They like playing video games with you."</p>
		<p>"Of course, Ronnie. Anything you need." As much as she didn't want to, Rose
			pulled away from the embrace. "I had better go back out there and see if Maria needs
			any help. Besides, I'm sure you want to get dressed before everyone wakes up."</p>
		<p>"Maria? She didn't go home?"</p>
		<p>"No, she's making breakfast."</p>
		<p>"Tell her she can go home. She doesn't have to work today." Ronnie was
			surprised to receive a quick hug. "What was that for?"</p>
		<p>"I knew you wouldn't make her work."</p>
		<p>"Of course not. How could I expect her to work after this?"</p>
		<p>"Your mother did when your father died." She watched Ronnie's jaw tense.</p>
		<p>"I'm not like my mother," she said tersely. She flung the covers back and
			stood up. "Rose, would you mind telling Maria?"</p>
		<p>"No, I don't mind at all," the young woman said just before Ronnie closed the
			bathroom door. She picked up the empty mug. "I'll have fresh coffee waiting for you
			when you come out." It was easier said then done as Rose tried to figure out how to
			maneuver with her crutches. The solution was to hold the handle by her teeth, which earned
			her a disapproving look from Maria as she entered the kitchen.</p>
		<p>"You are as stubborn as she is, aren't you?" the housekeeper chastised as she
			took the mug. "You know I would have come and picked it up. You didn't need to carry
			it all the way out here."</p>
		<p>"Maria, Ronnie said you didn't have to stay today. I'm sure we can handle
			everything."</p>
		<p>"Was that her idea or yours?"</p>
		<p>"Hers."</p>
		<p>"I see." The housekeeper nodded. "I would expect that from someone as
			generous as Ronnie. However, I think I should stay."</p>
		<p>"Why? You're just as upset as everyone else, why should you stay and work?"</p>
		<p>"Maria? Maria are you down there?" Beatrice called down from the top of the
			stairs.</p>
		<p>"That's why," the older woman said. She walked out to the living room and
			looked up at the matriarch. "There's tea waiting for you, Mrs. Cartwright."</p>
		<p>"Oh good, you are here." Beatrice walked down the stairs, her face showing
			the signs of a grieving mother. "It's terrible, isn't it? Just simply terrible."</p>
		<p>"Tragic," the housekeeper agreed.</p>
		<p>"Where's my daughter?" She finally noticed Rose leaning on her crutches.
			"Hello, dear. Aren't you Ronnie's little friend? The one that was in the
			wheelchair?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, Ma'am. My name is Rose."</p>
		<p>"Rose, where's Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"She's getting dressed. She'll be out in a minute."</p>
		<p>"Has she started to call anyone yet?"</p>
		<p>"I'll be doing it in a minute," Ronnie said as she exited Rose's room. She
			appeared composed but Rose knew it was an act. The puffy eyes told of new tears of grief
			waiting to pour out. "Good morning, Mother."</p>
		<p>"There's nothing good about this day, Veronica. You'd better get started. Call
			your Aunt Elaine first." The matriarch strode into the kitchen, effectively
			dismissing her daughter.</p>
		<p>"I guess I'd better start making some phone calls." She looked in the
			direction of the kitchen and shook her head. "I'm going to use the phone in the
			office. Excuse me."</p>
		<p>Rose waited until the door to the room closed before speaking to Maria in hushed tones.
			"Why was she so mean to Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"She's not trying to be mean," the housekeeper explained. "Beatrice has
			a certain way of handling things. This is her way."</p>
		<p>"I know she's hurting but so is Ronnie. Can't she see that?"</p>
		<p>"Some people can't see past their own pain, Rose." Maria looked at the
			kitchen. "I have to get in there."</p>
		<p>Rose stood there for a moment, her first instinct was to keep Ronnie company but then
			she realized there was a better way to help her friend. Steeling herself, she followed
			Maria into the kitchen.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Beatrice was sitting at the table with a cup of tea in one hand and a handkerchief in
			the other. "Mrs. Cartwright, would you mind if I sat down here?" Rose asked
			sweetly. "I still can't stand for any length of time yet."</p>
		<p>"Well yes, sit down. Maria, some more tea."</p>
		<p>"Thank you," the young woman said as she took a seat. The housekeeper
			approached with the teapot and a cup of coffee for Rose. They exchanged glances but said
			nothing. Beatrice looked at her watch.</p>
		<p>"I would think Ricky would be up by now. He's always an early riser."</p>
		<p>"He was up late. I had trouble getting him to sleep."</p>
		<p>"That's right, you watched them, didn't you?" Rose nodded. The matriarch
			sipped her tea. "That Ricky. He's a lot like Tommy, you know."</p>
		<p>"I'm afraid I didn't get to know your son. Why don't you tell me about him?"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ronnie stepped into the kitchen an hour later looking for her coffee. Her throat was
			becoming dry after making so many calls. An eyebrow arched at the sight of her mother,
			Rose, and Susan sitting at the table chatting. Since Beatrice's back was to her, Ronnie
			hoped she could sneak in, get her coffee, and get out. The sound of her sister's voice,
			however, dashed that hope. "Ronnie."</p>
		<p>"Morning Susan." She turned and faced the table. "Mother, Frank and the
			kids will be here in a little while. Most of the others will be here this afternoon."</p>
		<p>"Did you make the arrangements? I want you to make sure that he gets the best, the
			very best."</p>
		<p>"I'll take care of it," Ronnie said. "I have a few more calls to make.
			Laura can handle the business associates and the press releases." Maria handed her
			the mug. "I'll be back out later."</p>
		<p>"Did you reach your Aunt Elaine?"</p>
		<p>"I got her answering service. She'll call back."</p>
		<p>"But you're on the phone." The matriarch's voice raised a notch. "She
			won't be able to get through. Veronica, I don't want her to hear about this on the
			news."</p>
		<p>"I have call waiting, Mother. She won't get a busy signal."</p>
		<p>"She can't hear about this on the news. Tommy was her favorite nephew."</p>
		<p>"I left a message with her service."
			<i>What do you want me to do? I can't
				make her call me. </i>She gulped her coffee, wincing at the burning heat going down her
			throat.
		</p>
		<p>"Mrs. Cartwright, would you like some more tea?" Rose asked.</p>
		<p>"Not right now, dear. I should go spend some time with my grandsons." She
			looked at her younger daughter. "Susan, I assume if you and Jack have another child
			you will name him Thomas."</p>
		<p>"Mother, we've decided that three?"</p>
		<p>"Nonsense. You're certainly young enough and it's not like your figure could be
			ruined by another child. Your sister continues to show no interest in having
			children." The matriarch rose to her feet. "I'm going to go visit with the boys
			and then you can take me home, Ronnie. I'll let you know when I'm ready."</p>
		<p>The tall woman's knuckles turned white as she gripped the handle of her mug and glared
			at her mother's retreating form. Susan stood next to her sister. "She doesn't know
			what she's saying. She's just hurting over Tommy."</p>
		<p>"She knows exactly what she's saying, Sis. The problem is we keep putting up with
			it." She turned to Rose. "People are going to start arriving soon. You might
			want to go into your room before it happens."</p>
		<p>"No." She picked up her crutches. "I can help. I'll keep an eye on the
			kids so the adults can be together. I don't mind."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure?" Ronnie looked at her and was hard pressed not to seek an
			embrace.
			<i>You know how crazy it's gonna be and you still want to help? </i>She was
			certain she would not be as generous if the situations were reversed.
			<i>Then again, when
				it comes to you, there isn't anything I wouldn't do. </i>"Thank you," she said
			softly.
		</p>
		<p>"Of course. It's the least I can do." Rose smiled and Ronnie found herself
			helplessly lost in it. "Ahem." Susan's polite cough broke the moment.</p>
		<p>"I'd better get back to the phone calls."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, I'll make sure Mother gets home. You worry about getting in touch with
			everyone," the redhead said.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>It was almost nightfall by the time Susan and her family took Beatrice home. Ronnie
			made it a point to stay hidden in the office as much as possible while unbeknownst to her
			Rose was doing her best to keep the matriarch away from her. When the minivan backed out
			of her driveway, the black-haired woman breathed a sigh of relief and stepped into the
			living room.
			<i>Damn. </i>In her hiding, she had not noticed that the group of relatives
			arriving was outpacing those leaving and now close to thirty Cartwrights were floating
			around. She spotted Rose immediately and made a beeline for her. "Hi."
		</p>
		<p>"Hi. Your mother left."</p>
		<p>"I see that." She looked around, her tall frame allowing her to see past the
			mass of people. "Do you think they could be a little louder?"</p>
		<p>"Who's the one in the blue jacket with the tie undone?"</p>
		<p>"Michael. He owns a Toyota dealership. One of the cousins," Ronnie said as
			she looked at the young man, frowning at his bereavement act.</p>
		<p>"Oh."</p>
		<p>"Why do you ask?"</p>
		<p>"He was telling me that he and Tommy were close."</p>
		<p>"Yeah and he was 'close' to Dad after he died. Didn't get him anything then and it
			won't now."</p>
		<p>"You mean he's only acting like that because?" Rose stopped, thinking
			about how Delores acted when her father died. "That's terrible."</p>
		<p>"I'm surprised he's here and not ransacking Tommy's condo right now. Must have
			been so close he forgot the address in all of his grief." Hidden from the sight of
			others, a hand worked its way to the small of Ronnie's back and began rubbing in gentle
			circles.</p>
		<p>"They'll be leaving soon, won't they?"</p>
		<p>"Well, there's no reason for the them to stay. They all said their condolences to
			Mother and found out when the wake and funeral are scheduled. They're just hanging out
			here because they have no place better to be. A loud crash from the game room drew her
			attention. "I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>The crash turned out to be a barstool complete with its occupant. "Hey,
			Cuzz," the drunken man slurred. Two of the half-dozen men standing around moved in to
			help him up. A breathalyzer was not needed to know they were all quite drunk.</p>
		<p>"Frank, what are you doing."</p>
		<p>"The boys and I were just raising a few to Tommy." He wobbled back onto his
			now upright stool. She walked past him and stepped behind the bar.</p>
		<p>"A bottle of scotch and half a bottle of vodka. You guys have been toasting him
			quite well, I believe." She capped the vodka and shut the light off behind the bar.
			"I think it's time for your wives to take you home." She walked around shutting
			off lights and hanging up the cue sticks. One by one the men grumbled and left the room,
			not all unassisted. It took her slightly longer to break up the clusters of women gathered
			together talking about every imaginable subject. Only when the last relative was gone did
			Maria appear with the vacuum. "Don't bother tonight," Ronnie said.</p>
		<p>"Look at this room," the housekeeper said incredulously.</p>
		<p>"It will still be here in the morning, Maria. It's been a long day and I'm
			exhausted. Please, just leave it until tomorrow, okay?"</p>
		<p>"If you wish. I'll be here first thing as usual. Should I pick up anything special
			at the market?"</p>
		<p>"No, there's nothing--"</p>
		<p>"A roll of chocolate chip cookie dough," Rose interjected. "Um, you know
			how kids love cookies. Maybe it'll keep them occupied." She caught the slight upturn
			of a smile on Ronnie's lips and knew her idea was well received. "Better make that
			two," she amended, her eyes never leaving those of her friend.</p>
		<p>An hour later, two bodies were curled up around each other, both fighting yawns.
			"You are an incredibly thoughtful woman," Ronnie mumbled into the young woman's
			ear.</p>
		<p>"Mm?"</p>
		<p>"The cookies. And I know you put up with my mother to keep her away from me."
			She squeezed the shoulder beneath her hand. "You don't know how much I appreciate
			that."</p>
		<p>"You had enough to worry about." She squirmed back into the warm body behind
			her. The biggest advantage of having her cast shortened was that she could snuggle up as
			close as she wanted to Ronnie. "She's not that bad."</p>
		<p>"That's because she's not your mother."</p>
		<p>"True."</p>
		<p>"It's a good thing too." The hand that had been squeezing Rose's shoulder,
			moved down to her waist.</p>
		<p>"Why is that?"</p>
		<p>"Because," Ronnie answered as she flipped the smaller woman onto her back and
			put her hands on either side of the golden head of hair. She relaxed her shoulders,
			bringing their lips so close that their breath mingled. "That would make you my
			sister and I guarantee there are times when my thoughts of you are far from
			sisterly." Even in the dim moonlight Rose could see the roguish grin before it was
			replaced with a more serious face. "You don't know how much you've helped me today.
			You made me feel?well?very special."</p>
		<p>"With everything you mean to me, how could I do anything less?" She reached
			up and caressed the chiseled face above her. "And you are special. I know it's going
			to be hard dealing with your family for the next few days but I'll be right there to help
			you through it. Come on now, you're tired, I'm tired, and tomorrow is going to be another
			long day. Enough talk for tonight." Rose put her hand on Ronnie's shoulder and
			pulled, forcing the taller woman to lie down against her. "That's better."</p>
		<p>"Rose?"</p>
		<p>"Mm?"</p>
		<p>"Can I stay like this?in your arms?" The woman who usually took charge
			sounded almost like a scared child with her request. As hard as it was for Rose to hear
			Ronnie in such pain, it filled her heart to know that it was she the older woman turned to
			for comfort. "Always," she whispered, tightening her hold.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe he's gone." There was a long silence. "I know things
			have been hard between us lately but that's not what I see when I think of him."</p>
		<p>"What do you see, Ronnie?" she whispered, her hand moving to stroke the long
			hair. "Tell me about the Tommy you grew up with, the one you loved."</p>
		<p>"He was the cutest little boy." Rose felt the body against hers relax as
			happy memories surfaced. "We were close when he was little. Whatever I was doing, he
			wanted to do. He was my shadow." A tear fell and Ronnie swallowed hard.</p>
		<p>"Hey, will you do something for me?"</p>
		<p>A nod. "Anything."</p>
		<p>"Think back to a happy time, just you and Tommy. Close your eyes and picture it in
			your head." She waited a few seconds. "Are you seeing it? Now, tell me about it.
			Is it summer or winter?"</p>
		<p>"Summer."</p>
		<p>"Inside or out?"</p>
		<p>"Out. We're at the family camp."</p>
		<p>"What are you two doing?"</p>
		<p>"Fishing." Rose felt Ronnie smile against her chest. "It was a perfect
			day. We were on the dock, just the two of us." Her brow furrowed. "I don't know
			where everyone else was."</p>
		<p>"Don't worry about them," the young woman cooed, continuing her gentle
			stroking of the dark tresses. "You were fishing with Tommy. Did you catch a
			fish?"</p>
		<p>"I didn't but he did." She relaxed against Rose again. "Nice foot long
			bass. Fought like the devil too."</p>
		<p>"Close your eyes. Now think about that day and how much fun you and Tommy had
			together. That's right?" Rose closed her own eyes and let the deep and even
			breathing near her ear lull her into the same peaceful sleep.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Rose was a constant source of support for Ronnie. The autopsy report had come back with
			unpleasant news. A variety of illegal drugs were found in Tommy's system. The Cartwrights
			had hoped to keep the information private, but they were a name in Albany and while the
			morning news reported that one of the Cartwrights had died in a freak accident, the
			evening news was not as kind. One station, finding the perfect excuse to reuse old
			footage, hooked the news of Tommy's autopsy with a report on drugs in Corporate America.
			It produced, much to the family's dismay, a gaggle of news reporters around Ronnie's home,
			refusing to accept her short statement that the family was in mourning and had no comment
			on the autopsy findings. Before the day was out, they received word that the driver of the
			dump truck had filed a suit against Tommy's estate. Beatrice declared the autopsy nothing
			less than an "exaggerated fabrication" and the truck driver "a greedy
			opportunist" trying to take advantage of an unfortunate accident. Rose listened to
			the remarks and nodded often, doing her part to make things easier on Ronnie.</p>
		<p>By the day of the funeral, however, the executive's patience and tolerance were both in
			short supply. The past few days had piled frustration upon frustration on her and the
			family seemed blissfully ignorant of the strain they were putting on her. Not only did
			they gather at her house to mourn, they gathered to visit with each other, allowing Ronnie
			no privacy or peace. Despite Rose's best efforts, Beatrice still managed to slip past and
			grill her daughter about every detail of the service. There was bickering from the
			littlest thing, such as who rode in which limousine, to who would be the pallbearers, even
			to which plot in the family section he should be buried in. Ronnie kept her anger inside
			herself, releasing it only after everyone had gone. Then, her punching bag would be the
			recipient. Only when she was both physically and emotionally exhausted would she curl into
			bed and seek the comfort of Rose's arms. The role reversal felt odd yet at the same time
			comforting to Ronnie. In the smaller woman's embrace she was able to let the stress go and
			find peace. It reinforced her inner strength, allowing her to face the challenges of the
			recent events.</p>
		<p>"Maria will be here in about an hour or so to pick you up." Ronnie zipped up
			her skirt and reached for the belt. "She'll be coming back here instead of going to
			the graveside service so someone will be here when the people start arriving." She
			buckled the belt and pulled on the blazer. "There. I believe I'm ready now." She
			put a small black hat on over her pinned hair.</p>
		<p>"I wish I could be there with you," Rose said earnestly.</p>
		<p>"I know, Hon." She cupped the younger woman's chin. "I don't know what I
			would have done without you these past few days."</p>
		<p>"I don't know what I would have done without you these last few months," Rose
			countered.</p>
		<p>"You know if I had my way you'd be right up there next to me."</p>
		<p>"It's better if I stay in the back with Maria. It will be easier to get in and out
			with my crutches."</p>
		<p>"Oh, let me help you with your sneaker before I go."</p>
		<p>"I can get it, Ronnie. You'll wrinkle your skirt."</p>
		<p>"Sit." Her long fingers made quick work of loosening the laces. She knelt
			down and put one hand on the back of Rose's calf. The satiny material of her knee high
			hose was no match to the natural softness Ronnie usually felt. Using her knee as a
			footrest, she put the sneaker on her companion's foot and began tying it. "Remember,
			the church is going to be packed. Make sure you get a seat. I don't want to find you
			leaning up against the back wall, you got it?"</p>
		<p>"Got it." She leaned down and adjusted the bow on Ronnie's blouse. "Got
			your handkerchief?"</p>
		<p>"And a spare."</p>
		<p>"All right then, I guess you're ready." Rose paused for a second, then put
			her hands on the taller woman's shoulders. "Ronnie, I know you think you have to be
			this big, strong superwoman but you don't. Even though you two had problems, he was still
			your brother and I know you loved him. If you have to cry, do it." Her words earned
			her a gentle kiss on the forehead as her companion stood up.</p>
		<p>"I'll see you after the service." Ronnie remained stooped long enough to tuck
			an errant strand of gold hair behind Rose's ear.
			<i>If only there was a way to have you
				with me today. It's going to be so hard today without you right there by my side.</i>
		</p>
		<p>As expected, the church was packed with friends, family, and business associates of the
			Cartwrights. Despite Ronnie's words, Rose was content to stand against the back wall but a
			man sitting in the last pew stood and offered his seat. Remaining at the back wall, Maria
			took possession of the crutches so no one would trip over them. From their position at the
			rear of the large church it was impossible to see Beatrice and her daughters in the front
			pew. Rose listened to the monotone words as the priest went through the standard phrases
			of comfort and prayers of solace. When the end drew near, she motioned to Maria for her
			crutches, deciding it was easier to get out now than wait and get caught up in the throngs
			of people.</p>
		<p>Just as she was getting into Maria's car the doors of the church opened. From her
			vantage point, she could see the six men carrying out the casket. She watched as Beatrice
			exited, flanked by her daughters. Rose squinted but was too far away to really see
			Ronnie's eyes. Her friend's head was hung and her arm was around her distraught mother.
			She saw that Susan was also providing support to the grieving woman as they walked down
			the steps and into the waiting limousine. Realizing Maria was waiting for her, Rose put
			her crutches in the back seat and got into the car.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Just as Ronnie had predicted, friends and family members began pouring into the house
			less than half an hour after the funeral had ended. Long tables covered one side of the
			living room, stacked high with breads, meats, and cheeses. Leaning against one wall out of
			the main flow of traffic, Rose noticed it was the first place people went to as they
			arrived. Since the laundry room had plenty of rods and hangers, it served as a makeshift
			coatroom. The cool March winds delayed any idea people may have had about putting their
			coats away for the season just yet.</p>
		<p>The floodgates were open and close to fifty people were there by the time Ronnie
			arrived with her mother and sister. Rose spotted the mane of dark hair above the rest of
			the crowd and began to work her way over. The trip was made easier when she had been
			spotted and the determined executive met her halfway. "Hi." This close, it was
			easy to see makeup concealing the dark circles beneath Ronnie's eyes. Leaning heavily on
			her right crutch, Rose discreetly reached over and intertwined their fingers, giving them
			a slight squeeze.</p>
		<p>"Hi yourself," Ronnie said, returning the affectionate gesture with one of
			her own. "Quite the crowd." She scanned the area, quickly noting those who would
			be problems as time went on and the drinks continued to flow. "You wait, Rose. Before
			the night is through I'll guarantee you at least one fist fight."</p>
		<p>"Fist fight? At a funeral?"</p>
		<p>"I give them one hour to lament Tommy's death. After that, the topic will turn to
			his will and speculations over who gets what and then the fighting will start, I'm
			sure." They worked their way over to a corner near the stairs. Rose watched as her
			companion shifted her weight from one leg to the other and back again.</p>
		<p>
			<i>I think you've suffered in those clothes long enough,</i> Rose thought to herself.
		</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, come into my room for a minute."</p>
		<p>"Sure," she replied, grateful for any chance to get away.</p>
		<p>The first thing Ronnie noticed when she entered the room was one of her outfits neatly
			laid out on the bed. "I thought you would be more comfortable in your slacks,"
			Rose said with a shrug. To the pointed look at the shoes on the floor she added, "I
			know how much your feet hurt after being in heels all day. Flats are perfectly acceptable
			with those slacks. I've seen you wear them before."</p>
		<p>"So you had Maria pick these out for me?"</p>
		<p>"No," Rose replied with a proud smile. "I picked them out myself and
			brought them down. Maria was busy."</p>
		<p>The thoughtfulness almost brought Ronnie to tears. Blinking rapidly, she reached out
			and let one finger trace the smaller woman's jawline. "Thank you." She took a
			step back and kicked off her shoes. "I'd better get changed and back out there. I'm
			sure someone is looking for me. Probably my mother." She added the last part under
			her breath. The skirt hit the floor followed quickly by her half-slip.</p>
		<p>"Did everything go well at the service?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing I couldn't handle." Ronnie's jaw tightened noticeably but she said
			nothing, instead picking up her slacks and sliding them on over pantyhose covered legs.
			Rose noticed the tension but said nothing, assuming it to be from the stress of the
			funeral and the relatives. Long toes wiggled their way into comfortable but stylish shoes
			while the gray blouse was tucked into the thin waistband. "Ah, I feel better
			already."</p>
		<p>"Is there anything I can do for you?" Rose asked. "Other than trying to
			keep your mother busy. She's getting tired of me hanging around her, you know."</p>
		<p>"I heard. Susan will run interference for the most part. You can either stay in
			here, which I highly recommend by the way, or you can just go out there and listen to my
			cousins and second cousins and God knows who else ramble on about nothing of
			importance."</p>
		<p>"Well, when you put it that way." Smiling green eyes accompanied the
			sarcastic remark. "How can I resist?"</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>To Rose, the sound was nothing but a general din. Ronnie, on the other hand, spent
			years learning how to work a crowd and was able to pick out the individual conversations
			easily. As she moved through the room, she carefully listened to the different snippets.
			By the time she reached Frank, she knew more about the new boat that her cousin was buying
			than he did. The knowledge allowed her to slip effortlessly into the conversation. Moving
			from person to person, Ronnie canvassed the room. When she thought she had said hello to
			everyone, she tried slipping out to the kitchen where she had seen her blonde beauty go a
			few minutes before.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie." Blue eyes rolled at the sound of her mother's voice.</p>
		<p>"Yes, Mother?" She turned to see Beatrice standing behind her. For that
			instant, the agitation she had felt toward her parent dissipated in the face of the
			grieving woman. Ronnie instantly softened her tone. "Is there something you
			need?"</p>
		<p>"Where is your sister?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know." She craned her neck to see over the crowd but there was no
			sign of the distinctive red hair. "Maybe Jack took her home."</p>
		<p>"Now Veronica," the wrinkled hands went to her hips. "You know Susan
			wouldn't leave without saying goodbye to me," she admonished. "Honestly,
			sometimes I wonder what you're thinking."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Mother. I wasn't thinking." The executive resisted the urge to
			rub her temples. It was a useless defense against a mother headache anyway.</p>
		<p>"Well, Tommy's death has affected us all." Beatrice dabbed at her eyes with
			her handkerchief. "Your father had such high hopes for him. A tragic shame, that's
			what it is." A gnarled finger raised itself into the air and the matriarch's eyes
			grew wide. "I have it."</p>
		<p>"Have what?" Ronnie asked hesitantly, certain she wouldn't like the answer.</p>
		<p>"The perfect way to pass on Tommy's legacy. He always did enjoy his time in
			college. You can set up a scholarship in his name." A self-satisfied smile formed on
			the older woman's face. "Yes, that would be the perfect way to honor him."</p>
		<p>"We can talk about that some other time, Mother."</p>
		<p>"There's nothing to talk about," Beatrice said firmly. Ronnie's eyes narrowed
			slightly when she saw Michael slip up behind her mother.</p>
		<p>"Hi Aunt Beatrice, hi Ronnie."</p>
		<p>"Michael," the executive said evenly.</p>
		<p>"What's everyone drinking?" He held up his empty glass.</p>
		<p>"Nothing for me," Ronnie said.
			<i>And I'm willing to bet that yours has been
				emptied more than once,</i> she thought to herself as the faint smell of alcohol floated
			over to her. Beatrice held up her almost full glass to indicate that she was fine at the
			moment as well.
		</p>
		<p>"Oh well." He looked at his shoes, then back up at the two women. "So
			Ronnie, have you decided when you're going to have his will read?"</p>
		<p>"I didn't realize there was a great hurry to having it done, Michael," she
			said. The daggers her eyes were throwing were wasted on him since his gaze was everywhere
			except at her.</p>
		<p>"No, no hurry at all," he shrugged. "It's just that we were close and I
			thought I should know when it is." He looked up and finally realized what deadly
			looks he was getting. "Well um?" he tried clearing his throat, which
			suddenly felt like a lemon was wedged in it. "I'm sure you'll let me know when it
			is."</p>
		<p>"I'll make sure everyone affected is notified."</p>
		<p>"Right, like I said." He wiped his sweaty hand on the side of his jacket.
			"Well, if you ladies will excuse me." He turned and took his aunt's hand in his
			own. "Aunt Beatrice, I'm sorry for your loss." Ronnie rolled her eyes when
			Michael kissed the older woman's hand. "Cuz, I'll see you around." He
			disappeared into the crowd, leaving her once again alone with her mother.</p>
		<p>"Um, I think I'd better go see if everything's all right in the kitchen." She
			took a half step back in preparation for a quick escape.</p>
		<p>"Nonsense. I'm sure Maria can handle anything that comes up," Beatrice said
			dismissively. "Why don't you go find your sister?"</p>
		<p>"That sounds like a good idea, Mother. Be right back." Ronnie turned and
			moved through the crowd as quickly as she could. To her unpleasant surprise, she ended up
			face to face with Michael.</p>
		<p>"Ah, fancy meeting you here," he said, smirking at his own joke.</p>
		<p>"Don't you think the Eddie Haskell routine was a bit much, Michael?"</p>
		<p>"Oh please, that's just my natural charm."</p>
		<p>"Whatever." As much as she enjoyed a good verbal fight, this was neither the
			time nor the place for it. "Have you seen Susan?"</p>
		<p>"Last time I saw her she was out in the kitchen with that friend of yours."
			Raised voices caught both their attention.</p>
		<p>"?.Bullshit, John. I told you to sell when they were at forty-eight and an
			eighth. It's not my fault you didn't do it." People quickly moved away from the two
			angry men, forming a circle.</p>
		<p>"You're my broker. You're supposed to take care of these things for me. Do you
			have any idea how much money I lost?"</p>
		<p>"You knew they were talking merger." Ronnie broke through the circle at that
			moment. "If you don't act fast, you lose out."</p>
		<p>"Like Sally Ryan?" The executive took a deep breath. Old girlfriend's names
			were never a good sign.</p>
		<p>"You knew she didn't have a date for the dance. It's not my fault I asked her out
			before you did."</p>
		<p>"You knew I wanted to go out with her. She was all I talked about that year."</p>
		<p>Ronnie knew this was going to escalate quickly into a classic Cartwright scuffle. She
			stepped between the fighting brothers. "ENOUGH! You are supposed to be here mourning
			Tommy's death, not fighting over some girl you lost fifteen years ago." An intense
			throbbing began behind her eyes, the sign of a relative headache. "John, you're not
			in high school anymore. Get over it." The men exchanged foul looks and stormed off in
			different directions. A murmur of words and then everyone else returned to their previous
			conversations. Ronnie ran her fingers through her hair forcefully. </p>
		<p>"You okay?" a soft voice from behind her asked.</p>
		<p>"Yeah." She turned to see familiar green eyes looking up at her with concern.
			"Really, Rose. I'm fine."</p>
		<p>"Just making sure. I heard you yell."</p>
		<p>"Just a typical Cartwright get-together," Ronnie sputtered. She caught a
			flash of orange-red out of the corner of her eye. "Uh oh." Susan and her mother
			were approaching fast. "I see Mother found you," she said once her sister was
			within earshot.</p>
		<p>"I told you she hadn't left yet," Beatrice said. The look in Susan's eyes
			made it clear she wished she had not been found.
			<i>Oh boy, this is gonna be a good one,</i>
			Ronnie thought to herself. "I was just telling your sister that I want to go through
			Tommy's things. I assume you still have boxes up in the attic?"
		</p>
		<p>"What, from when he lived here? He took what he wanted and I threw out the
			rest."</p>
		<p>"But there were trophies and ribbons and awards??"</p>
		<p>"If he didn't take them, they're gone."</p>
		<p>"And it never occurred to you that I might want those things?" Beatrice stood
			directly in front of her eldest child. "How could you be so inconsiderate?"</p>
		<p>"Mother!" Susan exclaimed. Rose stood there quietly, her attention focused on
			the twitching muscle in Ronnie's jaw.</p>
		<p>"Tomorrow I'll go over to his apartment and see if he kept anything." </p>
		<p>"Don't bother. Your sister will take me over and I'll look for myself." The
			sisters exchanged glances. Susan shrugged her shoulders. This was the first she was
			hearing of it as well.</p>
		<p>"I think you should wait a few days, Mother. His belongings aren't going
			anywhere." Ronnie was worried about what they would find there.</p>
		<p>"Nonsense. Tomorrow will be fine."</p>
		<p>"I don't think tomorrow?"</p>
		<p>"Veronica Louise!" The twitching became a solid clench. Rose moved closer to
			her friend and discreetly placed her fingertips against Ronnie's back. The muscles were
			bunched and tight, another indication of Ronnie's tension. She pressed slightly and began
			rubbing in small circles.</p>
		<p>"Fine, Mother. Susan and I will take you to Tommy?s tomorrow."
			<i>Great,
				now I have to go over tonight and check things out. </i>She leaned almost imperceptibly
			into the gentle touch of Rose's fingers.
		</p>
		<p>"Honestly, I don't know why you make things so difficult, Ronnie. On this day of
			all days you have to be stubborn." Beatrice dabbed at dry eyes with her handkerchief.
			"I ask a simple thing. I just want something to remember my son by and you have to be
			difficult."</p>
		<p>"Mother?"</p>
		<p>"No Susan. I asked one simple thing of her. Just because she couldn't get along
			with her brother is no excuse for upsetting me."</p>
		<p>Ronnie's back was now a solid band of tension and it took her a moment before she could
			relax her jaw enough to speak. The gentle circling motion on her back increased in
			pressure.
			<i>You think I'm about to lose it, don't you? </i>She cast a sideways glance at
			her companion. Seeing the look of understanding and support in those green eyes was enough
			to keep the sharp remark from passing through her lips. Instead she looked at her mother
			and nodded. "I didn't mean to upset you. I guess we're all still in shock."
			Ronnie knew she was caving in, but today was not the day to make a stand with her mother.
			"I had better go check on things. Excuse me." With her back to her mother, she
			gave Rose a loving smile and left the room.
		</p>
		<p>Entering the kitchen, Ronnie was pleased to see that the only person there was Maria.
			She walked to the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of water. She took a long swallow
			before speaking to her housekeeper. "Do you have any aspirin? I have a pounding
			headache and I really don't want to go out there again."</p>
		<p>"Been talking to your mother again, haven't you?" Maria opened a drawer and
			pulled out her purse. "I'm sure there's some Tylenol or Motrin in here."</p>
		<p>"Sorry," Susan said as she entered. "She's in rare form today." The
			two sisters stood near the end of the island. Maria found something to do in the laundry
			room, allowing the two women their privacy.</p>
		<p>"When was the last time you were at his place?" Ronnie asked before tossing
			three pills into her mouth and taking several gulps of water.</p>
		<p>"This one? I've never been there. Why would I go to his apartment?"</p>
		<p>"We're going to have to go there, you know. Who knows what it looks like or what
			things he may have laying out." She put the bottle back into the fridge. "Can
			Jack keep an eye on the kids?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sure he can." Susan looked at her watch. "We're going to be leaving
			in a few minutes. You want to meet at Tommy's place around six or seven?"</p>
		<p>"Seven would be better. Who knows how long everyone is going to stay." Ronnie
			looked out the glass door at the rainbow of cars that littered her driveway. "At
			least another hour or two."</p>
		<p>"And then there's Mother."</p>
		<p>"Oh no." Ronnie shook her head. "You are
			<i>not</i> going to leave her
			here with me. When you go, she goes." She cast a glance at the living room.
			"Speaking of which, what's she up to?"
		</p>
		<p>"I don't know. After you walked away she kept going on and on until Rose asked her
			something about Tommy and his trophies. I saw that as my escape and took it." The
			redhead leaned in and spoke in a conspiratorial tone. "Personally, I don't think
			she's really interested in his trophies."</p>
		<p>Ronnie smiled with pride. "She isn't. She's trying to keep me from committing
			matricide."</p>
		<p>"Did you want to bring her along tonight?" Susan offered.</p>
		<p>"No. Hopefully we won't be there long." She paused for a moment, then added
			"but it was nice of you to ask." She sighed and rapped her knuckles on the
			countertop. "I suppose I can't hide out here forever."</p>
		<p>"I'll take Mother with us when we leave. You won't have to suffer much
			longer."</p>
		<p>"How did I ever survive eighteen years with her?" Ronnie asked, shaking her
			head in bewilderment. "I can't get through one day without wanting to tell her off or
			wring her neck."</p>
		<p>"Oh, that's easy," the redhead smiled. "I was there most of the
			time."</p>
		<p>"That's right, you were." Ronnie tapped an elegant finger on her chin.
			"I remember you." She dodged a playful shove. "Weren't you the one that ran
			into Dad's car with your bike and blamed me?"</p>
		<p>"Um?well that was a long time ago, Ronnie. Weren't you the one that forgot to
			unlock your window one night and had to sneak back in through mine?"</p>
		<p>"Ah, true." She wrapped her arm around her sister's shoulders. "But
			weren't you the one?" she began as they walked back into the living room.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie put the key in the lock. "What's that smell?" she asked, wrinkling her
			nose. Susan shrugged her lack of an answer and pulled a scarf out of her pocketbook. The
			door opened and the executive flipped the switch. "Son of a bitch," she
			breathed. Clothes were tossed everywhere, the couch cushions were on the floor, the coffee
			table and every other horizontal surface was covered with beer cans and trash. Stale beer
			and unwashed clothes mixed with another unidentifiable smell.</p>
		<p>"Oh my God," Susan said as she took in the scene. "This is
			disgusting."</p>
		<p>"Sad is more like it," Ronnie muttered, picking up a small square mirror she
			found lying on the counter. The telltale razor blade was resting next to it. "It's a
			good thing we came here first." She showed her sister the mirror clouded with a fine
			white powder. "There is no way we can have Mother see this place looking the way it
			does." Susan nodded in agreement. Ronnie tossed the offensive mirror onto the counter
			and unzipped her jacket. "I guess we'd better look around for some boxes and trash
			bags for all this shit." To her surprise, the redhead, who was adverse to any kind of
			domestic work, did not argue.</p>
		<p>"I'll put some music on," Susan said, kicking a path to the stereo.
			"Let's see, how does this one work?" She hit the power button and was
			immediately blasted with an insanely high decibel of noise.</p>
		<p>"SHUT THAT THING OFF!" Ronnie yelled while covering her ears. A second later
			there was peaceful quiet again.</p>
		<p>"How could he stand listening to it that loud?"</p>
		<p>"Damned if I know. Maybe the drugs affected his hearing. Come on. Let?s get
			to work. I want to get home at a decent hour." The kitchen shared a half-wall with
			the living room, allowing the two sisters to talk while packing up the garbage. Ronnie
			lifted the lid to the trashcan in the corner. "Oh God." She covered it up
			quickly. "I think I found out where that smell is coming from," she choked,
			taking a few steps back.</p>
		<p>"I can't smell that anymore," Susan called from the far side of the living
			room. "All I smell is beer." She moved a cushion to find a half-eaten pizza
			glued to the carpet. "Oh Ronnie, I don't want to touch this."</p>
		<p>"I'll tell you what. I'll clean up whatever it is you're looking at if you get
			these dishes out of this?um?I guess you'd call it water." She reached
			closer with the tips of her fingers but just could not bring herself to touch the slimy
			liquid. "I know I'm not touching it."</p>
		<p>"We should have brought gloves." The redhead picked up an empty beer case and
			started throwing bottles into it. "So things are good between you and Rose?" she
			asked casually.</p>
		<p>"We get along fine, yes." Ronnie arched an eyebrow. "Susan, I told
			you?"</p>
		<p>"I know, I know. You are not lovers, you're just friends." The younger sister
			waved her hand dismissively. "I give up trying to figure it out." She put the
			case down and walked over to the counter that separated the living room and kitchen.
			"She gives me the same story you do but you don't act like friends."</p>
		<p>"We have a lot of work to do here, Susan."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, look at me." When she spoke again, her voice was softer. "I
			don't care. I've watched the way the two of you act around each other."</p>
		<p>"And what did you see?"</p>
		<p>"What do I see?" Susan gave a small smile. "I see you happy in a way I
			never thought you would be." She laughed at her sister's blush. "Come on. You
			asked the question. Really Ronnie, it's obvious to me that you're hooked on her. As for
			how Rose feels about you?" The dark-haired woman's head snapped up. "She is
			not Chris."</p>
		<p>"No she's not," the executive agreed emphatically. "Rose has never asked
			me for anything. Whatever I've given her, it was because I wanted to."</p>
		<p>"I see that," Susan replied. "You don't think I've been watching? You
			take more days off than you ever have and you don't go anywhere. I don't see any new cars,
			although I didn't see your Porsche around. Did you sell it?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." The truth was, as soon as it was repaired, she had signed it over to
			Hans to sell at whatever price he could. "She doesn't want cars or expensive things.
			She doesn't even have a driver's license. She's not trying to get anything from me."</p>
		<p>Susan held her hands up. "You don't have to defend her, Ronnie. I was just saying
			I didn't see any of the things that would tell me she was using you and I don't believe
			she is. I like her."</p>
		<p>"You like her?" Surprise showed on her face. That was a rare admission from
			her younger sister. "So?it would be okay with you if we were?a
			couple?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not going to pretend that I understand why you want to be with a woman. It
			doesn't make any sense to me." She raised her hand to keep her sister from speaking.
			"But it is your life. If Rose makes you happy, then that's all that matters. So yes,
			it's okay with me if you two are a couple." She watched Ronnie come from behind the
			counter and happily accepted the hug. "It's your life, Sis. If Rose is the one for
			you then don't let anyone keep you apart," she whispered into the dark hair.</p>
		<p>Ronnie pulled back until they were an arm's length apart. "What made you change
			your mind? I remember you calling her everything but a reincarnation of Christine."</p>
		<p>"I was wrong," Susan shrugged. "Hey, it happens." She brushed her
			hands together.</p>
		<p>"I'm making her my secretary," Ronnie volunteered. "I've been bringing
			work home for her to do and so far there have been no mistakes." She smiled softly.
			"She's got a good head for figures too?and organized?" If anything, the
			smile grew wider. "You know how bad I am about sorting my email?"</p>
		<p>"You mean she straightened out that mess you call your inbox?" Susan shook
			her head. "I remember when you asked Laura to do that. I thought she was going to
			quit on you right then and there."</p>
		<p>"Rose did it without even being asked," Ronnie said proudly. "That's how
			she is."</p>
		<p>"It sounds like you are very lucky, Sis. Now enough of this sensitive chat. We
			have work to do here. You wanna try and get the stereo to a volume that doesn't shatter
			glass?"</p>
		<p>"Sure." Ronnie worked her way across the room, the smile never leaving her
			face.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"She said that?"</p>
		<p>"Yup?ooof."</p>
		<p>"Oops, sorry about that." Rose moved her elbows from Ronnie's chest and laid
			down, her arms crossed over the older woman's left breast. She rested her chin atop her
			interlaced fingers. "So she really said she liked me?"</p>
		<p>"She said she liked you." Ronnie smiled in the dark, letting her hand gently
			rub the smaller woman's back. "See? You've won over the Cartwright women."</p>
		<p>"Not all of them."</p>
		<p>"Honey, even I haven't won over my mother yet. I think you'll just have to accept
			that two out of three ain't bad."</p>
		<p>"Well?" Rose crept up until their faces were even, gold and black hair
			mixing about their shoulders. "There is really only one Cartwright's opinion that
			matters to me." Ronnie's eyes closed as soft lips pressed against her own. "And
			right now that Cartwright needs to get some sleep." Despite her words, Rose could not
			resist dropping down for a longer kiss. "Mmm, sometimes I wonder if I'm really
			Cinderella and you're holding the glass slipper."</p>
		<p>"If I was, that would make me one very lucky woman," Ronnie replied.</p>
		<p>"I'll never understand what made someone like you take a chance on someone like
			me." Rose shifted most of her weight onto the bed and claimed the older woman's
			shoulder as her pillow. "Sometimes I'm afraid this is all some wonderful dream and
			I'm going to wake up and find you gone," She felt Ronnie's arms tighten protectively
			around her.</p>
		<p>"I will never let that happen, Rose. I won't ever let you go back to the way you
			used to live."</p>
		<p>"That doesn't scare me." She nuzzled deeper into Ronnie's shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Then what does?"</p>
		<p>"Losing you," she quietly admitted. "All the money and possessions in
			the world don't mean a thing to me without you."</p>
		<p>"I love you too," Ronnie whispered, lifting her head up long enough to place
			a kiss on the top of Rose's head. They snuggled together, bumping legs until they found a
			comfortable position and the peaceful feeling of being with each other relaxed them into
			sleep.</p>
