<!-- Bound \ Chapter 8 - The Kalahari Homeworld -->

<P>The senior staff was seated around the conference table, listening to Seven's analysis of the M -class planet they had spent 3 weeks travelling to. Voyager was just outside it's solar system and had used both long-range scanners and passive scans to determine if the planet could supply any of the resources that the ship desperately needed and it's level of technological advancement.</P>
<P>"According to our sensor readings, Ensign Kim and I have determined that this planet has 12 major continents and 4 ocean masses. It's is considerably larger than Earth but has a similar oxygenated environment. The average temperature is 70 degrees on the western most landmass and the average rainfall is approximately 1200 microns per annum." Seven was nothing if not thorough.</P>
<P>"This is one of the more technologically advanced races that we have encountered, I  believe that we may be in a position to share our technology and learn from their own without the usual debate about the Prime Directive."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Seven," Janeway turned to the team. I think that our next action will be either to initiate first contact or to send observers to the planet surface. It would appear that they've got plenty of what we need."</P>
<P>"That's right," Harry added enthusiastically, "Some of the advancements they appear to have made in deflector technology appear to be astounding. I can't wait to get there."</P>
<P>"Don't pack your swimsuit just yet, Harry, we still need to be invited. We don't how this race will react to us. They are warp capable without any doubt, but we haven't detected any ion trails." Chakotay looked at Tuvok for confirmation.</P>
<P>"That is correct, Commander, it is evident that we will need to ...</P>

<P>B'Elanna tuned out, kind of. She was paying attention after all. But all of her attention was focused on Seven.</P>
<I><P>Damn, but she soooo cute when she's serious.</I> She frowned to herself, Since when do I use the word cute? </P>
<P>Seven returned to her seat beside B'Elanna and gave her a sidelong stare as she sat down.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres," she whispered, "you are not paying sufficient attention, what are you doing?"</P>
<P>" I'm just sitting here, daydreaming about you," B'Elanna whispered back. </P>
<P>"... Don't you think, Lieutenant?" the Captain asked the startled engineer.</P>
<P>"I think that's a valid point, Captain," B'Elanna replied without missing a beat. </P>
<P>Janeway nodded apparently satisfied with the response and turned back to Chakotay. Only Tukok noticed the twinkle in her eye.</P>
<P>" I prefer the more direct approach, we'll present ourselves on their doorstep and defy them to send us away," Janeway joked.</P>
<P>"Have Neelix break into full ambassador mode, also make sure that his recipe database is fully up to date. We have no idea what passes for currency on this homeworld."</P>
<P>"Captain, I very much doubt that we're going to get a tonne of dilithium in exchange for Neelix's chilli con carne recipe," Tom was sceptical.</P>
<P>"Whatever they want, within reason, I'm willing to barter," Janeway instructed. "B'Elanna, have Voyagers schematics updated to include the borg-related adjustments."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am." B'Elanna wasn't going to be caught twice.</P>
<P>"Seven, all of our star charts, have them ready." </P>
<P>Seven inclined her head in acknowledgement. </P>
<P>"Tom, lay in a course." The Captain stood indicating the end of the meeting.</P>
<P>"Dismissed."</P>
