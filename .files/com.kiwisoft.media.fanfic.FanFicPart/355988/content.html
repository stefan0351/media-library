<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Six -->

<p>Gretchen Brea sat down across from Cassidy on her stylish terrace and studied her with self-possessed brown eyes. She always appreciated Cassidy's beauty, could never pass up any time that Cassidy went to see her. Gretchen was a year older than Cassidy, they'd known each other for a little over six years, when Cassidy was going to the same college Gretchen was attending for law. Gretchen had been immediately seduced by Cassidy's intense seriousness. Gretchen had been all no joke and laughs, and Cassidy was a perfect contrast.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was beautiful then, as she was now. As was Gretchen, who had indeed seduced Cassidy with her British accent and snobbish attitude. Gretchen was also physically alluring, with deep brown eyes and a full black mane. A face out of a painting, narrowly straight nose, and full reddish lips, including imposingly beautiful full-figured body. Her voice was husky, though attractively feminine with its accent.</p>
		<p>As they spoke, with a slight flush to her cheeks, Cassidy recalled all those hotly intense moments between them. The sex between them had been volatile, explosive. Not one encounter would go by without each woman having a most intense orgasm more than once. Actually, sometimes they'd reached record in their sex, not pausing for many hours, until exhaustion and need for sleep stopped them. <i>Those were the days</i>, Cassidy thought with nostalgia.</p>
		<p>But Gretchen was now happily engaged to a beautiful and young Australian woman called Georgette; they'd been together for almost a year. Her friends called her George.</p>
		<p>Georgette Peterson was a prominent architect and interior designer with talent that many wish they had. Her talents weren't the only things that were envied about George. Her looks were roguishly beautiful, with a full head of short jet-black hair that framed her gorgeous face, a healthy dark olive complexion, and shiny blue eyes. She was tall like Cassidy, five foot nine, and had a body much like Cassidy's also, lithe, toned and muscled.</p>
		<p>Via Gretchen, Cassidy hired George to design her kitchen. George, who had liked Cassidy the moment she met her despite the fact that she knew about the tempestuous affair between Cassidy and Gretchen, wanted to do the job for free. But Cassidy refused to accept the gratuity and paid her with an article on the "promising architect and interior designer Georgette Peterson."</p>
		<p>Cassidy had many followers of her articles and books, many fans, and within days of the publishing of the article, flocs were flowing to hire George. George was grateful, and still owed Cassidy one, she swore. George was a lot like Cassidy, faithful to her friends and warm. Gretchen thought that's what made her fall in love in the first place. But soon, Gretchen saw past the similarities between George and Cassidy, and saw the George that was within, and fell in love anew.</p>
		<p>Presently, Gretchen was telling Cassidy of the hand-fasting date so that she could tell Andrea and Robie, and bring them. It would be in six months, and Gretchen wanted Cassidy to be her "best-lady." She was talking with a vigor Cassidy had never seen in her, a happiness that was unmistakably intense. She was happy for her, and wished she could have that kind of happiness for herself. But she knew that couldn't be, for her happiness lay only in the arms of Andrea Cates, the love of her life.</p>
		<p>The struggle she was going through at that moment was tearing her apart, thinking of Andrea, dreaming that it would be the two of them who would be together. She wanted so badly to hold her, to make love to her, to love her the way she wished she could. She was unaware of her eyes drifting away from Gretchen to a spot above her head. She was also unaware of Gretchen stopping her chatter to stare at her with knowing sympathy. "Cassidy," Gretchen said softly, but Cassidy still was away in her thoughts. Gretchen leaned forward, grasping her leg and squeezing it softly, saying firmly: "Cassidy."</p>
		<p>Cassidy started, and stared at Gretchen as if she didn't see her. "Oh, God, I'm so sorry!" She gushed, shaking her head. "I'm sorry, Gretchen, I don't know what came over me."</p>
		<p>Gretchen knew what had come over her, and that was thoughts of Andrea. Ever since their days together, Gretchen knew Cassidy's heart belonged to Andrea, and always would.</p>
		<p>Now it was a matter of Andrea's heart belonging to her. She always saw a behavior in Andrea towards Cassidy that no best friend ever had for another. Without realizing it, Andrea acted as if she too were in love with Cassidy. Never able to go a few hours without speaking to her; when they were together, never able to take her eyes off her, never able to stop hugging her. When they danced, fitting her body against Cassidy's as if it were a temple and it was an honor to press against it to sway to the music. Her eyes held tightly shut, the lids trembling slightly.</p>
		<p>And if Andrea <i>were</i> in love with Cassidy, Gretchen wouldn't be surprised. Cassidy was the dream of any woman who got to know her, perfect in every fashion, in every sense. She was surprised Robie wasn't asking her to marry her already, but then she knew that Robie's heart was someone else's. She had been the one who had introduced Robie and Cassidy. She knew of Robie's lover Isabella Del Monte, a prominent archeologist out in Europe or Africa or some place like that. She'd seen the devastation in Robie's eyes when she and Isabella agreed that it was best if they stopped being together if Isabella had to go far and for a long time because of her job. Robie had been desolate for months, until Gretchen had pushed her back into the dating world, instantly calling Cassidy up and pushing them to meet.</p>
		<p>Cassidy and Robie clicked instantly, and were more friends than anything else, though sex wasn't taken out of their friendship. They were still dating, but that was as far as it got.</p>
		<p>Gretchen smiled forgivingly at her friend, squeezing her thigh softly and letting go. "Its okay, Cassidy baby," She said in her husky, accented voice. "I know how Andrea brings this out on you, honey. Maybe you shouldn't walk around with this weight on your shoulders, my dear. Maybe you should confess to her that-"</p>
		<p>Cassidy cut her off with an impatient, angry gesture, standing from the lounging chair she had claimed. She glared down at Gretchen, feeling cornered by everything and everyone. "Can't I go to places without worrying that every single one of my friends is going to pressure me into doing something I don't want to do?" She growled at her, not able to hold back her anger.</p>
		<p>Gretchen stared at her unflinchingly, allowing her to spew out her anger. She didn't say one thing to her for a long while, just stared at her, watching the conflicting emotions playing across the noble features. With a lilting arch of her eyebrow, Gretchen pursed her lips in musing. "I don't know why you put yourself through this agony," She finally said in an even voice, though she was frustrated. "When all you have to do is tell Andrea that you love her and she would fall into your arms like the woman in love with you that she is."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes tightly, clenching her jaw. "Andrea... is... a... virile... <i>hetero</i>sexual... woman..." She pronounced every word with rising anger. "I... am... only... her... best friend-"</p>
		<p>Gretchen felt like releasing a 'wake up and smell the coffee' hand and allowing it to land across Cassidy's face, but that had been one of the reasons for their agreeing to end their relationship. Physical abuse against one another, inability to restrain their anger. She shook the memories away. Unhappy memories of their past were not necessary at that moment. "Cassidy," She said, standing up from her chair and staring up in bewilderment at her friend. "I can't believe you are so <i>hard</i>-headed sometimes! Goodness gracious!" She exclaimed in exasperation.</p>
		<p>Cassidy turned away from her and crossed her arms, a double wall against Gretchen. "Gretchen," Cassidy said in as even a voice as she could muster, and paused. "I love Andrea as I've never loved anything or anyone in my life." She said softly afterwards, closing her eyes against the pain. "I could not live if I lost her because of my feelings, I could not endure the thought of Andrea leaving me because of my feelings for her... She is my world, my sun... I would die, Gretchen." Her voice was thick with tears; she closed her eyes against them. "I would take my own life." She brought out her arms to stare at her scarred wrists. "It hasn't been hard for me before..." Her voice trailed off.</p>
		<p>"Even now," She continued in a low voice, never taking her eyes away from the ever-tempting scars. "Even now that I have her as my best friend, I feel the need to just cease to exist, to just leave this godforsaken world and this misery. A misery I have no idea where it came from." She spoke numbly, unaware of Gretchen's tears. "She is the only thing that keeps me anchored, that keeps me from attempting against myself again. I can't bear the thought of loosing her."</p>
		<p>Gretchen was instantly sorry she'd pressured Cassidy. She never really knew how vulnerable Cassidy really was. The tough exterior was so well in place that even <i>she</i> couldn't see past it. Except for now. She turned Cassidy to face her and hugged her tightly, placing her hand behind Cassidy's head and forcing her face to rest against her shoulder. Cassidy didn't resist for long, she wrapped her arms around Gretchen's plush waist and rested against her. "I'm sorry, Cassidy baby," Gretchen crooned, feeling for her from the very bottom of her heart. "I'm so very sorry."</p>
		<p>She felt Cassidy nod against her shoulder, tightening her arms around her waist in a forgiving gesture. She pulled back after a long moment and just stared at her friend with eyes full of pain. And then she smiled her beautiful charming smile, the smile that only brought a lilt to the right side of her lips, that made her eyes crinkle at the corners, and a gentle dimple appear on her right cheek. <i>She has always been so stunning,</i> Gretchen thought with deep love for her friend.</p>
		<p>"You're my friend, right?" Cassidy asked huskily, moving her head forward and pressing her forehead against Gretchen's. </p>
		<p>Gretchen nodded slowly. "And I love you as such." She replied softly. "I want you to always know that I am here, and so is George. She loves you very much, Cassidy." She suddenly threw her head back and laughed, bringing her hands down from Cassidy's shoulders to squeeze her arms tenderly. "I never thought a lover of mine would end up loving you as much as George does, considering the fact we meant so much to each other only a few years ago."</p>
		<p>"You still mean a lot to me, Gretchen," Cassidy said softly, still keeping her arms around Gretchen's waist and looking down at her. "You always will. And no matter how our relationship ended, you stuck by, as if I didn't do the things I did to you." She continued sadly.</p>
		<p>Gretchen shook her head softly in disagreement. "And what about from me to you, honey." She said gently, touching Cassidy's face tenderly. "What about what I did to you? We really fucked each other up back then, baby. It was all so unnecessary."</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled gently, feeling the smoothness of Gretchen's palm on her cheek. "You and George don't do that to each other, do you?" She asked softly with concern.</p>
		<p>A husky rumble came from Gretchen's throat. Laughter. "Ooh, no!" She said with laughter. "She would never take it." She paused, her laughter died away. She said in a low voice: "And I guess I've grown up. Haven't you, Cassidy-baby?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded slowly. "I think I have too." She said. "Twenty eight in a few months, Gretchen. I'm getting old."</p>
		<p>"And more gorgeous by the minute." Gretchen said with a smile. She hugged Cassidy to her and pulled away slowly when they heard the door slam.</p>
		<p>George's boisterous accented voice carried across the apartment. "Cassidy," She called, sounding very happy. "Where the hell are you, old gal? I saw your car downstairs!"</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed. "I'm right here, Georgie Porgy." She called out. George breezed through the terrace doors and ran to her, taking her in her arms. She rocked her tenderly, as she always did despite her strength. "Hey, George." Cassidy said with a laugh, wrapping her arms around her too.</p>
		<p>George pulled back, smiling at her. "Hey, baby." Her Australian accent punctuating the word "bay-by." She looked from Cassidy to Gretchen with mock suspicion. "What were you doing to my lover out here?" She asked with narrowed smiling blue eyes.</p>
		<p>Gretchen laughed and walked over to them, slapping her lightly on the butt. "You have one dirty mind, my lovely butch." She chided. "Now, come give me a kiss."</p>
		<p>George went to her and took her tightly into her strong arms, placing a nice wet kiss on her lips. "Hey, babe." She said softly, touching her lover's face with a finger. Gretchen seemed speechless at George's eternal tenderness; she just smiled.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled at her two friends. "Well, I've got to go." She said, looking at the time. EIGHT O'CLOCK. "Got a date with Robie tonight."</p>
