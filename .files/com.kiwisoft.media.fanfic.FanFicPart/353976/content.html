<!-- The Closet \ Part Nine -->

<p>Sam extended her hand managing to both whack Brooke in the chest and
halt her progress.  Brooke looked down at the spot Sam had hit and
made a face barely registering the brunette's mumbled "janitor" and
she rubbed her now sore spot.  Trying to distract herself, Brooke
looked up and watched as Sam's head bobbed around the corner as she
spied on the janitors movements while muttering to herself about
something or the other.  Looking back down again Brooke suppose she
should be grateful Sam hadn't landed her blow a few centimeters lower.</p>

<p>"Come on," Sam whispered to Brooke as she crept out from behind the
wall they had been hiding behind.  The halls of the museum were
practically empty and even the soft sounds of their feet scuffling
along the floor reverberated against the walls.</p>

<p>Brooke looked around her in something close to wonder, the place
seemed grander in the silence, she felt more humbled.  She thought
that she would have liked visiting museums much more if they were
always like this.</p>

<p>"In here," Sam said, hesitating for a moment before finally reaching
out and taking Brooke's hand into hers.  The blonde seemed distracted
and she had to get her attention somehow.  Brooke looked over at her
immediately after their hands touched, her gaze dropping to their
conjoined hands for a moment before she began to walk in the direction
Sam was facing.  To the brunette's surprise, and pleasure Brooke made
no effort to remove her hand from Sam's once they began to walk again,
and by some silent accord Sam made no effort to let go of Brooke's
either.</p>

<p>As Sam stopped in front of a janitorial closet Brooke looked over at
her simultaneously smiling and rising a questioning eyebrow.  It was a
look that said "what the hell" but in a sleazy, porn director kind of
way.</p>

<p>"Shut up Brooke," Sam muttered as she opened the door and slipped
inside.  Brooke followed behind her letting the door close as they
became submerged in darkness.  "There's a light over here somewhere,"
Sam said stepping away from the door.  A minute - and a couple of
bumps and colourful phrases - later Sam turned on the light and the
room was covered in a dim yellow glow.</p>

<p>Sam quickly made her way over to the overturned box which had served
as Arabian Knights desk, dropping down and crouching over it as she
got there.  "Shit," she muttered as she looked around the box with no
luck.  She wondered if maybe the janitor had found the fallen folder
while he was in there, but then her eye caught something just over to
the left.  Reaching out, she closed her eyes let out a relieved sigh,
it was still there.  Picking up the folder and smiling she turned
around to face Brooke who was watching her with a curious but patient
expression.  If she hadn't have just found the folder on the floor she
would have brought it to her lips and given it a big kiss.  As if was,
as the wave of euphoria rushed through her body she had to struggle
not to yell 'yes!' pump her fists in the air and give Brooke a big
hug.</p>

<p>"We can go now," is what she said however.</p>

<p>"Good," Brooke said turning around and reaching for the door knob.</p>

<p>"Come on, I thought you were in a hurry," Sam said a moment later as
she walked up behind Brooke who still hadn't opened the door.</p>

<p>Brooke turned around to face Sam, her features were drawn and she was
blinking rapidly.  "The door's locked," she stated.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"The door.  It's locked," Brooke repeated her left eye twitching
slightly.</p>

<p>"It can't be," Sam responded pushing past Brooke and reaching for the
handle herself.  She turned it and pushed.  Nothing happened.  She
tried it again to the same effect.  "The door's locked," she said
softly a second later.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I covered that," Brooke responded.  "Not that I'm trying to
usurp control or anything, but I've rapidly come to the conclusion
that secrecy is no longer our friend, and that if we want to get out
of here we better start yelling like now," she finished still watching
Sam.</p>

<p>"I concur," Sam replied immediately.  "After you," she said waving her
hand graciously.</p>

<p>Brooke nodded her head and opened her mouth to begin screaming like a
baby in any enclosed space when the light in the hall outside the door
suddenly went out.  She turned her head to look at Sam, in moments of
crisis like this it was always good to consult with others.  They
stared at each other for a second then they both flung themselves at
the door and began banging on it and screaming for all they were
worth.</p>
