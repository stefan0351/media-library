<P>Tuvok walked into Captain Janeway's ready-room looking like the cool
confident Vulcan that he was. No matter how hard Janeway tried, she could never
tell if the Vulcan had good news or bad. So she did the next best thing, hope
for good news. Janeway looked up from her computer screen and asked "Anything
good?" She was actually pleading for good news, something she didn't do
often.</P>
<P>Tuvok simply answered, "This does not seem particularly good or bad, but I
will let you decide. It seems that the temporal distortion is unstable and is
constantly changing." Tuvok clasped his hands behind his back.</P>
<P>"What do you mean it's changing?" Kathryn stood up.</P>
<P>"The ratio has changed from that of 1:7, to that of only 1:2. One may
interpret that as good, on the other hand we have no way of knowing if that
ratio will change to something worse." Tuvok hoped the Captain would take this
as a good sign. But in all his experience with humans, they always seemed to
look at the negative rather than the positive, well everyone except for Captain
Janeway.</P>
<P>"If it does, then we'll just have to deal with it. Right now, our best bet is
to try and find a way to set up the Delta Flyer to withstand the bio-electric
field emanating from that planet. If only we had our Chief Engineer to help us,
or our resident Borg for that matter, but I had to push Seven into going on that
away mission, stupid me." Janeway scolded herself, in front of a very
uncomfortable Vulcan. </P>
<P>"I believe placing the blame on yourself will only make matters worse, you
should be concentrating on the Delta-Flyer, after all, you still have Lt.
Paris." Tuvok couldn't believe he had actually said that, after all he thought
Paris was mostly annoying.</P>
<P>"You're right, Paris practically built the Flyer by himself. If anyone should
know how to equip a force field to protect it, it would be him." Janeway patted
Tuvok on the shoulder and walked out of her ready-room and onto the bridge.</P>
<P>Tuvok wanted to say that it was him who did most of the work, while Paris
simply tried to make it look cool. But he decided to let Paris have his moment,
ironically without him being there.</P>
<P>Down on the planet sun was glaring red hot and B'Elanna was on the verge of
collapse. "How much longer to the Caves, I think I'm gonna pass out if we don't
make it there soon." B'Elanna was panting, trying to hold on to the last of her
apples while biting into a new one.</P>
<P>"We would already be there if you did not insist on bringing the entire
orchard of apples." Seven chastised.</P>
<P>"Very funny Seven, but they're a great source of water, and in this sun we
need all we can get. Want one?" B'Elanna offered her one of her remaining four
uneaten apples. </P>
<P>"I do not require nutrition at this time." The Borg seemed peeved.</P>
<P>"Well, you did miss your regeneration cycle right, so I think you do need
it." B'Elanna pushed the already annoyed Borg.</P>
<P>"There are more pressing matters, such as the whereabouts of our missing
crewman. I do not have time to eat." Seven pushed back.</P>
<P>"You'll be more efficient on a half-full stomach then on an empty one I'll
bet. Come on Seven, I promise I won't yell at you like I did before." B'Elanna
walked right up to the beautiful blonde and held it in front of her body.</P>
<P>"Very well, I will eat it, but we must continue on our way. We have already
wasted too much time arguing over this matter." Seven snatched the apple and
began walking towards the caves, not looking back.</P>
<P>"Great, not even a thank you." B'Elanna muttered to herself as she watched
the Borg turn around and pick up the pace.</P>
<P>Seven's hair was still undone and flowing in the bountiful sunshine that
rained down upon the planet. And B'Elanna couldn't take her eyes off of it. She
realized that it was her that had undid Seven's hair during one of her
flashbacks. </P>
<P>She was stunned at the resemblance that Seven and Claire shared. Although
Commander Chakotay would probably argue that she thought all blondes looked like
Claire. The Commander was one of the few members on board Voyager that knew
about her love affair with Claire and the heartache that she had suffered when
she disappeared. </P>
<P>In fact it was so bad that there was an unspoken rule never to speak about it
to anyone. Even Chakotay was scared to bring up the subject, so he never did.
</P>
<P>It was a chance encounter really, B'Elanna thought to herself. B'Elanna was
on a Maquis mission on Earth gathering information on Federation movements near
the Cardassian border. Chakotay wanted to make sure they didn't run into any
Starfleet vessels on their missions.</P>
<P>B'Elanna happened to run into her while she was trying to hack into the
Federation's database. Well, more precisely, Claire caught her in the act and
was going to report her to the authorities. But B'Elanna had other plans, she
knocked Claire out with a quick fist to the face and carried her to a nearby
hotel where she was to meet up with her Maquis team. </P>
<P>Whenever someone asked about the unconscious woman in her arms, B'Elanna just
said that she had fainted and she was taking her to the hospital. Surprisingly
people just nodded okay and went on their way.</P>
<P>The heat of the sunshine was really getting to B'Elanna as she had fully
drifted off to her past. Now she was the one who fainted and Seven had to pick
her up and carry her the rest of the way. Seven placed her hand on B'Elanna's
forehead to check her temperature. Worried, Seven hurried as fast as she could
towards the caves.</P>
<P>B'Elanna entered her hotel room with the unconscious woman draped over her
right shoulder. She was glad when she hit the bed and could get rid of the dead
weight. Now she was left wondering what she was going to tell her Maquis friends
when they found an unconscious woman on her bed. A beautiful one at that. </P>
<P>But she really had no choice. When the woman threatened to tell the
authorities, B'Elanna just panicked and did what she knew best, hit people. So
here she was left with very few options. Kill the woman, or tell Chakotay that
they had a hostage. She really didn't like either option. Chakotay hated taking
human hostages, especially Starfleet ones. So B'Elanna simply paced around the
room cursing at her stupidity at being caught. About an hour after the punch,
the woman started to regain consciousness. This freaked out the half-blooded
Klingon even more. Although she thought it best if she played the calm, cool and
collected kidnapper. </P>
<P>So when the woman finally woke up, B'Elanna was Miss Shadowy figure with no
relevant information to give. </P>
<P>"Where am I and what do you want with me?" The groggy woman demanded an
answer.</P>
<P>"It seems you already know the answer to that question." B'Elanna responded,
trying to confuse the young woman.</P>
<P>"What? Which one, the where or the what?" Claire had a concussion and didn't
understand anything that was happening. </P>
<P>"Both." </P>
<P>"What are you talking about. The last thing I remember is someone putting a
fist to my face." Claire was now panicking and breathing heavily.</P>
<P>"Umm yeah, sorry for that. But you threatened to tell the authorities about
me so I had to put a stop to that." B'Elanna tried to sound cold and
uncaring.</P>
<P>"What, why would I do that? I'd only do that if you were doing something
wrong. But I can't remember anything except the punch. Please let me go, I'm no
use to you." Claire pleaded.</P>
<P>Hmm. B'Elanna thought to herself. If she really didn't remember anything but
the punch then she could just release her and Chakotay would never learn about
her screw up. On the other hand if she was just lying to save her skin, B'Elanna
would probably end up in a cell somewhere being interrogated about the Maquis.
</P>
<P>"You expect me to believe that, I'm half-Klingon, not stupid." B'Elanna
retorted while crossing her arms to look at the blonde lying on her bed.</P>
<P>She was slightly taller than B'Elanna and had a body to die for. In fact
B'Elanna was extremely jealous of her for that, and that was part of the reason
for the fisticuffs earlier on. Well, one fist actually.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry, but I don't want to die. I know what you people do to prisoners."
Claire exasperated, afraid for her life.</P>
<P>"And what exactly do we people do to prisoners?" B'Elanna questioned
sarcastically, already knowing the answer.</P>
<P>"Well, you interrogate them for information, then kill them after you get
what you want." Claire seemed more than happy to answer.</P>
<P>"So that's what Starfleet's been telling you. I'll bet they also tell you
that we eat children and do all sorts of other nasty things for no reason at
all." </P>
<P>"Pretty much, except for the children eating part. So what's your point?"
Claire countered.</P>
<P>"My point is that they're all lies and you bought it, hook, line and sinker."
B'Elanna laughed.</P>
<P>"What's so funny about believing that a terrorist group like the Maquis
doesn't care about killing innocent civilians in order to get what they want."
</P>
<P>"For one thing, we don't kill innocent civilians, we kill Cardassians, and
they can all go to hell as far as I'm concerned. Secondly, you live on Earth,
where everything's all nice and safe. I, on the hand, like a lot of other people
live near the damn Cardassians who wouldn't mind if all humans were
exterminated. Well, everyone except the woman, they'd probably use them as
'comfort woman.' As they like to put it. </P>
<P>"I'm sorry you feel that way, but we have a treaty with the Cardassians now.
And that treaty's been put in jeopardy because you insist on killing them
without provocation." Claire argued.</P>
<P>"Provocation, what do you know about provocation. You sit here on Earth never
knowing what really goes on out there. You sit here listening to reports about
us killing Cardassians, but do you ever hear about what they do to us. Of course
not, because that would jeopardize the treaty you have. So don't tell me about
provocation." B'Elanna was steaming, she didn't realize how much until she saw
she was only a few feet away from the woman lying on the bed.</P>
<P>"Are you saying that the Federation purposely neglects telling us about
Cardassian crimes, because they don't want us fight back?" Claire said
skeptically.</P>
<P>"Exactly. They're afraid that if you hear the truth, then their precious
little treaty will go up in smoke. And their probably right, because enough of
us know the truth and are doing something about it." B'Elanna was now sitting on
the side of the bed, trying her hardest to convince this woman of the truth.
Although she didn't know why she cared so much.</P>
<P>"I find that hard to believe. My father is a Starfleet Captain, and if anyone
would know what it's like out there he would. Why would he lie to me?" Claire
argued while lightly touching the bruise around her left eye.</P>
<P>"He's a father, and all fathers want to protect their daughters from what
they think will hurt them. Well most fathers, or so I've heard." B'Elanna had
brought up something she wanted to forget, her dad leaving when she was still a
child. B'Elanna looked down now, hurt at what she just brought up.</P>
<P>Claire noticed this, and placed her right hand on B'Elanna's shoulder trying
to comfort the woman who had blackened her eye.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?" B'Elanna shrugged Claire's hand off of her
shoulder.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry, I just saw you were hurting and..." Claire trailed off.</P>
<P>"I don't need a shoulder to cry on if that's what you're thinking." </P>
<P>"I never said you did."</P>
<P>"Good." B'Elanna looked into the woman's eyes. "So what's you're name?"</P>
