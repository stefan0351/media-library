<p>It?s been almost two months since I first had that dream about Brooke and me. I can still recall how she sat there, grinning like the Cheshire cat itself when she woke me up that morning. I just stared at her, completely stupefied at seeing my dream-lover sitting on my bed. She was wearing the most mischievous look I?ve ever seen, and for several excruciating seconds I feared that I might have called out her name in my sleep. I could literally hear the blood rush to my cheeks. My heart was hammering away in my chest; it surprised me that she didn?t seem to hear it. Hell, I was surprised that my Mom didn?t hear it, and she was downstairs in the kitchen!</p>
<p>I don?t think I?ve ever been more relieved than when she grinned even wider and asked me who my late-night visitor had been. Whew! She didn?t know. That was a good thing. Note the "was" here.</p>
<p>The thing is, I didn?t just have that single dream. They continue to occur, returning almost every night. The plot, if you can call it that, is always the same. The only difference is that we seem to get a little further every time. I?ve actually caught myself recalling the dream in the morning, counting kisses and touches. Sure enough, there is always a few more kisses, a little more touching or a little more skin covered by our hands every time.</p>
<p>I fear the night when the dream completes itself. I fear it because I might actually call out her name then, giving myself away in the process.</p>
<p>Confused as I might be by this whole mess, I must admit that I miss the dreams when they don?t come to me. I value them in some way. I always feel safe, loved and protected during them, and I think I?m finally beginning to understand why.</p>
<p>The fact that I?m gay doesn?t really bother me. It doesn?t change who I am, right? In truth, I must confess that I never saw it coming. It just happened I guess. No, what bothers me is the fact that I have fallen, and fallen hard, for my arch nemesis, my adversary and my contradiction. Figures. I couldn?t have fallen for someone just a tad less unreachable, like Nicole for instance? Of course not! No, I simply had to fall head-over-heels in love with Brooke McQueen. The woman who not only represents everything I have fought throughout High School, but is also my stepsister-to-be! Ugh...sometimes I really hate my life.</p>
<p><b>May 28<sup>th</sup> 4:35 Am</b></p>
<p>Thank God I just woke up! Another minute and I would have called out her name for sure! My dream-lover brought me so close this time. Hm, "dream-lover". Very suitable term when you think about it, isn?t it?</p>
<p>It?s strange. When I wake up I can still feel her hands on my body and her lips on mine. It?s like they?re burned onto me somehow. The dreams are so intense. My hair is plastered to my skin and I?m covered in a fine sheet of sweat when I return to the real world.</p>
<p>I?d kill for a cold shower right now. I can?t do that though. It would just wake Brooke, and I?d probably have a pretty hard time explaining why I need a shower at this time of the day.</p>
<p><b>May 28<sup>th</sup> 10:30 Pm</b></p>
<p>Great! Wonderful! Marvelous! Just fan-fucking-tastic! Like dreaming about her during the night wasn?t bad enough, now I have to fantasize about her during the day as well! Perfect! Just what the doctor proscribed, more sexual frustration!</p>
<p>Brooke came home from cheerleading practice this afternoon. I was in the kitchen, standing at the calendar and trying to figure out how many days we had left until summer vacation when she walked in. She was still in her Glamazon uniform, which looks very good on her might I add. She greeted me with a smile, not much odd about that. We have been getting along better after all.</p>
<p>Anyway, she grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and placed it on the counter. Then she proceeded to STRETCH OUT! Right under my goddamn nose! Just moving that luscious body of hers around in the most impossible angles and sensual postures.</p>
<p>She leaned against the counter, placed her feet apr. three feet away from it and arched her back to stretch properly. And she GRUNTED! Not a big grunt, just small noise. Had I been sitting I?m absolutely positive that my jaw would have smashed against the floor.</p>
<p>I swear, the look on her face, the way she arched her back and the sound she made. It was like looking at Dream-Brooke, except this version was clothed of course. Dream-Brooke had made that exact noise just last night. She did it when I closed my mouth around her left nipple. Needless to say witnessing the "real thing" doing this, my mind flooded with images of my sexual escapades in what I have recently dubbed "The Twilight Zone".</p>
<p>I mean really. As if something like that would ever happen any place but The Twilight Zone? What is it Satan calls me again? Oh yeah, got it now. Spam McFearsome and Queen B McQueen making love in real life? I don?t think so.</p>
<p>But hey, a girl can dream, can?t she?</p>
<p>That?s what I?m gonna do anyway. Might put on a gag before going to bed though. Don?t want her to hear me if my dream-lover and I "consummate our relationship" tonight.</p>
