<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 1 -->

<p>It was Monday.  Brooke hated Monday's.  She firmly believed that Monday's
were a horrible way to spend one seventh of your life.  Then, to top it all
off, it was gym class.  Brooke was beginning to hate gym class.  Sighing
dramatically she yanked her top over her head and sat down reaching into her
gym bag.  As she yanked-and yank she did-her tank top out another shirt, a
red one, came out with it.  It was Sam's, Jane had caught Brooke just as she
was going out the door and shoved-alright gently handed-the shirt to her
asking her if she would be able to give it to Sam.  Brooke sighed again, the
shirt smelled like jasmine, just like Sam, and it was red, Sam loved red.</p>

<p>Pulling her own shirt over her head Brooke looked up and across the room.
Sam was standing on the other side of the locker room talking to Carmyn and
gesturing emphatically.  From the way Sam was gesturing at Carmyn's top half
Brooke guessed she was trying to bum a shirt off the girl seeing as she was
standing there half dressed.  Half dressed, Brooke thought to herself
longingly.  Half dressed was a good look on Sam she decided.  Letting out a
frustrated sigh the cheerleader picked up the red shirt that had been lying
next to her and balled it up.  Then, taking one last look at Sam she drew
her arm back and threw the balled up piece of cloth in Sam's direction
hitting her with it squarely on the head.</p>

<p>The locker room went quiet as the cottony red ball arched across the room;
everyone was following its path from point A to point B waiting for the
super bitch fight they were sure was going to occur after it reached its
destination.  The animosity between Brooke McQueen and Sam McPherson was
legendary-they were like Superman and Lex Luther, Xena and Callisto, Pinky
and the Brain-and now Brooke had just shot a projectile at her nemesis.
Chaos was sure to ensue and they were all eagerly awaiting it, after all
Brooke and Sam had practically turned hostility into an art form.  They were
poetry in motion really.</p>

<p>Sam slowly reached up and peeled the shirt from over her head,  then equally
as slowly she turned around and looked in the direction the t-shirt bomb had
came from.  What she found was Brooke staring directly at her eliminating
all other possible options.  The blonde was the guilty party and seemed to
want Sam to know it.  This confused Sam, however, as she looked at the
expression on Brooke's face the ball-of-bitch that had been building up in
her as the shirt whacked her up side the head drained away with
comprehension.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Sam asked calmly, she felt that she had to address the
situation verbally seeing as the entire locker room was watching them, and
she got a slight kick out of the fact that her unruffled reaction seemed to
leave everyone else in the room confused and slightly dazed.</p>

<p>"Your mom gave it to me...to give to you...which I did," Brooke mumbled then
looked away.  Her eyes had been locked on Sam's chest as she spoke and she
knew that she couldn't keep that up for much longer before somebody noticed.</p>

<p>"Did she tell you to hurl it at me?" Sam asked trying to contain a smile.
She knew what this was all about now, she had seen the way Brooke was
looking at her.</p>

<p>"No, I came up with that myself," Brooke muttered before bending down to tie
her shoes, effectively ignoring Sam for the rest of the allotted change
time.</p>

<p>Bouncing on her feet lightly Sam took the shirt that now rested in her hands
and pulled it over her head.  Once she got it on, she rolled her shoulder
around and bent her neck from side to side before clapping her hands
together energetically.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Carm asked looking at Sam oddly.  She had been acting like a
sugared up eight year old for the past couple of days, it was all very
bizarre.  That worried Carmyn because the last time Sam had acted this
bizarrely was when she had gotten together with Brooke and Carm wasn't sure
if she could handle another surprise of that magnitude.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded bounding some more.  "I'm just ready to go, you know,
burn some energy," she went on.  "It's all good."</p>

<p>Carm nodded in response, but somehow she got the impression that was NOT
indeed all good.</p>

<p>
'Spandex, it's a privilege not a right,' Sam thought to herself as she
bounced on her feet a little, "and she is certainly privileged," she
continued as she stared at Brooke.  She broke her gaze momentarily when the
teacher began to speak, but just as quickly her eyes returned to their
previous task which consisted completely of staring at Brooke's ass with an
almost scholarly interest.  She bounded some more.  Then rubbed her hands
together.  Then bounded some more.</p>

<p>"Ouch, Carm!" Sam whispered harshly in response to her friend knocking her
on the arm.</p>

<p>"McPherson, Ferrara...make mouths shut now!" the teacher called from in front
of them.  Sam and Carm both smiled politely and nodded.</p>

<p>"You were staring," Carm whispered softly trying to minimize all mouth
action.</p>

<p>"Was not," Sam responded, however even as the words left her mouth her eyes
were back on Brooke and she was definitely staring.</p>

<p>Carmyn knocked her again.</p>

<p>"Ferrara!  Nobody beats anyone up around here without my explicit
permission.  Understand?" the teacher asked darkly.</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am," Carmyn responded before shooting Sam a nasty look.  Sam was the
one suddenly stricken with a severe case of 'dirty-old-man' disease and she
was the one that got yelled at.  She just couldn't see how that worked out
on the karmic cycle.  On top of that the look had absolutely no effect on
Sam since she had immediately returned to her previous activities the moment
the teacher had spoken.  Carm sighed, it was going to be a long day.</p>
