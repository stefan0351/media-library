<!-- Bedside Vigil -->

<p>Nightmares are never so vivid as when you're awake.  At least
that's what Brooke decided idly as she sat by Sam's bedside six days
later.  And that was what it this whole thing seemed to be to her
too, a living nightmare.  And she desperately wished someone would
wake her the Hell up sometime soon because she felt like she was
dying.  </p>

<p>She held Sam's limp hand as she watched the ventilator pump air into
Sam's collapsed lung and she listened to the somewhat reassuring beep
of the heart monitor by Sam's head.  Brooke both loved and loathed
that damn machine.  On one hand it told her Sam was still there,
still holding on, however tenuously to life, but on the other hand it
was a glaring reminder of the horrible, brutal reality they now lived
with.  It was killing her to see the normally spirited brunette lying
there so pale and still.</p>

<p>"Come on, Sam, gotta wake up soon, everybody misses you,"
Brooke continued her self-appointed job of talking to Sam even though
her voice had given out a few days earlier.  She managed to either
avoid school all together or got out early to stay at the hospital as
much as possible.  After the first few days, Mike and Jane realized
that there was no detering Brooke from Sam's side.  They barely got
her to go home most of the time.  </p>

<p>To Brooke, home was where she went to change her clothes, shower, and
sometimes sleep if the hospital staff were being jerks and actually
made her go home.  But most of the time they didn't bother.  They
knew a futile battle when they saw one as well.  She had a cot in
Sam's room and they made sure she ate regularly.  Besides, being home
was too hard for Brooke because it was Sam's home too.  Even though
Sam and Jane had only moved in less than a year ago, Sam's influence
was all over the house.  Little knick-knacks, pictures from Sam's
childhood, silly things would remind Brooke of something Sam said or
did and it was like reliving that night all over again.  So Brooke
simply avoided home too.</p>

<p>The few times she did go home to sleep, she ended up in Sam's
room, lying in her bed crying.  The bed smelled of Sam and it was a
comforting smell to Brooke.  She decided that the hospital room was
too antiseptic and brought a couple of Sam's favorite things over to
make it more familiar for when Sam woke up.  And Brooke had no doubt
that she would.  She brought in a blanket, Sam's favorite pillow, and
a photo of Sam's dad, a radio and Sam's favorite CDs.  Other than
that Brooke couldn't think of anything else to do but talk.  So she
did, about everything.</p>

<p>She started by apologizing for the accident and promised to
apologize again when Sam was conscious and vowed to somehow make it
up to the comatose girl.  Then she told Sam how she and Harrison had
had a long talk about what happened between the three of them and how
guilty the two of them felt and what Nicole had done.  Brooke asked
Sam if she knew that Nicole was the driver, and she figured, somehow,
Sam did.  She talked about their childhood, what she knew about Sam's
at least and she opened up to Sam about her mother and why she like
Jane so much and thanked Sam for being able to share such a wonderful
mother.</p>

<p>She talked about Lily and Josh being married, (who smoked
what and where?) Mary Cherry and B. Ho (Huh? That's a funny one, huh,
Sam.  Great material for the paper) and how George had had to
transfer to yet another school because his parents were moving yet
again.  He'd been by to visit once but that was it.  He apologized to
Brooke but she just lit into him about everything, the way she felt
he'd hurt Sam and he never came back.  Brooke apologized to Sam about
that (gotta watch my temper, huh, Sammy?).  </p>

<p>"Anyway, Dad went back to work today.  He wasn't happy about
it but Mom and I insisted.  Mom's at home taking care of Mac; she's
got a little cold.  Nothing to worry about though.  She's fine.  A
little fighter; like her big sister Sam.  Right, Sam?" Not really
expecting an answer but kind of hoping, Brooke sighed in
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Gotta tell you Sam, not liking this silent treatment thing
you've got going on although it's nice to get a word in edgewise for
a change.  I never realized how much you monopolize conversations,"
she joked hoping for a challenge.  Again she sighed
disappointed.  "Just kidding.  I'd really love to hear your voice
right now.  Even if it was to yell at me for what's happened." She
looked at the still figure beside her and figured she was in her own
private Hell having to watch Sam like this.  She wondered what she
did to deserve it; maybe it was God's way of punishing her for her
feelings for Sam.  But she knew that she'd rather spend the rest of
her days fighting with the sharp-tongued journalist than watch her
wither away like this.</p>

<p>"Mom said she'll be by later after Carmen comes by to take
care of Mac.  Yup got us a regular little au pair with Carmen.  Dad
too, he'll be by after work I mean, not an au pair.  Josh and Lily
send their love but they have to go straight to work after school.
Josh works at a record store and Lily got a job at Target, but I
probably all ready told you that, huh?  Sorry if I'm repeating
myself.  Anyway, Harrison will be by later, he's going to bring my
schoolwork by.  Can you believe we're almost senoirs?  A few weeks
more and summer'll be here.  Although if you keep up with the
Sleeping Beauty routine you'll end up a junior again.  Can't let us
all get ahead of you Sam, you'll never hear the end of it."</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry and her father, uhm, whatever, not even going to go
there although I know you'd get a big laugh out of that one, are
fighting Cherry Cherry for part of the Cherry-Estrada estate.
Something about Sweet Honey Chile, yes that's his name, he's a drag
queen Sam, you'd love it, sueing Cherry Cherry for like, half her
earnings because he raised Mary Cherry's twin without child support.
And, oh God, Mary Cherry's twin B. Ho.  What a spaz!  Although, the
whole splitting of the egg and sperm thing sure explains a lot about
Mary Cherry.  Dip too many times in the gene pool and you're
eventually going to bang your head on the shallow end." Brooke
laughed but it came out as more of a sigh.</p>

<p>"I can almost hear you laughing but please, Sam, wake up soon
so I can hear it for real.  I've never seen you so still for so long,
not even when you're sleeping," Brooke caught herself as she realized
she just admitted to at some point in time watching Sam sleep and
blushed despite the fact she was alone in the room.</p>

<p>"Not that I spend time watching you sleep or anything,
because that would just be creepy, right?  Aside from right now, that
is.  It's just, a few days before prom you fell asleep on the couch
and I found you there all curled up and you looked so peaceful and
cute and..." she caught herself again put her head in her free hand and
sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"I'm pathetic, you know that?  Well, of course you do, you've
only spent you're entire life trying to point it out in some way or
another.  Not that I hold it against you or anything, cuz I don't.
Bygones and all that.  But here I am, watching you slip further and
further away in your coma and I'm hitting on you, telling you how
irresistiblely cute you are when you sleep.  Utterly pathetic,
Brooke," she chastized herself as she laid her head on the bed beside
Sam.  </p>

<p>"I'm so tired, Sam.  I don't think I've had a decent night's
sleep since you left.  I keep reliving that awful moment.  I miss you
so much.  I need you, Sammy.  Please come back soon," Brooke asked as
she drifted off to sleep.</p>
