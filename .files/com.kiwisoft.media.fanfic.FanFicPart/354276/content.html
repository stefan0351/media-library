<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 27 Rough water -->

<P>Voyager approached the gravitational river on schedule, but most of the
senior staff members were not on the bridge as they neared the event horizon.
B’Elanna was in engineering, Seven was in Astrometrics monitoring the dark
matter, and Tom Paris and Harry Kim were both taking a mandatory rest after
pulling a double the night before. The captain decided to wait an additional
eight hours so that Tom and Harry could come on duty. She was angry with Tom,
but he was the best pilot on the ship, and she wanted him at the helm. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several hours before the ‘big event’ B’Elanna went to Astrometrics to see
Seven. She had waited while Seven regenerated before they began their shift, and
had promised to meet her for their late afternoon break. Seven had said that she
needed some advice, but wouldn’t elaborate.</P>
<P>Seven turned when she heard the door open, and smiled when she saw her wife
heading toward her with a small container. Seven was glad she worked alone,
because she could properly greet her beloved.</P>
<P>"I was not aware that we were having a picnic," Seven said as she tried to
snatch the package.</P>
<P>"Not a picnic," B’Elanna said as she yanked the container away from Seven’s
grabby hands. "Just a snack for my fussy wife."</P>
<P>"Then give it to me before I show you how fussy I can be," Seven said
menacingly.</P>
<P>"Oh, trust me, I know how fussy you can be." B’Elanna held the container
behind her back.</P>
<P>"Then kiss me." Seven smiled and moved against B’Elanna. She wrapped the
smaller woman in her arms, using the closeness to reach behind her and grab the
food container.</P>
<P>"Hey?" B’Elanna protested weakly. She smiled as she watched Seven rip open
the package.</P>
<P>"Nuts?" Seven asked happily when she saw the contents.</P>
<P>"You were craving those crunchy nuts we used to get down by the lake."
B’Elanna moved closer and picked up one of the nuts and fed it to Seven. "I had
to taste every damn nut in Neelix’s kitchen to find one that tasted like your
favorite."</P>
<P>"Mmm." Seven closed her eyes, savoring the flavor. She had been craving the
sweet nuts since they had left the planet, but she hadn’t been brave enough to
ask Neelix to find a substitute.</P>
<P>"Good?" B’Elanna smiled. "You owe me, love. I can’t tell you how disgusting
most of the nuts I tried were."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said sincerely, then took and handful of the nuts and put
them all into her mouth.</P>
<P>"So, what did you need?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Seven’s smile disappeared. "I am… experiencing… apprehension, about… talking
with the captain."</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded. "I can understand that, but I don’t think you have to worry
about that."</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven reached out and took another nut.</P>
<P>"I…ah…already spoke to her," B’Elanna confessed.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven demanded. "You forbid me to confront…<I>him</I>, and yet you
approached Kathryn?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna flinched. It wasn’t the tone, or the fact that she knew she was
wrong, it was hearing Seven call the captain by her first name. It was so
intimate.</P>
<P>"You didn’t think I could handle it, did you?" Seven asked. Her eyes shined
as tears welled up. "How could you?" Pain covered Seven’s pale features.</P>
<P>"No, Seven…it wasn’t like that," B’Elanna said as she took Seven’s hands in
hers. She felt a lump in her throat as she watched a tear slide down Seven’s
cheek.</P>
<P>"How was it?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"I meant to tell you last night, it just slipped my mind," B’Elanna said,
digging the hole deeper.</P>
<P>"Last night?" Seven pulled away from B’Elanna. "You did this last night?"</P>
<P>"That doesn’t matter," B’Elanna said. "What matters is that she called me to
talk to her, and it just came up."</P>
<P>"You promised me," Seven said. She turned and walked away. "Please
leave."</P>
<P>"Seven, please," B’Elanna pleaded.</P>
<P>"Go," Seven ordered. She was hurt, and angry, and couldn’t believe that
B’Elanna would break a promise to her.</P>
<P>She turned to leave, wanting to let Seven calm down, but she stopped. "No,"
B’Elanna said. "I won’t walk out with you thinking I betrayed you. Damn it,
Seven. Turn around and talk to me."</P>
<P>For a moment neither moved, Seven stared at the wall, and B’Elanna stared at
Seven’s back, looking for some sign that she would give in. Finally Seven’s
shoulders dropped, and B’Elanna knew she would talk to her.</P>
<P>"Why, Be’nal?" Seven whispered.</P>
<P>The pain in Seven voice cut into B’Elanna’s chest, so physical was the injury
that B’Elanna almost stumbled. "The captain called me to talk to me, and it just
came up," B’Elanna said, her voice barely a whisper, pain making her voice
crack.</P>
<P>Seven turned, pulled by the pain in her wife’s voice. "You are…hurt," Seven
said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded, unable to respond.</P>
<P>The doors hissed open and Harry Kim came in, yawning.</P>
<P>"Get out," B’Elanna and Seven turned and yelled in unison.</P>
<P>Harry’s eyes widened and he practically ran as he spun and left.</P>
<P>Seven spoke first. "You promised."</P>
<P>"We were already talking, she… she was telling me how happy she was for us.
It just seemed like the perfect time." B’Elanna knew that it had been a good
time to talk to Janeway, and she wondered briefly why Seven was so upset. Then
she realized, she had never broken her word to Seven, ever, not in any matter,
until now. She realized she could have waited, could have let Seven bring it up
in her own time. "Oh, god, Seven I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you."</P>
<P>Seven saw the regret in B’Elanna’s eyes. She took a deep breath and closed
her eyes. She thought about what had happened, about B’Elanna, and how much she
loved her, trusted her. Then she thought about the captain. It would be just
like Janeway to begin a conversation that would lead to a discussion of
feelings, and it would be awkward to avoid the issue and bring it up again
later.</P>
<P>B’Elanna edged closer, needing closeness.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes opened. "No, B’Elanna. I am sorry. I know you would not
intentionally break your word to me. If it came up, you should have taken
advantage of the opportunity."</P>
<P>B’Elanna closed her eyes and released a sigh, and tears rolled down her
cheeks. "Thank you," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Shh," Seven said as she wrapped her arms around B’Elanna. The Klingon
collapsed into Seven, clinging to her.</P>
<P>"I’m so sorry." </P>
<P>"No, do not apologize. You have done nothing wrong," Seven assured her. "I am
being…hormonal."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "Well, so am I."</P>
<P>"How did the conversation go?" Seven asked without letting B’Elanna go.</P>
<P>"Great, actually," B’Elanna said and then explained in detail.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway stared at the forward viewscreen, amazed by what she saw.
"Incredible," she said, shaking her head. The gravitational river was in front
of them, and unlike most anomalies involving gravity, this one was quite
visible. The light from the surrounding stars was bending toward the river, and
there were flickers of light as any meteorites and space debris were being
sucked into the river and being shot across the length of the disturbance.</P>
<P>"It’s beautiful," Chakotay said, his eyes sparkling. He was an anthropologist
by choice, but still a scientist at heart, and he was seeing something he had
never even heard of. "I thought only a black hole could bend light like that."
The surrounding light was being pulled from every source making the length of
the river look like a series of pinwheels.</P>
<P>"Take us in Tom," Janeway said calmly. Inside she was adding another notch on
her professional belt, one more first for <I>Voyager</I> and her crew. "Nice and
steady."</P>
<P>"Aye ma’am," he said as he headed into it.</P>
<P>The ship bucked as it was rocked by the pounding gravity. Tuvok was thrown to
the floor, landing next to Harry Kim. The rest of the bridge crew were already
seated, still, Janeway had to cling to the arm of her chair to keep from joining
Harry and Tuvok on the floor. It wasn’t especially graceful or elegant, but it
worked in a pinch.</P>
<P>"Mr. Paris, I’d appreciate it if you’d keep my ship in one piece. We don’t
have warranty service out here," she said as the ship was tossed in the opposite
direction.</P>
<P>"I'm trying, captain," Tom said as he fought to bring the ship into the
safety of the gravitational river. "Okay," he said as the ship stopped pitching
and settled into a bouncing rhythm.</p>
<p>"Tom," Chakotay said as he loosened
his grip on his chair arms. "Can we looked forward to this for the next fourteen
hours?"</p>
<p>"No," Janeway answered for him. "We only anticipate rough travel
through the rapids. We should clear them in about an hour and a
half."</p>
<p>Tuvok raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment. He was already feeling
space sick.</p>
<p>***</P>
<p>In Astrometrics, the first impact knocked Seven to the floor. As she
tried to stand, the second lurch sent her sprawling onto her backside. She sat
there until the ship stopped flinging in every direction and began to rattle and
shake as they entered the rapids. Only then did she stand and make her way back
to the console and check the flight path. True, she knew what it would tell her,
but she liked to be certain.</p>
<p>She rubbed her forehead and rested her
weight against the console and decided that she may have to torture B’Elanna.
They had completely patched things up before the Klingon left for engineering,
but B’Elanna had never mentioned anything about pregnancy causing space
sickness. B’Elanna was in serious trouble.</p>
<p>***</P>
<P>An hour and a half later, B’Elanna was more than ready for the shaking to
stop. Most of her precious tools had been rattling obnoxiously inside their
cabinets the entire time and she was about to throw every tool on the ship out
an airlock and replicate new ones when they finished crossing the gravitational
rapids. One final lurch and the ship settled into its normal smooth
flight.</p>
<p>"It’s about damn time," Torres said to no one in particular, then
turned to her Vulcan officer. "Vorik, run a complete diagnostic and see if
anything shook apart."</p>
<p>Vorik nodded and went to his own comm station to
begin the check. He didn’t point out that starships were designed for rough
travel and the likelihood that <I>Voyager</I> would actually fly apart at the
seams from some minor bouncing was quite rare. He also knew from experience such
an astute observation would not be taken well by the volatile half-Klingon Chief
Engineer.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p>Seven felt awful. She was nauseous, and sore, and worst of all, she
didn’t have B’Elanna there to hold her. On Jusari Prime, when she had
experienced morning sickness, she took great comfort from B’Elanna’s tender
devotion. Dealing with the space sickness alone just made her feel worse. To
make it even more aggravating, now she was getting cramps.</p>
<p>She went to
the console on the far side of the room and began checking for any sign that the
sensors had been vibrated out of alignment when she suddenly felt the room spin.
She grabbed the console, wondering why the bridge hadn’t given any warning, then
she realized it wasn’t the room that was moving. She slid down the console and
rested her head on her bent knees and tried to take slow breaths. She knew she
had to monitor the ship’s progression through the gravitational river, but she
couldn’t seem to stand. Space sickness was far more disabling than morning
sickness. At least she wasn’t vomiting. She hated that particular human bodily
function.</p>
<p>***</P>
<p>Kathryn Janeway smiled, hoping all of her teeth were still intact and
hadn’t been shaken out of her mouth. "Ensign Kim, I want a ship wide diagnostic
and damage reports from all divisions," she ordered.</p>
<p>"Aye, ma’am," he
said as he straightened his uniform.</p>
<p>"What is that?" Neelix asked as he
pointed to the viewscreen. There were hundreds of meteorites and chunks of
debris in the surrounding space and all of it seemed to be matching
<I>Voyager’s</I> course exactly.</p>
<p>"That is flotsam, just like us." Janeway
smiled ruefully at the Talaxian who had asked to witness the unique anomaly from
the unused science station on the bridge. "That debris field was all of those
tiny points of light we saw being sucked into the river. Inside here, we're all
moving the same speed. Just along for the ride."</p>
<p>"It’s not nearly as
beautiful in here," Neelix noted.</p>
<p><I>* "Seven of Nine to the
bridge."*</I></p>
<p>"Go ahead, Seven," Janeway said.</p>
<p><I>*"Captain...
"*</I> Seven paused, and her voice was odd, disconnected.</p>
<p>"Seven, is
everything all right?" Janeway stood like she always did when something bothered
her and she needed to feel like she was doing something.</p>
<p><I>*"No,"*</I>
Seven said, her voice filled with disgust. *<I>"I am unable to access the
consoles, and I need someone to replace me in Astrometrics."*</I></p>
<p>"What’s
wrong?" Chakotay asked. Behind him Neelix turned around and his wrung his yellow
hands.</p>
<p><I>*"I am experiencing extreme space sickness,"*</I> Seven
responded bitterly. <I>*"I cannot reach the console."*<BR></I><BR>"Where are
you?" Chakotay asked.</p>
<p>There was long pause before Seven sheepishly
answered. <I>*"On the floor."*</I></p>
<p>"I'll send someone right up," the
captain promised. She would have laughed at the comical image of the elegant
exdrone sprawled across the floor, but there was more than irritation in Seven’s
voice. There was fear. "Seven, I want you to report to sickbay, on the
double."</p>
<p><I>*"Yes, captain. Seven of Nine out."*</I></p>
<p>Seven never
agreed to go to sickbay, not without an argument, and her agreement now made
Kathryn very nervous.</p>
<p>"Captain," Neelix said. "I’d be happy to go down
and take over for Seven," he offered.</p>
<p>"I'm worried too," Janeway said as
she smiled knowingly. She knew the Talaxian could run the Astrometrics scanners
in a pinch, but the concern on his furry features gave away his real intent.
"Go, and instead of baby-sitting Astrometrics, make sure she gets to sickbay.
We’ll have Harry monitor the scanners from ops."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Neelix said
as he hurried to the turbolift.</p>
<p>At the helm, Tom Paris smiled. He figured
Seven wasn’t space sick as much as she was just good old fashioned angry. Harry
Kim had told him about walking in on Seven and B’Elanna in the middle of a huge
fight. Obviously his plan had worked perfectly. B’Elanna had returned home
sporting a hickey, and Seven had gone ballistic. B’Elanna probably tried to
explain that she must have bumped into something in one of the Jeffrey’s tubes.
The Borg must have refused to believe her. He was sure that they would both have
been too upset to even consider checking for any other cause. Tom shook his
head, and smiled; it was almost too easy.</p>
<p>Neelix asked the computer for Seven’s location for the second time, and
she was still in Astrometrics. It was just like her to wait to be relieved
before leaving her post, he thought. The doors opened and he saw her on floor,
leaning against the console with her eyes closed. She was paler than he had ever
seen her, and that was saying a lot considering he had seen her when she was
completely Borg.</p>
<p>"Seven?" He ran to her, kneeling and feeling her face,
she was cold, and clammy, and her eyes didn’t open when he touched
her.</p>
<p>"Mister Neelix," she said without opening her eyes. "Could you
assist me? I cannot seem to stand."</p>
<p>"Neelix to sickbay, medical
emergency, transport Seven of Nine directly to sickbay." He leaned back but she
didn’t dematerialize as expected.</p>
<p><I>*"Mister Neelix?"*</I> the Doctor’s
voice came over Neelix’s comm badge. <I>*"We can’t get a lock on Seven. What is
the problem?"*<BR></I><BR>"Doctor," Seven answered. "I am experiencing space
sickness. I am reporting to sickbay now." She opened her eyes and tried to
stand, but was only successful when Neelix pulled her to her
feet.</p>
<p>"Easy," Neelix said as he wrapped his arm around her
waist.</p>
<p><I>*"Seven?"* </I>the Doctor asked. *<I>"If you’re sure you’re all
right, I’ll let Mister Neelix bring you in. All the people with similar
complaints are still emptying out of my sickbay. This rough ride has taken its
toll on the crew."*<BR></I><BR>"Acceptable," Seven said as she nodded toward the
door. She wished B’Elanna were there. Her wife’s touch was much more soothing
than Neelix’s despite his sincere concern and the way his grip was gentle, yet
firm.</p>
<p>"Just a little farther," Neelix said when they were almost to the
turbolift. "You know, space sickness causes some nasty cramping, and from the
way you’re holding your stomach, I'll bet you’d like some nice hot tea to settle
that tummy."</p>
<p>"You would lose that wager," Seven responded. "In fact I
believe you would end up wearing your tea," she added, remembering the time
B’Elanna had tried giving her tea for her nausea on the planet. Even Lana’s
Klingon reflexes hadn’t been fast enough to help her avoid the tea on its return
journey. </p>
<p>"He he he..." Neelix giggled. "At least your sense of humor in
intact," he said.</p>
<p>Neelix’s unique laugh was a comfortingly familiar
sound. Seven really did like the silly man. All thought of comfort left Seven’s
mind as she dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>"Lana," Seven yelled as she double over
and clutched her belly.</p>
<p>Neelix reacted instantly, drafting the nearest
crewmember. "Lieutenant Larson, come here," he ordered.</p>
<p>Larson jogged
over to him, concerned by the display. All of the crew in the corridor had
stopped what they were doing and moved closer to offer assistance.</p>
<p>"Grab
her," Neelix ordered as he moved to her side. The two men lifted her and hurried
to the turbolift.</p>
<p>"This is not space sickness," Seven said. Her teeth
were tightly clinched and she was now sweating profusely.</p>
<p>"Easy, Seven,"
Neelix said. "We’ll get you to sick bay in no time." They stepped into the
turbolift and Larson ordered the lift to sickbay, adding the emergency express
command that kept the lift from stopping for other passengers.</p>
<p>By the
time Larson and Neelix carried Seven through the doors to sickbay she was
convulsing.</p>
<p>"Doctor!" Neelix yelled.</p>
<p>The hologram turned and
instantly hurried to them. "What happened?" he demanded. "This is not space
sickness."</p>
<p>"I don’t know," Neelix said as they put her onto a biobed.
Larson quickly left, not sure of what to say or do to help.</p>
<p>"I want
B’Elanna." Seven tried to sit up.</p>
<p>"Lay down," the Doctor snapped. "Hold
still and let me scan you."</p>
<p>"Easy," Neelix said as he took her hand and
patted it. "I’ll get B’Elanna in just a second. Let’s find out what’s wrong so
we know what to tell her."</p>
<p>"This can’t be," the Doctor said as he stared
at his tricorded.</p>
<p>"What?" Seven and Neelix demanded in unison.</p>
<p>"No
wonder the transporter could get a lock on you," the hologram said as he began
gathering equipment and piling it onto the empty bed next to Seven’s. The other
crewmembers had already left, their space sickness going away once the ship
stopped bouncing.</p>
<p>Seven screamed, and hugged her belly, the pain making
her see red and white sparks behind her closed eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it Doctor?"
Neelix asked.</p>
<p>"The fetus...it’s growing at a rate... it’s ... for every
second Seven experiences, the fetus is maturing the equivalent of 186.2
seconds." The Doctor hurried to a storage locker and removed a large
device.</p>
<p>"The planet, Jusari Prime," Seven said. "That is the exact
temporal differential."</p>
<p>"Well," the Doctor said, "apparently this fetus
misses Jusari Prime. It’s gone back to that temporal metabolism."</p>
<p>Neelix
let go of Seven’s hand long enough to tap his comm badge then reached down and
took her hand again. "Neelix to Lieutenant Torres," he said quietly, not wanting
to disturb the Doctor who already seemed quite disturbed.</p>
<p><I>*"What can I
do for you, Neelix?"*</I> B’Elanna asked.</p>
<p>"B’Elanna, you need to get to
sick bay, now." Neelix looked down at Seven. She still had her eyes tightly
closed, unable to do much more than hold her belly. "It’s Seven," Neelix
explained.</p>
<p><I>*"I’m on my way,"*</I> she said, her voice cracking.
<I>*"What’s wrong?"*</I></p>
<p>Seven chose that moment to sit straight up and
let out a blood curdling scream. Until that moment, Neelix hadn’t truly known
what that term meant.</p>
<p><I>*"Seven?"*</I> B’Elanna yelled over the comm
badge.</p>
<p>"Computer, deactivate comm signal," the Doctor ordered. "Neelix,
we don’t need Lieutenant Torres listening to this. She will be worried enough as
it. Now, get over here and help me." He was moving a large device next to the
bed. It was on rollers, and he had to retrieve it from a rarely used locker. He
had never used the device in his entire existence.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"
Seven asked as she fought to get a full breath. Her belly felt like it was
tearing in half, and each time she tried to speak, she felt like she was
suffocating because she had to stop panting.</p>
<p>"The fetus is maturing too
quickly." The Doctor plugged in the device. "The only reason it hasn’t
spontaneously aborted is because of the neonatal nanoprobes. The Borg technology
is protecting the fetus, expanding the womb nano-seconds before the fetus fills
the space."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Seven asked again.</p>
<p>"Seven," he
explained. "You won’t survive much longer under these conditions. I’m going to
abort the fetus." He patted her arm, and tried to look comforting.</p>
<p>"No,"
Seven said as she pushed his hands away. "You will not harm my child. I forbid
it."</p>
<p>"Seven, the fetus is drawing all of your energy and trying to rip
you in half. There’s no other choice." The Doctor went back to setting up the
machine.</p>
<p>"No," Seven ordered. "I am the patient and I refuse to undergo
any procedure that will harm my child." She was gasping between words, the
struggle to speak taxing what little energy she had left. "You cannot do this. I
refuse."</p>
<p>"Doctor, you can’t do this. She just told you not to," Neelix
said as he tried to grab the hologram’s arm. "It’s her right to choose… you
can’t do this against her wishes."</p>
<p>"She doesn’t know what she’s saying,"
the Doctor yelled. "I am the physician. She’ll thank me when this is over." He
shoved Neelix aside and grabbed a long tubular device from the rolling
table.</p>
<p>"Computer, deactivate Emergency Medical Hologram," Neelix ordered.
The hologram gave him an angry glare as he dematerialized.</p>
<p>"Lana," Seven
yelled. "Why isn’t she here?"</p>
<p>"She’s coming," Neelix said. He didn’t know
what to do, he wasn’t trained to treat more than a broken leg, but before he
could ponder that issue, the Doctor rematerialized.</p>
<p>"Mister Neelix, get
out of my sickbay." The hologram went back to the rolling table and grabbed the
device.</p>
<p>"No," Neelix said as he blocked the Doctor from Seven. The fur on
his face stood on end and the tuft of hair on his head seemed to fluff. "Stay
away from her."</p>
<p>The Doctor swatted the Talaxian away as if he were a fly,
using his superior strength to fling Neelix away. "Seven, this will only take a
second. Hold very still," he said as he moved closer. "Trust me, this is for the
best."</P>
