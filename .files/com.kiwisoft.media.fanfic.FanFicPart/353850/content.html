<p>It was an odd sensation, waking up wrapped around somebody.  The urge to
stretch was almost overwhelming and Tess moved to pull her arms above her
head and straighten her legs when she found that one hand was tangled in
glossy brown hair, and the other gripped desperately by a delicate shaped
hand.  Curiously, Tess blinked as the morning light fell on her face noting
that the curtains had been left open last night, and, though Tess had never
thought about it, she now vaguely realized that the Evans' house faced east.
  The Evans' house.  Tess finally realized where she was. And who she was
holding.  But Tess was surprised to find that there was no awkwardness or
discomfort in knowing that she was holding a peaceful Liz Parker in her
arms.  Tess felt at ease there on the floor of the Evans' living room.  She
felt content.  Happy.  Luxuriating in the beauty of the sun glowing
blindingly on her face, Tess decided to simply wait for Liz to wake up
before moving.  And while waiting, she could watch Liz sleep.  Tess smiled.</p>

<p>Liz could still feel Tess.  Liz slid her eyes apart slowly, rather glad that
she could still feel the leveling of pain and joy between herself and the
other girl.  They never let go last night, Liz realized, smiling as she
noted that Tess had an incredible expression of peace on her face.</p>

<p>"Good Morning," Liz whispered, the smile in her voice, reaching her free
hand out to carress Tess's sunbrightened chin and cheek.</p>

<p>Tess was glad to hear Liz's voice.  She had been thinking about last night
and everything that had changed, noting within herself the restfulness that
had remained from the night before.  "Morning," she said, but noting that
her voice sounded too loud for this early in the morning, she lowered it.
"I hope I didn't wake you," she added, sitting up as Liz did the same.</p>

<p>Tess unwillingly moved to pull her hand out of Liz's and Liz resisted.  In
explanation, Liz grinned, "It feels good.  I'm afraid we'll lose ...
whatever this connection is if we let go."</p>

<p>Tess nodded in understanding.  She had the same fear.  "I know what you
mean. But I don't think we'll lose it.  A connection like this - it doesn't
just disappear.  I think we would be able to make it happen again."</p>

<p>Liz, ever the scientist thought for a moment.  "You're right, it doesn't
feel impermanent.  Maybe we should test it: you know, let go and then try to
connect again."</p>

<p>Tess thought about it.  And smiled sweetly, "Makes sense.  Lets give it a
try."</p>

<p>They both waited, staring at their hands and willing the other to let go.
Finally, blushing, they looked up at each other.  "We're going to have to
let go.  Count of three.  One - two - three."  And they released hands.</p>

<p>It was strange not having Liz there anymore.  Tess had gotten so used to the
presence in their sleep, that she had hardly recognized the connection upon
waking.  But it's absence was keen, suddenly her own emotions seemed so much
louder in her head.  She felt orphaned in her own mind.  In Liz's eyes, she
saw the same loss.  With remorse, Liz felt the absence of Tess in her mind.
The emotions in Tess had felt so similar to her own, that she had felt a
closeness with the girl that she couldn't begin to explain.  Pausing to
think about the feelings flowing through her, Liz realized how strong her
love for this small girl sitting beside her was.  It was amazing.  Quickly
she reached back out to Tess, and, their fingers once again twining, felt
the connection reform and spread, like warmth, through her body.  It was
full of love.  Liz smiled at the warmth - the love and felt herself warming
with matching emotions.  Tess was amazed by the depths of the emotion she
fell falling off of Liz for her.  For her, Tess marveled.  Liz loved her.</p>

<p>They both smiled and reluctantly let go again.  It was there.</p>

<p>"Well, that's good to know," Tess said, resisting the urge to crow with
relief.</p>

<p>Liz grinned back at Tess's bright face.  "What do you say we see what they
have in the kitchen here?  I am starving."</p>

<p>Laughing, Tess agreed.</p>

<p>Isabel and Maria paused at the entry to the kitchen, surprised by the sight
that greeted them.  The floor between the sink and the island was covered in
flour.  Every inch of the counter space overflowed with clean and dirty
dishes, while the flour canister sat open beside what looked like a hundred
eggs shells and the box of baking soda and the bottle of sunflower oil.  The
piece de resistance though was undoubtedly the griddle, sitting prominently
in the center of the island, covered in globs of pancakes, both burned and
raw.  Isabel followed a trail of flour from the island to kitchen table and
couldn't decide whether to laugh or scream.</p>

<p>There, happily gobbling down pancakes, sat Liz and Tess, covered from head
to toe in white flour, their bare feet having carried the stuff from the
griddle to the table.</p>

<p>Beside Iz, Maria coughed, obviously holding back a laugh.  Maria couldn't
decide which was funnier, Tess and Liz and their obvious flour fight, or the
completely stunned and shellshocked look on Isabel's face.  Finally,
deciding that it didn't matter which was funnier, Maria grabbed onto Isabel
for support and broke into uncontolled howls of laughter, slowly sliding
down Iz to sit on the floor.</p>

<p>Tess and Liz, oblivious to the other girls' presence up to that point turned
from their conversation and grinned unrepentantly at Isabel as Maria
collapsed to the floor with laughter.</p>

<p>Tess turned to Liz, "Is she alright?" she asked.</p>

<p>Liz nodded her head, "I think Isabel will recover from the shock in a moment
and be grateful that we thought to make extra pancakes for them."</p>

<p>Absently grabbing the tabasco bottle the Evans kept at the table, Tess shook
her head.  "No, not Isabel.  I know she'll survive.  She needs to see things
like this more often.  I meant Maria.  Is it possible to hurt yourself from
laughing like that?"</p>

<p>Calmly cutting another bite of her pancake, Liz met Tess's eyes, "I think I
would like to try yours.  I've always been curious about the Tabasco."  She
opened her mouth as Tess cut a bite and offered it to Liz.  Liz was shocked
when she didn't feel the urge to spit it back out, "Not bad.  Not bad at
all.  Oh, don't worry about Maria.  She'll be fine in no time."  Turning to
look at Maria, Liz called out, "If you don't hurry, Maria, your pancake's
will get cold."</p>

<p>Liz grinned at Tess's admiring gaze as Maria automatically stood and began
getting control of herself.  "Where are they?" she asked almost desperately.</p>

<p>"She is unbelievably hungry in the morning," Liz explained and Tess nodded
her head.</p>

<p>As Maria began to explore the kitchen, opening cupboard drawers, Tess said,
"In the microwave, Maria.  Are you all right Isabel?"</p>

<p>Isabel shook herself.  "You do know my mom is going to have a heart attack
when she sees what you've done to her kitchen don't you?"</p>

<p>Liz looked at Tess conspiratorily, "Don't worry about it, Iz.  We've got it
covered."</p>

<p>With a wink, Tess stood and casually swept the flour off the floor using her
powers and looked at Isabel, "I'll get the rest after breakfast," she
explained as she sat back down,</p>

<p>"It's only fair that Tess clean up the mess.  She started the fight in the
first place."</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head as she looked at the two girls, a smile slowly forming
on her now relaxed face.  "Just don't forget to clean yourselves up as
well."  And with that, Isabel finally gave into the urge and laughed,
turning to Maria who was already busily spread peanut butter on her
pancakes.  "Hey, leave a couple of those for me, Maria!" She shouted and
lunged to protect the two uncovered pancakes left.</p>
