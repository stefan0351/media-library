<p><b>2014 - Jessie's Apartment</b></p>

<p>Grace threw her bag down on Jessie's couch then turned
to face her husband who was grumbling from his position behind her.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure Jessie didn't give us that
key so that we could just invite ourselves over for breakfast whenever we wanted,"
Eli started rooted just inside the doorway. "We should..."</p>

<p>"We're already here, so the damage is done,"
Grace said sighing. "Besides it'd hardly be a surprise breakfast if we called
her and had her buy groceries before hand," she continued shaking her head at him.</p>

<p>"I'm just saying..." Eli started knowing
that Jessie wouldn't find this to be one of those fun surprises.</p>

<p>"Can you put the stuff in the kitchen, I'm going
to go get her up," Grace said already heading down the hallway to the bedroom
ignoring Eli's grumbles.</p>

<p>"Surprise!" Grace called smiling flinging
Jessie's bedroom door open, stopping dead in her tracks the moment she stepped in the
room. Jessie's sheets were strewn all over the floor, while Jessie herself stood off
to the side of the room near the open bathroom door in a towel that just barely covered
the essentials rubbing her hair dry, while a very naked woman laid sprawled out on her
stomach on Jessie's bed, a towel thrown loosely over her waist barely covering her
posterior end from Grace's view. "Oh. My. God," Grace ground out staring at
Jessie wide eyed as her stepsister simply blinked at her.</p>

<p>"Grace," Jessie said slowly, just as surprised to
see her stepsister as Grace was to have walked in on the scene she walked in on.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," Grace muttered backing out
of the room. "I'll just be," she continued jerking her thumb towards the
living room. "I'll just leave you two too...whatever," she went on
before closing the door and heading back down the hall.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Katie asked raising her
head sleepily, blinking at the blurry form that was Jessie. She thought she heard voices,
and really hoped that they weren't in her head.</p>

<p>"Grace is here," Jessie said her attention still
on her now closed bedroom door.</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked flipping over then drawing
her legs up to cover her chest when she realized she was naked, and then yanking the towel
in front of her to try and cover anything else that might have been visible.</p>

<p>"Oh don't bother with that," Jessie said
smirking. "She's gone. And she saw you in all your glory," she continued
flinging her wet hair towel at Katie.</p>

<p>"What...gone where...my glory..." Katie
said plucking the towel off of her head and looking over at Jessie.</p>

<p>"You should probably put some clothes on," Jessie
said ripping off the towel she had around her body as she stepped into closet.
"She's waiting for us in the living room."</p>

<p>"...with a naked woman ON the bed. Naked,"
Grace said emphatically gesturing to Eli.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Eli responded, happy that Jessie finally
seemed to be getting some. He was secure enough with himself to admit that his sister was
rather foxy, and her complete lack of a love life over the years was really a disservice
to humankind as far as he was concerned. "That's kind of what she does," he
continued earning a hearty slap from a flustered Grace.</p>

<p>Eli laughed for a moment grabbing her hands and stopping
her from beating him before sensing another presence in the room and turning around.
Looking up, he saw his sister dressed in pair of faded jeans and a form fitting white
t-shirt, and a woman with impossibly long legs in shorts and a tank top. A woman who kind
of looked like...</p>

<p>"Katie?" Grace asked stepping forward to get a
better look at the woman beside Jessie. Katie Singer? Grace thought to herself. Had they
entered the Twilight zone? Oh hell, that meant she'd just seen Katie Singer naked. On
Jessie's bed. When did they get back together? Geez, she had a nice tan. Jessie was
so going to get the third degree hell for telling her that Katie was back in town? Were
those the shorts she'd left there?</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie said shifting uncomfortably under
Grace's gaze, wondering what the hell the woman could have been thinking to get an
expression like that on her face. "Congratulations," she continued waving at
Grace's stomach. Not the most tactful approach, but she wasn't too concerned
with tact at that particular moment, she just wanted to not fell completely and utterly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Yeah, to you too," Grace muttered her eyes
flickering between Katie and Jessie, then back towards the bedroom before she realized
what had come out of her mouth turned beet red, stepping back once more. It had been fun
to tease Jessie about her love life, but not so much so now that she had actually walked
in on it.</p>

<p>"Hey," Eli greeted feeling the need to say
something, but not sure what would be appropriate under the circumstances. What did one
say to woman who had left said sister an emotional wreck and socially retarded her for
years as a result of their abrupt break-up, only to emerge ten years later from that same
sisters bedroom after having apparently been naked on her bed?</p>

<p>"Hey," Katie replied nodding and smiling at him
before her eyes drifted over to Jessie helplessly. This was not how she had planned on
spending her morning. Jessie, bed and possibly whipped cream was how she had planned on
spending her morning. Was Grace looking at her?</p>

<p>Jessie eyes shifted away from Katie, not quite knowing what
to say either, her gaze finally migrating over to the kitchen counter where she could make
a pile of have unpacked groceries.</p>

<p>"You know, this really isn't what the key was
for," she commented scowling over at her brother. Nothing returned her to a state of
equilibrium like picking on her brother.</p>

<p>"I told you," Eli said triumphantly rounding to
face Grace who glared him back into silence within seconds.</p>

<p>"Did you really see me naked?" Katie blurted out
unable to stand the brief glances Grace was shooting at her.</p>

<p>Grace blinked then opened her mouth only to shut it and
blink some more as she flashed back to the bedroom. Really, Katie had beautiful skin.</p>

<p>"Right," Eli said breaking the uncomfortable
silence that had formed. "So, ah ... we were going to make pancakes."</p>
