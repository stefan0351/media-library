<p>Buffy smiled slightly as she remembered that first
&#145;family&#146; dinner with the Rosenberg's.</p>

<p>Willow was nervous but Buffy was terrified. This
was the first time she was doing something that was this important to her Wills and she
was determined to make it perfect.</p>

<p>Her first problem was finding the right something
to wear, she'd gone through her closet trying on everything she owned, none of them were
quite right. The piles of clothes scattered all over her room testified to the frantic
search.</p>

<p>Finally she and Willow gave up and went shopping
and since the mall was her home ground they took Cordelia to help. After several hours and
several stores and specialty shops the three of them came up with just the right outfit,
even Cordy thought Buffy looked good.</p>

<p>Buffy's mother, understanding how important it was
for the girls, sprung for a rare trip to the salon for both of them. When the time came
two very nervous and very frightened but very beautiful young women stood at the door of
the Rosenberg home.</p>

<p>They all sat down to dinner in the formal dinning
room, and began eating in nervous silence, small snippets of polite conversation were all
that broke up the steadily mounting tension. Everyone was afraid of saying the wrong
thing. Finally Buffy looked over at Willow who gave her a pleading look and remembering
something Willow had told her long ago she decided to try something different.</p>

<p>She left Mrs. Rosenberg to Willow, and
concentrated on winning over Mr. Rosenberg.</p>

<p>&#147;So, Mr. Rosenberg,&#148; Buffy began
crossing her fingers under the table, &#147;Willow tells me you fish. I think some of my
best times were going to the pier with my dad when I was a kid.&#148;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>It was the truth and it worked, she could see the
man brighten up, knowing that she was on the right track and before the night was over,
Buffy and Mr.R (as he insisted she call him, all his friends did.) were down in his work
shop where he was teaching Buffy to tie flies.</p>

<p>Willow was so happy her face hurt from smiling.
After that night Willow's parents warmed up to Buffy and soon she was taking off at least
twice a month to go fishing with Mr. R and his other fishing buddies. Even Willow's mother
would call Buffy by her name every once in a while instead of &#145;that girl&#146; or
&#145;the other one&#146;, Buffy's personal favorite.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the semester the rumor mill got
bored with talking the openly affectionate couple, and with a few exceptions either
accepted or ignored them. Which was just fine with them. Unfortunately those few
exceptions felt it necessary to make their presence known and for the second their room
was broken into and trashed but this time they didn't just destroy everything they painted
extremely offensive and hateful sayings and names on the walls.</p>

<p>Once again the university promised a through
investigation and they would of course replace all their damaged personal property. This
time however Willow's parents were involved and after discussing it with Buffy's mother
insisted the couple move into a condo in Giles complex, in fact they got them the place
right next door to him.</p>

<p>It made both sets of parents feel better knowing
he was there to &#145;watch&#146; over their daughters. Buffy always laughed at their
choice of words and how they seemed to make Giles uncomfortable every time he heard them.</p>

<p>They'd moved right in, using the insurance to
furnish their new place. Everything met with their parent's approval with the possible
exception of the huge king size bed for their room, they all seemed a little nervous any
time anything about beds and sleeping arrangements come up so they avoided the subject
when ever possible, which again was just fine with the girls.</p>

<p>Willow's training was coming along nicely, while
she wasn't as strong or as fast as the Slayer, but she was combining the fighting
techniques she learned from Giles and Buffy with her other powers.</p>

<p>She was fast becoming a formidable partner for
Buffy in her constant battle against the Darkness, and to be honest Buffy found it was
nice to have someone there always watching her back.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>On their first official night out on patrol
as equals they ran into the demon that had hurt Buffy so badly. Before Buffy could even
challenge it, Willow stepped in front of her and pointed her staff at the hulking red
demon.</p>

<p>&#147;You will harm my love no more.&#148; Willow
said calmly. A bright neon green light shot from the emerald embedded in the head of the
staff, it flashed across the space between her and the demon and wrapped around him
several times binding him.</p>

<p>He roared in agony as she took another step
forward.</p>

<p>&#147;Go back to the hell that spawned you and
plague us no more&#148; she pronounced like a judge handing down a death sentence. She
stabbed the ground with the iron-shod foot of the staff and a swirling black vortex opened
in the ground beneath the immobile demon and he was sucked into it screaming in fear and
pain then it closed over him leaving the ground undisturbed as if he had never existed.</p>

<p>Buffy was still starring slack jawed when Willow
turned and looked at her with a shy embarrassed grin. &#147;Whoa babe,&#148; Buffy was
finally able to say &#147;remind me to never piss you off.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;He hurt you&#148; was all Willow said.</p>

<p>Buffy laughed and hugged the most precious thing
in her life, for the first time Buffy felt 'safe' on patrol because now her Wills would
always be there to protect her.</p>
