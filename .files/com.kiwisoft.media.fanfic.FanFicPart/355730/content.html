<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Nineteen -->

<p>Saturday morning came and went, with both women maintaining a not so subtle distance between them. Conversation was minimal, at best. Reduced to short questions, and even shorter answers. Both women showed signs of the prior sleepless night. As evidenced by their haggard expressions and the listlessness of their movements.</p>
		<p>But neither was willing to talk about it.</p>
		<p>It still hurt too much.</p>
		<p>"Are you ready?" Randi was standing by the open passenger door, watching the blonde bid a tender farewell to the two canines that, by their subdued behavior, weren't happy this morning either.</p>
		<p>"You have no idea how ready," the blonde sniped as she climbed into her seat and yanked the door closed.</p>
		<p>Randi sighed as she walked around the jeep and got in.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Megan was pleasantly surprised as she walked into Toby's Gas and Grocery. It seemed the big man had made some changes in the past couple of months. Shelves and racks had been rearranged and moved back, to create a large open space in the front half of the store. A space that was now occupied by three small, cozy round tables with chairs. Each table wore a tablecloth decorated with a homey, checkerboard design. A small vase filled with an assortment of wildflowers completed each table.</p>
		<p>
			<i>I like it, </i> the young woman mused as a small smile, her first of the day, creased her face.
		</p>
		<p>"From the smile on your face, I'd say it meets with your approval, Ms. Megan."</p>
		<p>Megan turned to face the owner of the deep, rumbling voice, a deeper smile etching her face. "Very much so." She held out her hand in greeting and it was immediately enclosed by two big, warm, callused ones and held for a long moment as kindly gray eyes examined her. "It's good to see you again, little one. I was sorry about your accident, but I'm glad that Randi found you and took care of you. Are you all right now?"</p>
		<p>"I'm fine," the blonde reassured. "Dr. Oakes did take good care of me and, now that the roads are clear, I'm headed home."</p>
		<p>"Yes, Randi told me that you had a car coming for you." The older man was slightly surprised at Megan's use of Randi's title, instead of her given name. It was his understanding, from conversations with the raven-haired doctor, that they were getting along well. Now, he wasn't so sure. And, noticing the weary, pained look the young woman was trying to hide, he decided not to ask questions. "Why don't you have a seat and let me get you something to eat while you're waiting?"</p>
		<p>The mere thought of food made the writer's stomach turn. "I'm, uh, I'm really not hungry right now, Toby. Something to drink would be nice though," she offered as she sat down.</p>
		<p>"That's fine, Ms. Megan, I'll?"</p>
		<p>Both heads turned at the tinkling of the doorbell announcing Randi's entrance.</p>
		<p>The older man was hard pressed to stifle a gasp at the pale, haggard appearance of the woman he had come to think of as a daughter.
			<i>Dear lord, she hasn't looked like that since?What the devil's going on here? </i> Wisely choosing to save his questions for later, Toby broke into a big smile and boomed, "there's my girl. Please excuse me for a moment, Ms. Megan. Terry," he called to a petite, tow-headed girl who was sitting at another table, talking with a red headed woman. "Please get Ms. Megan a hot chocolate." With that, he walked away.
		</p>
		<p>Megan watched the beautiful brunette walk in the door and pause, her crystal blue gaze seeking, and immediately locating, her old friend and former patient. In spite of the brunette's haggard appearance, the writer's reaction was as immediate as it was unstoppable.
			<i> God, she's beautiful. </i>Megan's face screwed up in disgust at the unbidden thought, and she cursed her rebellious heart for its suddenly rapid beat.
			<i>Stop it! You don't want her. You don't need her. You don't even
				<b> like</b> her. She's just like all the rest. Remember that!
			</i>She scolded, tearing her eyes from the tall beauty, and finding the tablecloth pattern extremely interesting.
		</p>
		<p>So intense was Megan's perusal of the tabletop, that she never noticed Toby's departure, nor the arrival of her chocolate until it was placed in front of her. Startled, she looked up into friendly brown eyes. "Sorry about that," the writer offered. "Woolgathering."</p>
		<p>"No problem," the girl smiled, offering her hand. "I'm Terry."</p>
		<p>"Nice to meet you," the writer smiled back, taking the proffered hand. "I'm Megan."</p>
		<p>"I know. You write the Samantha Steele mysteries." The girl beamed, then paused before adding shyly," um, could you, um, if you don't mind, would you sign my book?</p>
		<p>"I'd be delighted," the writer smiled.</p>
		<p>"Great! I'll be right back." With that, she sprinted toward the back of the store. Megan heaved an amused sigh and sipped her chocolate.
			<i>Mmmm, delicious. This can't be instant. I'll have to see if I can get Toby to tell me how he makes it. </i> Megan's eyes automatically shifted to the front of the store where the big man stood in earnest conversation with the younger woman. She couldn't hear what was being said but from their body language, he with one big hand clasping her arm and the other gently cupping her face, and she leaning into the caress while nodding agreeably, Megan could pretty much guess what was being said.
			<i>He's comforting her. She looks like I feel and he's trying to comfort her. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan couldn't suppress the surge of envy that washed through her as she watched the tender interaction between the two.
			<i> Is that what it's supposed to be like with a father and daughter? </i>
		</p>
		<p>"Must be nice," she mumbled with some bitterness as she took another sip of her chocolate and resumed her study of the tablecloth.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Randi stepped gingerly into the cheerful warmth of the little store. She had put it off as long as she could, filling the jeep with gas, checking the fluids, washing the windows, and any other little thing she could do that would keep her away from the two people that could very easily bring her to tears right now. Toby, with his loving concern, and Megan with her biting words. Not that she could blame the young woman. Megan needed something from Randi last night. Something that the raven-haired woman was unwilling to give. The reasons seemed clear enough last night. But now, in the cold, clear light of day, the doctor had to wonder if they were reasons?or excuses. A way to keep the blonde at arms distance, prevent her from knowing
			<b>all</b> of Randi. And, upon that knowing, finding her wanting?and then she would leave?just like everyone else Randi loved.
			<i> Not that it matters. She's leaving today, anyway. So, maybe everything worked out exactly like it should. </i> Randi stood for a moment, taking in the changes to the interior.
			<i> Nice</i>, she thought briefly before setting sight on the big man and the small blonde. She winced internally as she noted the shock that flashed across the big man's face before he concealed it with a big smile and a loud proclamation of "There's my girl."
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>I must look like shit, </i> she mused as her eyes flicked briefly to the seated blonde, whose expression was one of schooled indifference.
			<i>She doesn't look much better. Even so, she's still beautiful. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Any further musing was cut short, as she was engulfed in the warm and loving embrace of her 'uncle.'</p>
		<p>An embrace that, contrary to her intentions, she melted into with a desperate abandon that she hadn't felt since she was a young girl.</p>
		<p>Finally, the long, massive arms released their willing captive just enough for the big man to study the younger woman. Callused hands kept a gentle but firm grip on her shoulders as he studied her face.</p>
		<p>"You're not looking good, Princess," the big man rumbled softly. "You sounded better than this on the phone the other day. What happened, honey?"</p>
		<p>Randi dropped her head, and watery blue eyes squeezed shut in an effort to bind the tears that threatened to fall. "I can't go into it right now, Uncle Toby," she whispered hoarsely. "Let's just say that I failed somebody again."</p>
		<p>A large hand cupped her chin and lifted her head until liquid blue eyes were confronted with stormy gray ones.</p>
		<p>"Now you listen to me, Randi Christine Oakes," the old man growled. "You didn't fail anybody the
			<b>first</b> time. You can't take responsibility for someone else's actions. You can't blame yourself for not being there if you don't get the call. And you most certainly can't prevent the inevitable. You're a doctor, Randi, and you know it's the truth." The stormy gray eyes gentled as the storekeeper placed a soft kiss on an ebony eyebrow. "And someday soon, your heart's going to accept it too. I have faith in that?in you." The large hand moved from her chin, to cup her cheek. "We'll talk more about this new problem later," he promised, getting a small nod in agreement. "But right now you need a good cup of old Toby's coffee. Now go find you seat. I'll be right back."
		</p>
		<p>Randi looked toward the table area, or, more specifically, at one table in particular, and hesitated.
			<i>Maybe I should stay outside for a while longer. </i> Then, remembering something that she carried in her back pocket, decided.
			<i>What the hell. Not much she can say that hasn't already been said. </i> With a resigned sigh, the tall woman approached the blonde's table.
		</p>
		<p>Cool green eyes lifted and studied her briefly. "What?"</p>
		<p>Randi reached into her back pocket for the diskettes and placed them on the table. "You left these on the nightstand. If you've got any of your writing on them, you'll want to keep them?to make sure you have a backup."</p>
		<p>Megan had left them there intentionally. She wanted to take as little as possible away from this encounter, but the tall woman made a good point. "Thank you," she replied coolly. I'll be sure to add these to the reimbursement check. Along with the clothes I'm wearing."'</p>
		<p>Randi shook her head. "That isn't necessary. I've got tons of empty discs that I don't need. And, as for the clothes, hell, I haven't worn them since I was a teenager. They're just old jeans and sweats that I left here when I went away to college. I figured Jake would toss them out, but, being the packrat he is, he put them up in the attic instead."</p>
		<p>"Be that as it may," the blonde replied crisply. "I still intend to pay for them. I don't want to owe you for anything, Dr. Oakes. Not a blessed thing."</p>
		<p>Randi ran her fingers through her hair and blew out a frustrated breath. "You don't owe me anything! At first, I took care of you because it was the right thing to do. And later on, it was because I
			<b>wanted</b> to?because I
			<b>cared</b>. Just like I cared last night. I couldn't let you do something you'd be sorry for later on. If I was wrong?I'm sorry. If I offended you?I'm sorry."
		</p>
		<p>Somewhere down deep, the writer knew the truth of Randi's words. The tall woman only ever acted in her patient's best interest. But that truth was buried deep beneath the anger and pain of being rejected yet again by someone she?
			<i>loved</i>? "Tell me, doctor; do you often make decisions for others, and have to apologize for it later? Is that what you did to your beloved Casey? Is that why she left you?"
		</p>
		<p>Randi rocked back as if it were a physical blow. Her face became a pale, expressionless mask. But the eyes that stared into Megan's revealed a depth of pain that took the younger woman's breath away.</p>
		<p>Without a word, the tall woman turned and walked away.</p>
		<p>Megan watched the retreating figure in stunned silence, completely unaware of her equally stunned audience. Until the thump of a coffee mug being set on the table got her attention. She looked up into gray eyes that reflected both anger and deep disappointment.</p>
		<p>"That was wrong, Ms. Megan. That was just plain wrong," the old man rumbled before striding briskly out the door in search of the distraught doctor.</p>
		<p>"And this day just keeps getting better," the blonde mumbled into her cup, trying desperately to ignore the guilt that was creeping up her spine.</p>
		<p>She couldn't ignore, however, the slim, silent woman that seemed to simply appear, and who now stood eyeing her critically.</p>
		<p>"You're Megan Galagher, the writer." It was more a statement than a question.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I am," the blonde responded warily. The woman didn't appear threatening, but she didn't seem all that friendly either.</p>
		<p>"You tell good stories, Ms. Galagher. If you don't mind, I'd like a few moments of your time. I'd like to tell you a story."</p>
		<p>
			<i>You've
				<b>got</b> to be kidding me! I don't need this.
			</i> "I'm not sure," she made a point of checking her watch. "Someone's supposed to be picking me up any time now."
		</p>
		<p>A small, knowing smile curved pink lips. "It won't take long, Ms. Galagher. I really think you need to hear this story."</p>
		<p>"Fine," the blonde acquiesced. "Please, have a seat."</p>
		<p>"Thank you," the willowy redhead smiled as she sat down. Clasping her hands in front of her, the redhead took a deep breath and began.</p>
		<p>"Once upon a time," she began, quirking a wry grin at the fairy tale beginning she was using. "There was this beautiful little princess who became very ill one night. So ill in fact, that she had to be brought to the emergency room of a hospital. And the little princess was very scared. She couldn't understand why she was having such trouble breathing, and to make matters worse, all these big people were wearing masks and doing all kinds of uncomfortable things to her without telling her why. So the princess began to cry and squirm, trying to make these masked people leave her alone, but they wouldn't. And then, someone else walked into her room. Someone very tall, with long, dark hair and very blue eyes. This tall person spoke very briefly with the other people in the room, and then walked over to the princess' bed. Then she did something that none of the other big people did; she took the princess' hand in hers, and then she pulled the mask down from her face. She smiled at the princess and said, 'hi, I'm Randi, and I'd like to try and make you feel better. Will you help me do that?' The princess liked the doctor's pretty smile and the fact that the doctor was actually talking
			<b>to</b> her, so she let doctor Randi and the other big people help her. Unfortunately, it was discovered that she had AIDS. It was a 'gift' from her daddy that mommy never knew about. Because of that, the princess had occasion to visit the hospital more often than she would have liked. And she became very good friends with the pretty doctor." Here, the redhead paused thoughtfully as a bittersweet smile creased her lips. "No, they became so much more than friends. The princess worshipped the ground that doctor Randi walked on. And everyone knew that the doctor felt the same way. For she doted on the princess as no one else ever had, except for her mommy."
		</p>
		<p>The redhead paused in her tale long enough to take a sip of her coffee and gather the courage she would need to finish the story. Megan was, by now thoroughly engrossed in the other woman's story, even though she had a sinking feeling she knew how it would end.
			<i> But what the hell does this have to do with me, and why did she think I needed to hear it? </i> Nevertheless, the writer listened intently as the redhead began again.
		</p>
		<p>"Two years passed. Two years in which the princess and her mommy had many fun times with the good doctor. Unfortunately, the fun would not last. For the princess came down with a cold that, very quickly turned into pneumonia. Once again, she was brought to the hospital, and once again the good doctor was there for her. The princess would spend many days in the hospital, struggling very valiantly to fight her sickness, and doctor Randi would spend every possible moment watching over her. But doctor Randi was also working double shifts in the emergency room because of a staff shortage. By the end of the week, doctor Randi was near collapse and her supervisor ordered her to leave the hospital for at least twenty-four hours so that she could rest. Randi didn't want to leave the princess, but she had no choice. So she went home. Now, at the time, doctor Randi was seeing a young lady named Jenna. Jenna was very nice, and she cared a great deal for the doctor. But she was also of a mind that the doctor worked entirely too hard. So when doctor Randi was sent home to rest, Jenna took it upon herself to make sure that the doctor did just that. For when the doctor fell asleep, Jenna unplugged the phone and turned off her pager and cell phone. As fate would have it, the princess' health took a dramatic turn for the worst. The nurses tried many times to contact the doctor, to no avail. No one knows what woke the doctor out of a sound sleep, but awaken she did, and she automatically checked her pager, only to find it had been turned off. When she turned it on and saw the messages, she set out for the hospital immediately, knowing without question that her princess needed her. Alas, by the time she got there, it was too late. The princess was in full cardiac arrest, and nothing doctor Randi did, not medicine, not electric shock, nor pleading, would bring her back. And when she died, Doctor Randi Oakes died too. She left her job, her career, her friends, Jenna. She left them all. She came back here and exiled herself to that damn house on the hill, refusing all contact from those that loved her and would offer comfort she felt she didn't deserve. For she loved the princess so; and blamed herself for the princess' death; believing with all her poor heart that if she had gotten there sooner, she could have saved her. But she's wrong. Nothing she could have done would have saved the princess. The little one was simply too tired to keep fighting, and so the Angels took her home.
			<b>We</b> all know that; and someday, with our help, Randi will know it too." Piercing amber eyes caught and held solemn green ones. "Little
			<b>Casey</b> Tucker would want it that way."
		</p>
		<p>Green eyes widened in comprehension and a guilty flush stole over pale cheeks as the writer lowered her head. "I didn't know," she whispered.</p>
		<p>"No, you didn't," the redhead agreed. "You didn't know the first thing about it, but you slapped her across the face with it anyway. That's a pretty lousy thing to do to a woman who saved your life, took you into her home, and cared for you for two months."</p>
		<p>Megan bristled at the condemnation in the woman's tone, as defensiveness overcame guilt. "Look, you don't know me, and you don't know what happened. I had my reasons." She hissed.</p>
		<p>The redhead cocked an eyebrow. "Did you, now?" Rising out of her chair, the redhead leaned over, placing both palms flat on the table and stared directly into defiant green eyes. "You're right, I don't know you. But I do know Randi. She is the sweetest, kindest, gentlest and most caring individual I've ever known, and I can't think of a single thing she could have done to deserve what I've seen today."</p>
		<p>The woman straightened to full height and shook her head. "You may be a fine writer, Ms. Galagher, but you're not a nice person." With that, she walked away.</p>
		<p>Too flustered to offer any retort, the writer simply sat and stared as the redhead walked out the door. Finally, regaining some composure, she picked up her lukewarm drink. "Who in the hell does she think she is, anyway," she grumbled.</p>
		<p>"That was Amy Tucker?Casey's' mother," the tow-headed waitress responded, placing a paperback book on the table. "You can keep this. I don't think I want it anymore," she added before she too walked away, leaving the writer with only her misery for company.</p>
		<p>Before long, a cream-colored luxury sedan pulled up in front of the store. Catching sight of it, the blonde bolted up from the table and was out the door before the vehicle had a chance to park. Whipping open the back door, Megan let out a happy cry as she clambered into the car and into the surprised arms of her publisher friend.</p>
		<p>"Well, I've certainly missed you too," the publisher drawled with amusement to the trembling body clinging to her.
			<i> "Trembling? </i>" The publisher gently disengaged the clinging blonde and leaned back a little, trying to do a visual inspection. "Honey, are you?is everything okay?"
		</p>
		<p>"Everything's fine, Charly. Can we just go?"</p>
		<p>"Well?of course we can," the older woman offered hesitantly. "I was hoping to meet the delightful doctor Oakes, though. I wanted to offer my personal thanks for her taking such good care of you. Is she not here?" the older woman inquired, looking around.</p>
		<p>"No," the blonde responded, a little too quickly for the publisher's liking. "Dr. Oakes something to do. She had to leave. You can thank her with a check when we get back home," she finished coolly.</p>
		<p>"
			<i>Ouch</i>" "All right, my young friend," gentle fingers grasped the younger woman's chin. "What's going on here?" she inquired sternly.
		</p>
		<p>Liquid green eyes searched warm brown ones, pleading. "Not here, Charly?not now. Please. I just want to go home."</p>
		<p>The publisher heaved a frustrated sigh. "Fine. But we're going to have a long talk when we get home, Megan." With that, she addressed the driver. "Let's go, Jim."</p>
		<p>The car began moving and the blonde sank wearily into the plush leather seat. Turning her head to the window as they moved away, she took a last look at the quaint little store she would likely never see again.</p>
		<p>And emitted a quiet gasp at the sight of the big man who stood next to the building.</p>
		<p>Holding on tightly to the familiar, tall body that convulsed with sobs she could not hear.</p>
		<p>It was a sight that would haunt her for a very long time.</p>
