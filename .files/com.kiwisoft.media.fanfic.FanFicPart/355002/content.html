<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 46: Another Rescue -->

<p>A flash of lightning lit up the window followed almost
		immediately by a clap of thunder that rattled the pane and shot Josie into instant
		wakefulness. Rebecca still lay with her head on the gunslinger?s chest, but she had
		slid down and was now curled up against her side. Josie had pulled the blanket off the cot
		they had not needed during the night and spread it over them to keep off the chill. She
		was glad she had because the temperature had dropped considerably during the night, and
		Rebecca was shivering slightly even with the blanket.</p>

		<p>A hard rain began to pound the building with a force that shook
		the window yet again. Josie was not certain she heard the knock on the outer door until
		she heard John?s voice call out, "Miss Josie, Miss Rebecca. I?m going to go
		fetch you some breakfast. I should be back in fifteen minutes or so."</p>

		<p>Josie smiled to think how kind this man had been to her and
		Rebecca. He could easily have locked them in separate cells for their last night, and
		undoubtedly would be in trouble if it were to get out that he had not. "Thanks,
		John," she called back in acknowledgement. She wrapped her arms around the sleeping
		blonde and hugged her tightly. It was inconceivable that this could be the last time she
		would hold Rebecca, feel her precious body against her own. She kissed Rebecca?s
		forehead and whispered into her hair, "Sprite?wake up. We have to get
		dressed."</p>

		<p>"In a minute," Rebecca mumbled, nuzzling her face into
		Josie?s soft breast. Josie settled back and pulled Rebecca close; a minute was about
		all they had, and it was little enough to give to the woman she loved. Without warning,
		she felt wetness sliding down the side of her breast, and realized Rebecca was crying.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Rebecca, please don?t cry. It kills me to see you
		so unhappy." Poor choice of words; the little blonde began to cry aloud. "Shhh,
		baby. Where is that strength you promised me? We aren?t giving up, remember?"</p>

		<p>"I can?t do it, Josie," she sobbed.
		"I?ll kill them before I let them take you!"</p>

		<p>"Don?t even joke about that. You?d be in the same
		boat I am."</p>

		<p>"That?s where I want to be."</p>

		<p>"No you don?t. Listen to me." She put her hand
		under Rebecca?s chin and lifted her head. The soft green eyes were red and swollen,
		her cheeks splotchy and red. "If you did something like that, you would be arrested
		and tried here. It would not prevent them from sending me back; it would just end your
		life early. If I felt I was responsible for that I would spend eternity in hell."</p>

		<p>Rebecca edged her way to the side of the cot and sat up. She took
		a few deep breaths and then turned back to face Josie. "I know that. It?s the
		only reason I would not kill them. But I don?t know how I can bear this?"</p>

		<p>"It?s not over till it?s over." She put on a
		brave face and shifted to sit beside Rebecca on the edge of the cot. "We have to get
		dressed. John will be back soon."</p>

		<p>"Yes," Rebecca replied dully. She began to stand up to
		gather the clothes that had been scattered the night before, but at the last moment she
		turned and threw herself into Josie?s arms. "I love you so much, Josie. I pray
		we still have our whole lives ahead of us, but if this is all we are allowed to have, you
		should know that being with you has been the best thing that ever happened to me."</p>

		<p>Josie swallowed hard to try to keep the tears from forming in her
		eyes as she softly replied, "You must be reading my mind. I was just?"
		Knocking on the outer door interrupted her thought and she called out, "Just a few
		minutes, please John." Kissing Rebecca lightly on the forehead, she rose and began to
		pull her clothes on. Rebecca did the same, the two of them managing to dress within a few
		feet of each other without getting in the way, their motions practiced many a night when
		they could not bear to be so far away from each other that they could not touch.</p>

		<p>"All right, we?re decent," Josie said loudly
		enough for John to hear. Despite that, he took his time opening the door and coming down
		the hall, allowing the women a few more moments alone.</p>

		<p>None of them did more than pick at the breakfast John had laid
		out on the desk in the outer office. When the rain finally began to slow down, the sound
		of utensils scraping plates was the only one to be heard...until the far off wail of a
		train whistle pierced the silence.</p>

		<p>"It?s time," John said softly. He reached to his
		belt to pull off the handcuffs that hung there, and Josie held her hands out in front of
		her without a word. She rose from her chair and walked to where her hat hung on a rack by
		the door.</p>

		<p>"May I have my hat."</p>

		<p>"I?ll get it," Rebecca said, shouldering her way
		past John who was already reaching for the hat. She removed the black Stetson from the
		rack and placed it lovingly on Josie?s head after brushing back the dark tresses as
		Josie always did.</p>

		<p>"Thank you," Josie said, putting every bit of love she
		felt into those two words. Rebecca smiled at her, but didn?t trust herself to speak
		without crying.</p>

		<p>John shuffled for a moment as if uncertain what to do, and then
		he cleared his throat. "I took the liberty of getting your bags from the boarding
		house," he said, thinking to himself, the boarding house they never had the chance to
		use. He picked up the bags from where they lay behind his desk, and handing the lightest
		one to Rebecca he shouldered the heavier one himself. "If you?ll open the door
		and go first, Miss Rebecca, then you Miss Josie?"</p>

		<p>As the little procession made it?s way toward the train
		station, the townspeople came out to watch. The rain had stopped completely shortly before
		they began their walk, but the bruised looking clouds in the distance told of more rain to
		come. As they walked they gathered people as a snowball down a mountain picks up snow.
		Genie fell in beside Rebecca and Jane took up a place on the other side of Josie. The rest
		of their friends flanked John who walked behind Josie.</p>

		<p>A small knot of people waited on the platform for the train to
		arrive, among them the Judge and his clerk, as well as Caleb Cameron. Caleb wore a gun,
		which looked as out of place on his hip as a sunbonnet would have looked on his head. He
		nervously fingered the grip as he watched the approaching crowd. He had not bargained on
		being the one to haul the outlaw back, and he was not certain he would be able to handle
		things if she decided she did not want to go. For now she seemed to have accepted her
		fate; he hoped she would not change her mind. The Judge wore a smile, which did nothing to
		cover up the hate that radiated from his eyes and danced around his body like ball
		lightning. It made Josie shudder to see such unbridled evil aimed at her and her step
		faltered as she realized that she might once have been accused of putting out such a
		vicious aura. Suddenly she realized that the Judge was simply a man who had lost something
		precious in his life, allowing the pain of his loss to turn him into a bitter and lonely
		person. Unfortunately the power of his position allowed him to use that bitterness to
		exact his revenge. Josie straightened her shoulders and with her head high she climbed the
		steps onto the platform, most of her entourage remaining on the ground, only Rebecca and
		Genie remaining by her side.</p>

		<p>It started to rain again, and in an effort to keep them dry, John
		suggested they take a seat on the train even though departure was still twenty minutes
		away. He needed to handcuff Josie to a seat anyway so that he could go get tickets for the
		two women to Kansas City. There was no way he was going to leave her in Caleb?s
		charge for any longer than he absolutely had to. He asked the conductor to show them to
		the car with the least number of people in it, and the man pointed to a car at the middle
		of the platform.</p>

		<p>John placed Josie?s bag in a rack at one end of the car, and
		when Rebecca started to put her bag beside it, he stopped her with his hand. "Keep it
		with you. You might need it." She couldn?t imagine what use her spare clothes
		and a few books would be on the train, but she did not think it worth arguing with him.
		She nodded and picked the bag up again. John addressed the few people who were sitting at
		one end of the car and asked them to move to the other end. He had to show his badge to
		one surly older matron, and finally with a loud ?hrumph? to show her annoyance,
		she rose from her seat and flounced to the other end of the car.</p>

		<p>"Sit here please, Miss Josie," he asked, indicating a
		seat by the window facing forward in the car. When she did, he unlocked the handcuffs and
		passed one bracelet between the armrests on the seat, pulling it up and re-fastening it
		around her wrist. There was very little room for her to move her arms, and she had to turn
		her torso sideways to get comfortable. John?s expression told her how sorry he was
		that he had to leave her like that, and she smiled at him.</p>

		<p>"I don?t blame you for any of this, John. Please
		don?t look so guilty; this was my own doing."</p>

		<p>"I know that, Miss Josie. I just hate to hand you over to
		those two, even for a little while." The two in question had stepped into the car,
		and the Judge overheard the comment and chuckled to himself. Not only did he have the
		murdering Indian where he wanted her, but also he had outwitted the Sheriff and all of his
		delaying tactics. By that evening Josie would be in a jail in Kansas City, and he hoped to
		use his influence to make sure she got a speedy trial. He wanted to see her dead before he
		himself succumbed to the cancer that was ravaging his body. He actually looked forward to
		seeing his wife and children in the hereafter, but if he was going, he wanted to take one
		more redskin with him. Josie Hunter was probably his last chance.</p>

		<p>"Give that handcuff key to Caleb," the Judge ordered.
		With a sigh, John did just that, moving out of the way so that Rebecca could take a seat
		beside Josie. As she was sitting, Rebecca dropped her bag on the floor beside her seat,
		and the catch popped open. When she reached down to close it, her eye was caught by the
		polished gleam of the barrel of one of Josie?s Colt Peacemakers. Quickly glancing up
		to make sure neither Caleb nor the Judge had seen it, she fastened the catch on the bag
		and lifted it up to hold in her lap. She knew the gun was not in there when she left the
		bag at the boarding house, intending to come back and sleep there. Clearly John had put
		the gun, which he had confiscated from Josie when she was arrested, in there for a reason.
		It made no sense that John would have given it to her thinking she would use it to try to
		help Josie escape; he was too honest a lawman to contemplate such an act. As Caleb took a
		seat opposite Josie, with the gun John had reluctantly issued to him resting awkwardly in
		his lap, Rebecca began to suspect that the purpose of the gun was not to free Josie, but
		rather to protect herself from the man she could no longer even remember thinking of as
		father. The Judge settled into the seat opposite Rebecca, his eyes flicking over her
		quickly and dismissing her as unimportant. He turned his gaze to Josie and gave a twisted
		smile.</p>

		<p>"Enjoy the ride," he said venomously. "With any
		luck, your next trip you?ll be lying flat out in a pine box."</p>

		<p>Josie said nothing for a few moments, merely contemplated him
		with her face an unreadable mask. The look on his face reminded her of what she had seen
		reflected back at herself from the mirror during the years she allowed her hatred for the
		railroads and her desire for vengeance to poison every part of her life. Until Rebecca
		showed her that it was possible to love and to forgive?herself as well as
		others?she realized that she was just the same as the man who sat across from her. At
		last she said, "I feel sorry for you, Judge. Your wife would hate that you have
		wasted so much of your life nursing a hatred for an entire people because of a few bad
		ones. I hope you can sort it all out with your God before?" The Judges hand
		lashed out to slap her across the face, but Rebecca was faster. She seized his wrist and
		held it tightly in her hand.</p>

		<p>"Don?t you touch her," she hissed through clenched
		teeth. The Judge turned toward this little woman whom he had so easily dismissed and took
		a harder look. She had strength and a fierce determination to keep the outlaw from harm.
		The Judge decided to pick his moments, and it was too early in the day to provoke a
		conflict with either woman. Once the train was out of the half-breed Sheriff?s
		jurisdiction he could do as he liked, with no one to tell him other wise. Without comment,
		he withdrew his hand and placed it in his lap. Rebecca rested her hand on top of the bag
		in her lap, feeling her heart rate decelerate, and hoping her shaking was not visible to
		the man across from her. She would shoot him before she would let him hurt Josie, and she
		wanted her hand close to the bag just in case.</p>

		<p>John came back into the car and saw the silent tableau in the end
		seats. He stopped beside Rebecca and held out two tickets to her. She glanced at them;
		they read one way to Tahleguah?from Tahlequah. She furrowed her brow as she looked at
		them, but John shook his head imperceptibly as if to say, this is right, don?t worry
		about it.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, John. I appreciate everything you?ve done
		for us. We?ll come back through here when all this is over."</p>

		<p>"I?ll look forward to that, Miss Rebecca." He
		cocked his head at the sound of the conductor calling "all abooard," and then
		turned to Josie. "Good luck to you, Miss Josie. The Cherokee will not be forgetting
		you any time soon." Josie just nodded and smiled, unable to trust her voice. The
		train whistle sounded, and John made his way to the door, jumping out just before the
		train began to move. On the platform Genie, Charles, Horace, Jane, and Belle stood
		silently watching as the cars pulled through, looking through the windows until they saw
		Rebecca and Josie. Genie had told Josie as they walked to the station that she would wait
		for her husband and follow as soon as they could. She still believed that he could do
		something to free Josie even if she were already in the states. Josie was once again
		grateful for the two women who were determined to stand by her through this ordeal.</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded to Josie to turn her head toward the window, and
		when she did she was able to see her little group of supporters one last time before the
		train left the station. Dimly she noted that the rain had stopped once again, and was glad
		that she would not have to make this trip in a downpour. Rain depressed her, and she
		wanted to at least try to put on a brave front for Rebecca. She turned back to Rebecca and
		looked into her sparkling green eyes. Oddly enough, Rebecca seemed very calm compared to
		the way she was when they first boarded the train. Perhaps her success in thwarting the
		Judges attempt to strike her had given her confidence a boost. Whatever it was, it lifted
		Josie?s heart to see her lover relaxed, as she had not been since they first woke up
		that morning.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The train had only been gone from the station for a few minutes
		and had not yet reached full speed when it was obvious that it was beginning to slow down
		again. The whistle shrieked several times as if the engineer were trying to warn someone
		away from the tracks, but despite the warning the speed still decreased until finally it
		came to a complete stop. The conductor made his way down the aisle reassuring the
		passengers that it was probably just a minor problem and they would soon be under way. The
		Judge was not mollified by that explanation and insisted that he make his way to the front
		of the train and find out what the problem was. After trying in vain to convince him, the
		man finally gave up and left the car, promising to return within a few minutes.</p>

		<p>Josie?s gaze drifted to the window and she blinked several
		times as her eyes tried to make sense of what she thought she saw. At first it appeared to
		be a river stretching out in front of the train, with morning mist rolling on top of the
		water. But upon looking closer, she saw that it was not water but people, and the mist was
		steam rising off of them as the rain evaporated from their clothes. As far as the eye
		could see, the track was covered with people; women, children, men, all ages and
		sizes?and all Cherokee. They were on the move, flowing around the train to surround
		it on all sides, and yet it did not seem as if any of them had moved off the tracks. The
		Judge had yet to look out the window and thus had no idea what was causing the delay, but
		Rebecca saw the crowd begin to gather three and four deep outside the window and she could
		not keep the smile from her face. Upon seeing that, the Judge swiveled in his seat to look
		past Caleb and his face whitened at the sight of this sea of Indians.</p>

		<p>"Nooooo," he bellowed in rage as he realized the intent
		of those savages. They made no move to board the train, but they formed a solid wall of
		humanity that would be impossible to move through either with the train or on foot, should
		he decide to take his prisoner off the train and strike out by horseback. He turned to his
		clerk who was sitting on the opposite side of the aisle from him and shrieked at him,
		"Go to the front of the train and tell the engineer to plow through those people!
		They?ll have no choice but to move if he starts up the train!" When the clerk
		made no move to get up, the Judge stood up himself and grabbed the smaller man by his
		lapels and pulled him to his feet. "I said go tell him to move this goddamned
		train!" The Judges face was almost purple with anger, but even though he trembled at
		each word that fell from the Judge?s mouth, the clerk shook his head no.</p>

		<p>"I?m not going to do it," the younger man finally
		squeaked out. "If you want him to do that, you have to tell him yourself. I
		quit." The Judge released the man as if the very thought of touching him was
		repugnant. He stumbled away from the Judge and sat with the other passengers at the
		opposite end of the train, but not before giving Rebecca a small thumbs up sign.</p>

		<p>Irate, the Judge turned Caleb, who was the only person he had
		left on his side and said, "Keep that gun on her. If she moves, shoot her. I?m
		going to get this train moving again." Caleb fumbled with the weapon and trained it
		on the outlaw across from him. The Judge made his way up the aisle and disappeared into
		the next car.</p>

		<p>Knowing that a man with Caleb?s limited experience with a
		gun was as likely to shoot by mistake as on purpose, Rebecca wanted to talk him into
		lowering the gun. "Pa, you don?t have to point the gun at her. She isn?t
		doing anything. She can?t hurt you. Please, lower that gun before you hurt
		someone."</p>

		<p>Caleb wanted a drink. He wanted to be doing
		something?anything?besides sitting here in the middle of nowhere surrounded by
		Indians with a vicious murderer. The fact that he was the one with the gun was a very
		small consolation. He needed a drink.</p>

		<p>"I?ll lower the gun if you?ll get me a
		bottle," he finally managed to say around his parched lips. Rebecca turned to Josie
		with a question on her face, and the outlaw gave a small nod. It would buy them some time
		if he were to have a few drinks, not to mention it would slow down his responses and make
		him less likely to pull the trigger. She hoped. At least it would take the gun away for as
		long as it took him to finish a bottle, and that might be enough.</p>

		<p>"Sure. Okay, I will, but please lower the gun now. I?ll
		be right back." Caleb lowered the gun, but kept it on his thigh with the muzzle still
		pointing at Josie?s mid section. His finger was no longer on the trigger however, so
		Josie relaxed somewhat. Rebecca got to her feet and went to where the small group of
		passengers was huddled together, fearing that there could be gunfire at any moment.
		"It?s going to be all right," she told them softly. "Just stay back
		here and you?ll be fine. Do any of you have a bottle of alcohol you can let me have?
		I need to distract the man with the gun." One by one they shook their heads no until
		she looked at the matron who had refused to budge from her seat earlier.</p>

		<p>The woman nodded to indicate she did indeed have a bottle.
		"It?s a fine French wine for my son who just got married," she said
		haughtily. "I would hate to see it wasted on a lout like that." She jerked her
		head in Caleb?s direction with scorn.</p>

		<p>"Please. I?ll pay you for it. I?ll pay twice what
		you paid for it, but I need that bottle now." The woman looked into Rebecca?s
		desperate face, and it reminded her of her own daughter. How could she say no? With a
		grumble Rebecca could not quite hear, the woman reached into a satchel on the seat beside
		her and pulled out a green bottle wrapped in shiny paper.</p>

		<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you so much." Rebecca gave the
		woman a brief hug before returning to her seat and handing the bottle to Caleb.</p>

		<p>Caleb could not unwrap the bottle and keep his hand on the gun,
		so he stuck the weapon in the waistband of his pants. When the paper was removed he saw
		that the bottle cork was flush with the top of the bottle, and he scowled.
		"How?m I supposed to open this damned thing?" he grumbled. The words were
		scarcely out of his mouth before the matron was standing beside Rebecca holding out a
		corkscrew. Wordlessly she took it from her, and handed the tool to Caleb. His hands shook
		quite a bit as he tried to removed the cork, and in the end it was broken to pieces. He
		finally pushed the remaining bits into the bottle figuring he could strain them out with
		his teeth. In fact, he didn?t much care if he drank the whole damned cork?he
		just needed a drink. Tipping the bottle to his lips he took several long swallows until at
		last his hand seemed to steady itself and he began to feel in control of himself. He sat
		back in his seat and smiled at Rebecca, and for a moment she was reminded of the father
		she once had. After only a few moments however, his gaze traveled from Rebecca?s face
		to the front of her dress and he leered. She knew that she would never make the mistake of
		thinking of him as a father again.</p>

		<p>Caleb seemed to retreat into himself a few minutes later, the
		bottle the only reality he knew. Rebecca leaned toward Josie and was about to tell her
		about the gun in her bag when the Judge?s voice once again filled the train car.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"I told you to keep that gun on her!" He bellowed.
		Caleb blinked a few times, tipped up the bottle and took another swallow before pulling
		the gun from his waistband.</p>

		<p>"She ain?t goin? nowhere," he mumbled.
		Nevertheless he pointed the gun at her with one hand while clutching the bottle with the
		other. His finger was loosely on the trigger but it wouldn?t take more than a nudge
		to send a bullet hurtling into Josie. From that distance there was no way he could miss.</p>

		<p>The Judge paced up and down the aisle of the train; his anger
		building with every moment that passed. The engineer had flatly refused to attempt to move
		the train with all those people on the tracks. He had tried to talk them into moving and
		was met with nothing but silence. Turning to the Judge he simply shrugged as if to say
		they were there until something changed. And the something that would undoubtedly change
		would be the afternoon train bearing the Governors car arriving right on schedule in just
		a few hours. If he had a deputy he could trust, the Judge might have tried to shoot his
		way out with the outlaw and take her by stagecoach or horseback. But the drunken sot with
		the bottle to his lips was less than worthless and he knew they would not get a foot away
		from the train before those savages separated him from his prisoner. It had become
		personal for him now. To begin with, she was just another redskin to be taught a lesson,
		but now she was a thorn in his side, and worse; she may just be allowed to wiggle out of
		this if he could not come up with something.</p>

		<p>The Judge stopped his pacing and walked back to stand over Caleb.
		"Looks as if that reward is going to slip through your fingers," he said in a
		sympathetic tone. Caleb dropped the now empty bottle to the floor and turned his bleary
		gaze to the Judge.</p>

		<p>"Huh? Whyizzat? I got her, ain?t I?"</p>

		<p>"You?ve got her, but not for long if these savages have
		anything to do with it." Caleb turned toward the window and scowled at the people
		there. The muzzle of the gun followed his eyes, and Josie?s heart lurched at the
		thought of him opening fire on the unarmed people outside the window. "They?ll
		never let us take her out of here alive," the Judge continued, drawing Caleb?s
		attention back to him and away from the window. Josie visibly relaxed as the gun was once
		again lowered to rest on Caleb?s thigh. The Judge leaned down closer so that his
		words would not be audible to the people at the other end of the car. "Kill her. Her
		dead body is worth nothing to them, but the reward is good, dead or alive. You can say she
		got loose and tried to take the gun from you. You struggled over it, and it went
		off."</p>

		<p>Caleb blinked again as if trying to digest this suggestion. Josie
		and Rebecca had only caught a word or two of what the Judge whispered to Caleb, but it was
		enough to know that the man did not intend to let her live to tell her story to the
		Governor. As Caleb?s mind registered what he had to do, he slowly began to raise the
		gun, stopping when it was pointed squarely at Josie?s heart.</p>

		<p>"Pa, don?t!" Rebecca said loudly to draw his
		attention away from Josie. In that same instant, Josie scooted down in her seat as far as
		she could, kicking up and connecting with the hand that held the gun and sending it flying
		to the far end of the car. Even as that was happening, Rebecca was pulling the gun from
		her bag and before the Judge had even registered what had happened, Rebecca had the gun
		trained on him. "You do anything to hurt her in any way and I?ll kill you,"
		she said evenly. The tone of her voice left no doubt that she meant exactly what she said.</p>

		<p>"Ow," Caleb said, shaking his wrist and rubbing it with
		his hand. It looked as if he had already forgotten that a moment before he had held a gun
		ready to take a woman?s life. Now he simply wondered why his hand hurt.</p>

		<p>"Give me the key to the handcuffs," Rebecca said to
		Caleb. He looked at her blankly for a moment, and she said again, "The key. In your
		watch pocket." She took her eyes off the Judge while she was talking to Caleb, but
		out of the corner of one eye she could see that he was edging down the aisle. As soon as
		Caleb figured out which of his pockets was the watch pocket and handed the key to Rebecca,
		she turned back to the Judge. "Stop where you are and sit down. Now!" The click
		of the hammer pulling back on the gun was like a cannon volley in the quiet car. He
		dropped into an empty seat and glared at her silently while Rebecca unlocked the
		handcuffs. Josie?s wrists were red and chafed in spots and she rubbed them to bring
		back the circulation. Rebecca held the gun out to Josie while keeping the barrel pointed
		at the Judge, but Josie pushed her hand away.</p>

		<p>"I can?t take that," she said seriously. "I
		haven?t broken any laws here, and I?m not starting now. I think possessing a gun
		while in custody would not look very good to the Governor. Besides, you?re doing fine
		without me." She grinned at Rebecca who smiled back broadly. Josie looked to the
		front of the car where the small group of people was finally beginning to relax and said,
		"Will one of you pick up that gun please, and help my friend here keep any eye on
		him?" She jerked her head in the direction of the Judge. Without hesitation, his
		former clerk got up from his seat and fished the weapon out from under the seat where it
		had landed. He walked back up the aisle and sat far enough away so that the Judge could
		not reach him with his foot, and pointed the gun at him.</p>

		<p>"You?ll never work in another court of law, you
		pathetic little worm," the Judge said venomously.</p>

		<p>"That?s certainly true of one of us," the younger
		man replied calmly. The Judge merely sank back into his seat and glared at each of them in
		turn, as if unable to believe that the tables had been so completely turned. He was
		already planning how he would contact a friend who was a General in the army and make sure
		that all these savages paid for what they had done to assist in Josie?s release.</p>

		<p>Josie turned to the window and held up her free hands with the
		handcuffs clutched in her fingers to show the crowd that she was no longer a captive. The
		cheer that rose from the people made tears spring to her eyes, and she quickly turned
		away.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Listen," Rebecca said excitedly. "Did you hear
		that?" It was now late afternoon and she was beginning to wonder if the
		Governor?s train would indeed be arriving.</p>

		<p>"No, what did you?" the far off wail of the train
		whistle cut her off, and she grinned as she took Rebecca?s hand in hers. Now the only
		thing to worry about was whether he was able to connect with that train, but that concern
		would be resolved on way or another very soon.</p>

		<p>Even before the train itself was visible, Josie could see the
		Cherokees begin to shift to the back of the train so that if the incoming train did not
		stop in town, it would be forced to slow down.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>There was no need for that precaution; with a final blast of the
		steam horn, the incoming train came to a stop at the platform. Genie craned her neck to
		see if her husband?s car was hooked up in the back, and when she saw the crest of the
		Governor?s office on the side, she let out a very unladylike whoop and began to run
		to his car. The Sheriff had told her that the train with Josie aboard had been stopped a
		couple of miles out of town and that it would be held there until the Governor arrived.
		She prayed that the Judge had not taken matters into his own hands, having figured out
		that he could no longer hope to succeed in getting Josie extradited.</p>

		<p>The Governor?s footman opened the door of his car and
		extended the step so that the Governor could step down. When he did, he was nearly bowled
		over by Genie as she launched herself into his arms.</p>

		<p>"William, thank God you?re here! He took her already.
		But the Cherokees have stopped the train and they?re waiting for you to come. You
		have to hurry?"</p>

		<p>"Wait a minute, slow down. Let me get my land legs under
		me." His tone was light, but as he looked at her he realized how very worried she
		was. "Where is she? How do I get there?"</p>

		<p>"I?ll take you to her," John stepped forward and
		extended his hand which the Governor grasped. "I?m John Kenwood, Sheriff of
		Tahlequah."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca spoke highly of you," William said by way of
		acknowledgement that he knew that the Sheriff was an ally of Josie?s.</p>

		<p>"I?m afraid the train she?s on was stopped a few
		miles down the track by some of her supporters who believed ? as I do ? that it
		was not right to extradite her without a fair hearing. Judge Fellowes was anything but
		fair; he refused to listen to her witnesses. And he made sure to get her out of here
		before you could get here."</p>

		<p>"Well, let?s go hear her side of things, shall
		we?"</p>

		<p>"I have a horse saddled and ready to go. Your wife and some
		of Josie?s friends will follow in wagons, if that?s all right with you. I think
		they want to see for themselves that Miss Josie is all right."</p>

		<p>"I have very little luck in keeping my wife from doing
		exactly what she wants to do, Sheriff. If she?s determined to go, I sure don?t
		want to try and stop her. Let?s go." Indeed, Genie and the rest of Josie?s
		friends were already piling into two wagons that were tied up outside the station house.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"What in the world?" The Governor?s mouth dropped
		open at the sight of so many people surrounding the stilled train. The sea began to part
		as he and the Sheriff rode up, making a path that led to the car that housed the outlaw
		and her lover.</p>

		<p>"She has a lot of supporters," the Sheriff said, as if
		that explained how so many people had known to be on the tracks at the time the train was
		due to leave.</p>

		<p>"I see," the Governor said, leveling his gaze not at
		the assembled multitude but at John. The Sheriff shrugged; he counted himself among her
		staunchest supporters, and he did not care if the Governor knew it. The two men
		dismounted, and hands materialized out of the crowd to take the reins of their horses.
		When they reached the door of the car, a man stepped out of the crowd with a wooden box,
		which he placed in front of the door for a step. He climbed up on the box and wrenched the
		door open, then jumped down and stood aside for the Governor to enter. The people were
		eerily quiet; even the children stood silently watching as he mounted the step and entered
		the car.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The occupants of the car were aware that something was happening
		even before the door opened. The Judge had made a move to rise from his seat, but his
		former clerk pulled back the hammer on the gun that was pointed unswervingly at his head,
		and he fell back into his seat without a word. Rebecca had put Josie?s gun back in
		her bag. There was no need to keep Caleb covered; he had passed out shortly after
		finishing the bottle of wine. And the clerk had the Judge well in hand.</p>

		<p>Rebecca turned when the door was flung open, and when she saw
		William step into the car, followed by John she was on her feet and moving toward them.
		She threw her arms around William?s neck and kissed his cheek. "Am I ever glad
		to see you," she enthused. Then she stepped to where John stood and hugged and kissed
		him as well. The blush that suffused his cheeks was clear to anyone who looked.
		"John?I don?t even know what to say. She owes her life to you. How can we
		ever repay you?"</p>

		<p>"Just?live a long and happy life. That?s all I
		want."</p>

		<p>"Thank you. We will."</p>

		<p>The conductor tapped John on the shoulder, and the Sheriff turned
		to see a very angry looking man.</p>

		<p>"You the one responsible for keeping my train here?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Then I?ll thank you to take your business elsewhere
		and let us get underway."</p>

		<p>"Yes, of course. I?m sorry. Give me a few minutes to
		get the people off the tracks and we?ll let you go on your way." John stepped
		outside to talk to the Cherokee?s, and before he even returned the tracks were free
		of people. The sound of the steam engine firing up brought a cheer from the passengers who
		had been sitting for the better part of the day. But Josie knew they would all have a
		story to tell about Josie Hunter and the Cherokees who stopped the train when they reached
		their destination. It was probably the most excitement many of them had seen in their
		lives.</p>

		<p>Rebecca led the Governor to where Josie still sat, and she
		introduced them. "Funny. You don?t look like a cold blooded killer," he
		said lightly as he shook her hand.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "And you don?t look much like a Greek
		God, but you must be because that?s what Genie said she married." William threw
		back his head and laughed.</p>

		<p>"You should hear what she said about you," he quipped.</p>

		<p>"Will you please get these people off my train!" The
		conductor snapped at John, who in turn tapped the Governor on the shoulder.</p>

		<p>"We need to get off the train, sir. I?ll take Miss
		Josie?s bag if you will get Miss Rebecca?s."</p>

		<p>"All right. There?s just one thing I have to do
		first." He walked to where the Judge sat glowering and fuming. John had filled him in
		completely on the way to the train, and there was no doubt in his mind that this man had
		completely lost his objectivity ? if indeed he had ever had any ? and had no
		business sitting in judgement of his fellow man. "Mr. Fellowes, you are disbarred.
		Your license to practice law in the Territory of Oklahoma is revoked. And I suggest that
		if you hope to continue in the legal field at all that you do so as far away from here as
		you can get, as I plan to make sure that our neighboring states get an earful about you.
		Is that perfectly clear?"</p>

		<p>The Judge said nothing; he knew he was hopelessly outnumbered.
		The Governor turned back to Josie and offered her his arm. "Miss Hunter, I believe we
		need to vacate these premises before Attila the Hun over there tosses us out on our
		ears." The conductor scowled as Josie stood and took William?s arm.</p>

		<p>"That?s the best invitation I?ve had all
		day," she quipped. William collected Rebecca?s bag and the three of them made
		their way from the train. John paused to get the gun from the clerk and was on his way
		back when Rebecca poked her head in the door.</p>

		<p>"Can you arrest Caleb for something and bring him with you,
		John? I need time to contact my sister and get her out of that house before he gets back
		there."</p>

		<p>"Well, he?s drunk in a public place. I suppose I can
		hold him for a day or so on that." He pushed Caleb forward in his seat and put his
		arms under the sleeping man?s arms and around his chest. With a heave he pulled him
		up and dragged him to the door. Caleb never stirred even as he was handed out to several
		of the Cherokee?s who were still milling around beside the train. John grabbed
		Josie?s bag from the rack and jumped out of the car just as the whistle blew and the
		wheels began to move.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The parlor in the boarding house was completely packed with
		friends and well-wishers who came out to say good-bye to Josie and Rebecca. It had taken
		no time at all for the Governor to decide against extradition for Josie, and the
		celebration had begun shortly after the decision was announced. Rebecca sent a telegram to
		Katy telling her to come to Oklahoma where Genie had said she could stay indefinitely
		until Josie and Rebecca settled out west, at which time Katy would join them.</p>

		<p>Charles and Horace were playing song after song, and everyone was
		either singing along or dancing. Josie and Rebecca were both constantly being whisked away
		to dance with someone besides each other, but knowing that this may be the last time they
		may see these friends, they whirled and danced with everyone who asked. No one seemed to
		notice that most of the dancers were women, or if they noticed, they did not care.</p>

		<p>Josie turned to a tap on the shoulder to find Genie standing
		behind her, her hands outstretched. "I think it?s about my turn," Genie
		said with a smile. Josie nodded and pulled the smaller woman into her arms. They were
		playing a slow tune, and Genie?s head naturally rested on Josie?s shoulder, her
		body moving in perfect rhythm with the tall gunslinger. Josie felt a soft inhalation and a
		sigh before Genie pulled herself a bit farther away so she could look into the blue pools
		that were Josie?s eyes. "Sometimes," Genie said softly, "I wish we
		had?taken that next step in our relationship. I knew you wanted to; I could tell by
		the way that you looked at me. I wanted it to, but I was afraid. Can you forgive me for
		being such a coward?"</p>

		<p>"There?s nothing to forgive. I knew you loved me too. I
		always thought that if we had not been so tragically separated we would have become
		lovers. But that?s so long ago now. You have William and I have Rebecca, and
		we?re both happy. But you?ll always be the first woman that I loved, and the
		place you own in my heart no one can ever share." As the music ended, she kissed
		Genie on the forehead before allowing herself to be turned by yet another hand on her
		shoulder. This one belonged to Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"I heard that," the little blonde said softly.
		"And I know there is a part of you that will always belong to her." Josie opened
		her mouth to speak, but Rebecca touched her lips with her fingers to silence her.
		"No, it?s all right. I accept it. I could never ask you to let go of something
		so precious to you. All I ask is that you remember who loves you now, and tell me if there
		is ever anything I should be worried about. Promise me?"</p>

		<p>"You have nothing to worry about?"</p>

		<p>"Promise?"</p>

		<p>"I promise." The soft notes of "Beautiful
		Dreamer" began to play, and Josie held out her hand to Rebecca. "May I have this
		dance?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. And all the dances of my life." She stepped into
		her arms and they whirled into their future.</p>
