<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Conclusion -->

<p>Brooke rolled over and wrapped her arms around Sam's sleeping
form. She was warm and soft and Brooke never wanted to let go. And then it hit
her. She didn't have to; Sam wasn't going anywhere. Not now, not ever; Sam had
said as much. </p>
<p>("But I'm not going anywhere, I promise. My heart and soul are
yours for as long as you want them. A day, a week, a month, a year, forever.
Whatever you choose. You'll never lose me until the day you say good-bye.") </p>
<p>But Brooke had no intentions of ever saying good-bye until the
last breath left her body, preferably when she was old and grey and had lived a
fulfilling life with Sam at her side. She held on to Sam a little tighter,
buried her nose in Sam's thick brown hair and smiled at the hand God had dealt
her. </p>
<p>Looking back over her high school career, never in a million
years did she imagine she'd be lying where she was now, next to Sam deeply in
love. Well, she had been in love with Sam for a long time she just never thought
that things would work out the way that they did. Her life was, in reality to an
outside observer, imperfect. The life laid out in front of her, and Sam, was not
going to be an easy one. There were going to be hard times as well as good but
to Brooke, it was absolutely perfect. It was what she wanted and she wouldn't
change a thing. </p>
<p>"Sammy, you awake?" she whispered. Sam shifted in her arms. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh," Sam murmured back. Brooke chuckled. </p>
<p>"Oh really?" she teased. She felt Sam snicker back.
</p>
<p>"Really," Sam's sleep filled voice reached her ears. Sam
rolled over in Brooke's arms so that they were facing each other and put her
arms around Brooke's hips. She stared sleepily into Brooke's hazel eyes as
Brooke just smiled happily at her. </p>
<p>"What's up, Princess?" she asked. </p>
<p>"I'm happy, Sam," Brooke told her. Sam smiled back at her. </p>
<p>"That's good. So am I." </p>
<p>"Did you ever think we'd end up here together? In love?"
Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"Brooke, I've loved you in some way since I first layed eyes
on you in kindergarten. You were wearing a little pink dress and white gloves
with little matching shiny shoes. And you had long hair that was curled." Brooke
laughed. </p>
<p>"You remember all that?" she asked. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Harrison wasn't the only one taken with you," she giggled.
"Of course, he loved you right off the bat and I thought I hated you." Brooke
thought back for a minute. </p>
<p>"You were wearing a pair of blue overalls and a white shirt
with your hair in pigtails," she remembered Sam as well. "And if memory serves,
you dumped a pint of milk over my head that day." She mock glared at Sam. Sam
smiled sheepishly. </p>
<p>"And thus the rivalry began. I think I was jealous because
Harrison kept staring at you and talking to you. I guess it comes down to `I
started it'." </p>
<p>"Spiteful little five year old, weren't you?" Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"Yeah, should have dumped the milk over HIS head, though," Sam
giggled. Brooke brushed some hair away from Sam's face. </p>
<p>"We've come a long way, haven't we?" Brooke said more as a
statement. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Never thought I'd thank Nicole for her poor drivin skills but
yes, without her, I doubt we'd be here right now." Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"I don't know. We might have told each other eventually." Sam
shrugged. </p>
<p>"Maybe, but without the kick in the ass we both got, we might
not have. I remember how frightened I was of your reaction to how I felt,
Brooke. I think your rejection, or if you'd been horrified, it would have
destroyed me." </p>
<p>"I know what you mean, Sam. I sat on my feelings for you for
so long," Brooke admitted. </p>
<p>"Well, that's all behind us now. And we have the future to
look forward to," Sam pointed out, her voice full of hope. Brooke rested her
forehead against Sam's. </p>
<p>"I wonder what that future holds," Brooke whispered. Sam
smirked and kissed her slow and deep. </p>
<p>"I don't know, love, but I can't wait to find out," she said
as she reached down and pulled the covers up over their heads and lost herself
to Brooke. </p>
