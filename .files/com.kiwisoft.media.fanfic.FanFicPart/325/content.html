<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>Brooke walked around her room in her bra getting ready for
school. She really didn't feel like going in today having slept badly the night
before. She knew she had to get a handle on her dreams if she had any hope of
being awake enough to pass any classes this year. But things just seemed to be
getting out of her control and she had no one to talk to. </p>
<p>(I could talk to Nic?if I wanted to destroy myself in one fell
swoop) she thought humorlessly. (Mary Cherry, also a no. You know, I really need
to find better friends) She sighed heavily as she tossed a few shirts around
trying to find the one she wanted. </p>
<p>(Sam?) her heart stopped cold at that thought. (Somehow I
think talking to the school journalist, not to mention my soon-to-be stepsister
and worst enemy would be worse than talking to Nicole) She let out a frustrated
growl and flopped down on the bed. </p>
<p>Sam. That's where a frightening amount of her thoughts were
finding themselves lately, revolving around her reluctant housemate. Half the
time Brooke wanted to slap the other girl, Sam made her so mad her blood boiled.
The other half of the time, Brooke's blood boiled for an entirely different
reason where Sam was concerned. And poor Brooke didn't know what to do with
herself. </p>
<p>(Why is this happening to me?) she lamented, not for the first
time. Normally her dreams would have been highly enjoyable, if her partner in
them were, oh say, Heath Ledger or Paul Walker. But when she looked into the
face of the person bringing her to unimaginable heights of ecstacy, she stared
directly into Sam's beautiful face. She shuddered in delight as she remembered
the feel of Sam's lips on her own, the warmth and gentleness of Sam's hands and
the skill behind each of Sam's touches. She absently wondered if the real Sam
was anything like her dream counterpart but guiltily chased the thought away. </p>
<p>(I can't be thinking like that) she reminded herself even as
she blushed and the thoughts continued. (Oh God) she sighed. She had been aware
of how attractive Sam was even long before their parents ever met or became
involved with one another. She just chalked it up to appreciation for the female
form. She was always able to admit when another woman was attractive. Nicole was
pretty when she wasn't being evil, Lily had nice eyes, Carmen had nice skin,
etc. There was nothing more to it. But with Sam there was. And it didn't seem to
be going away. </p>
<p>She tried to think back to when her feelings for Sam had gone
from innocent to loving but couldn't exactly pinpoint it. It just seemed like
some sort of natural progression as she got to know Sam better and they fought
less. Brooke loved to be around her, it made her day complete. Just the very
thought of spending time with Sam either at home or at school was enough to send
a small jolt of adrenaline through her system and her heart to race. She adored
hearing Sam's voice, her laugh, and the perfume Sam wore was a safety smell to
Brooke now. Whenever she smelled it, she automatically thought of and looked
around for Sam, reguardless of where she was. And she was always disappointed if
it wasn't Sam there. </p>
<p>(I am so sunk) Brooke realized. (And I have absolutely no clue
as to what to do) She considered talking to Jane and just leaving out names.
That was still an option, she just wasn't sure yet if she was going to take that
route. While she was comfortable with Jane and loved her like a mother, exposing
her sexual preference as anything other than straight to anyone was a bit
daunting as of now. </p>
<p>A soft rap on the door followed by it opening broke Brooke
from her thoughts and Sam strolled in dressed in a white tank top and all ready
halfway through a sentence. </p>
<p>"Seen my blue sweater? I think Mom mixed up our laundry
again," she said as she came to a stop and belatedly realized Brooke's state of
undress. Brooke glared at her even as her heart raced so fast she thought she
was in danger of having a heart attack. </p>
<p>"Ever heard of `privacy', Sam?" she snapped harsher than she
meant to but unable to stop herself. Sam blushed and looked away. Brooke found
the reaction both endearing and slightly wounding. </p>
<p>"Uh, sorry," she apologized sheepishly. She looked back at
Brooke focusing her eyes on Brooke's vaguely angry hazel ones and not several
inches lower. "Have you seen my sweater?" she repeated. Brooke rolled her eyes
and leaned over to grab the sweater in question. She tossed it at Sam hitting
her in the face. </p>
<p>"Here," she sighed. She had been kind of hoping for a better
reaction from Sam but figured she had been hoping for too much. Sam pulled the
sweater over her head. </p>
<p>"Thanks," she mumbled. Brooke arched an eyebrow at her.
</p>
<p>"Are you going to leave or stand there and watch me finish
getting dressed?" she asked sarcastically. Sam shifted uncomfortably on her
feet. </p>
<p>"I'm leaving, and I'm sorry I barged in on you like this," she
said as she backpedaled towards the door. Brooke smiled and couldn't resist at
least one comment. </p>
<p>"Oh, feel free to barge in anytime, Sam," she smirked as Sam
jumped. "A few minutes sooner and you would have gotten a REAL show." Sam's eyes
narrowed. </p>
<p>"You're a real jerk, McQueen, you know that? I said I was
sorry. There's no reason to act like an ass," she snarled. Brooke stood up and
approached Sam who stood her ground. Brooke felt her adrenaline surge as Sam
glared at her. (Oh, are we going to play, Sammy?) </p>
<p>"Like what you see, Sammy?" she taunted. Her inner self
screamed at her to shut up but her mouth seemed to have suddenly acquired a mind
of its own. Sam gaped at her with an expression akin to horror and shock.
</p>
<p>"God, get over yourself you narcissistic twit!" she yelled at
Brooke. "First off, you ain't all that. Second, you're not my type." Brooke
swallowed the hurt those comments caused her and continued to advance on Sam. </p>
<p>"Oh really?" she asked sarcastically. Sam leaned so that they
were nose to nose. Brooke's body was fairly humming with energy. </p>
<p>"Really," Sam growled back matter-of-factly. Brooke could feel
the Sam's warm breath splashing across her face and it took everything she had
not to kiss Sam right there. She started at Sam's lips as she licked her own
however, a move not missed by Sam. </p>
<p>"What has gotten into you lately?" Sam asked, calmer. Brooke
shook her head to clear it and backed away a few steps. </p>
<p>"Nothing," she responded evenly as she pulled on a shirt. Sam
shook her head and reached for the doorknob. </p>
<p>"OK, fine. But for God's sake, Brooke, get some and unwind
before you go postal and take us all out," she advised as she left the room.
Brooke spun around and looked at the spot Sam had vacated in shock. </p>
<p>(Get some? God, am I THAT bad?) she wondered embarrassed. She
then smirked in Sam's direction. </p>
<p>"Gee Sammy, was that an offer?" she asked the empty space. </p>
