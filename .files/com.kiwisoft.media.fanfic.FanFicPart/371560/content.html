<P><B>Authors Note: This is picnic day... YAY.. read and review.. thank you..</B></p>
<P><B>Disclaimer: I own nothing</B></p>
<P>As the day of the picnic came, Olivia stood at the edge of the park, she could see all the people from the class in the distance, some where playing soccer, if you could actually call it soccer. Olivia laughed at that thought, it was something Viola would say, Olivia sighed, Viola was the reason Olivia was here. To make it right between the two, if Olivia couldn't get a relationship out of Viola she was at least going to amend their friendship.</p>
<P>Walking through the park, Olivia spotted Viola dressed as Sebastian, at the far end of the park, standing facing the food. Walking over to her, Olivia breathed in deeply, this was going to be hard, it was easier when Viola wasn't looking at her.</p>
<P>"Hi", said Olivia, "Look don't turn around there are a few things I need to say first".</p>
<P>Sebastian froze, he recognized Olivia's voice instantly, his surprise had just been blown, he nodded and listened as she continued.</p>
<P>"Look I'm really sorry about what happened", said Olivia, looking at Viola.</p>
<P>Sebastian was about to turn around when Olivia stopped him.</p>
<P>"No don't say anything, I was in the wrong and I'm sorry, and I will understand if you never want to talk to me again, Viola", said Olivia, sadly.</p>
<P>Sebastian was about to turn around for the third time, when Olivia said Viola. He froze, Olivia was apologizing to Viola, who Olivia seemed to think he was. Sebastian nodded for her to continue.</p>
<P>"Look I just wanted to tell you that, I know we can never be more than friends, but I think you should know that... I love you", said Olivia, Sebastian almost choked on the sausage roll he had been eating. Olivia loved his sister, he listened intently as Olivia continued.</p>
<P>"And I can't do this to Sebastian anymore, but he's being so sweet but it just won't work, I'm going to tell him, but before I do I just wanted to know if there was any way you would return my feelings", said Olivia, she was almost crying now, Viola hadn't said anything and Olivia was beginning to feel that she was too late.</p>
<P>Sebastian sighed, as he thought over what Olivia had said, she was right it wouldn't work, but he still couldn't believe that Olivia was in love with Viola.</p>
<P>"Say something, Viola", said Olivia, she was growing impatient and it hurt more not knowing, than it ever would knowing that they could never be.</p>
<P>Olivia grabbed Viola and spun her around, only problem was, it wasn't Viola dressed as Sebastian it was...</p>
<P>"Sebastian!", Olivia shrieked.</p>
<P>"Surprise", said Sebastian, putting his hands up.</p>
<P>"What? Wheres...", Olivia let the words trail off as she realized what she had said to Sebastian, who she thought was Viola.</p>
<P>"I don't know where Viola is... but I think we should go talk to her", said Sebastian, comfortingly.</p>
<P>Olivia looked up at him as he put an arm around her, and lead her out of the park.</p>
<P>"You know Sebastian your being really sweet about this", said Olivia, as she hugged his side.</p>
<P>"Yeah well, it figures that I get good at the whole boyfriend thing just as you realize your in love with my sister", said Sebastian with a laugh.</p>
<P>Olivia smiled, Sebastian was sweet and she felt semi-bad for dumping him, but she couldn't deny her feelings for Viola any more and by the look of things Sebastian could accept that. But just to be on the save side she had to ask.</p>
<P>"So... your okay with this?", asked Olivia as they walked to Viola's.</p>
<P>"Should I not be?", asked Sebastian, with another laugh.</p>
<P>"Its your life Liv, not mine", said Sebastian.</p>
<P>"However it is my sister", said Sebastian on second thought, Olivia whacked him playfully.</p>
<P>"No seriously, whats with that?", asked Sebastian, curious as to what had sparked Olivia's interests in Viola.</p>
<P>"Well I don't know, shes cute, smart and funny, and she actually pays attention to me", said Olivia with a laugh as Sebastian playfully mocked pain,at the comment.</p>
<P>When they arrived at Viola's dorm room, Sebastian knocked on the door first, and Duke answered, he also didn't have shirt on. Olivia felt the jealously boil up inside her, Viola had said they were just friends, but a picture is worth a thousand words. Olivia mentally swore as she remembered the night after their second class, Viola had come round to find Sebastian in almost the exact same state.</p>
<P>Duke just stared at them both, Sebastian was about to say something, when Olivia lunged at Duke, jumping on his back as he tried to duck. Holding Duke in a head lock, whilst wrapping her legs around his waist to hold herself up, Olivia began to repeatedly beating him over the head with her fist.</p>
<P>"You son of a..." yelled Olivia as she held onto Duke.</p>
<P>Duke just trying to fend her off, and all the yelling had caused a sleeping Viola to awaken, walking into the room she found, Sebastian feebly trying to pry Olivia from Duke's back and Duke just trying to protect his head as Olivia continued to beat him. The whole situation would have been rather comical if Duke had down something wrong and if Viola didn't feel like her heart had been ripped in two. Everyone was so busy trying to stop or start the fight, that no one realized Viola's entrance and exit, they all froze as the bedroom door slammed shut, realizing their silent guest.</p>
