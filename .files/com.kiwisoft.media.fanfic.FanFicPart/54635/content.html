<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Two -->

<p>With the deadly aerosol can in hand, Gage Ballant rushed back inside the cabin, jumping over the couch toward the ringing telephone only to knock it further away. Scrambling on the floor, Gage grabbed the phone, now out of breath, answered it. "Hello."</p>
		<p>"Are you training for a marathon, being chased or just clumsy, as usual?" Straightening back up, Gage smiled at the familiar voice greeting her.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"I am not clumsy." Gage strongly denied the ribbing that was being served.</p>
		<p>"Surely, it can't be the only other thing I'm thinking of because you're up there alone, right?" The voice on the telephone taunted.</p>
		<p>"Very funny." Gage frowned. "And for your information, it's chasing."</p>
		<p>"I wish I was there to see who was doing the chasing... is it you or the same geese that were after you a few weeks ago?" The sound of laughter echoed through the telephone recoiling Gage to remember the unpleasant thought that fleetingly crossed her mind of being chased by a flock of geese. </p>
		<p>Gage jumped up, with the telephone in one hand and a can of wasp killer in the other, determined to take her avenge on the wasps that had decided to take up residence on the front porch. "It's a good thing you're not here. I'm in pursuit of your favorite insect. You know the ones that
			<i>chased</i> you around mercilessly until you were stung, swelling up like a balloon." Gage said letting her lighthearted laugh drift through the telephone.
		</p>
		<p>"Hey, I'm allergic to wasps." The unpleasant memory caused Mark to shift uncomfortably in his leather chair. He picked up an antique pen, tapping it on his equally antique desk. "Remember where I left the EpiPen just in case you end up getting stung. It can be deadly," he added seriously.</p>
		<p>Running her hand nervously through her short blonde hair, Gage was immediately upset with her teasing words to her friend and now partner, Mark Calico. When Mark offered his cabin for Gage to write a new screenplay, they came up together to check the place out. The very first day Mark was stung and would have died if he had not already known he was allergic to wasps and always carried EpiPen with him, also having a spare at the cabin just in case. EpiPen stopped the inflammation that spread throughout his body upon being stung; which started to shut down all his major body functions.</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Mark." Gage apologized then offered. "I don't think I'm allergic though."</p>
		<p>"Have you ever been stung?"</p>
		<p>"I don't remember really. I don't think so." Gage was now more than ever determined to eradicate the vicious little creatures that had caused her friend harm. </p>
		<p>Sensitive to his friend's regret, Mark changed the subject and asked. "How's the story going?"</p>
		<p>With keen green eyes, Gage took careful aim and sent a direct hit, flooding the wasp's nest, saturating it with the deadly spray. The aerosol can had a spray distance of up to twenty feet so Gage was safely tucked just inside the cabin door. "Great, actually, almost finished with it. Needs some editing though and you'll have to read it."</p>
		<p>"If it's anything like the first one, then were in business." the CEO of Calico Corporation, a worldwide network, said as he gazed out his 70
			<sup>th</sup> floor high rise office window to the New York streets below.
		</p>
		<p>"Listen, Mark, are you sure you want to venture into film making. I mean, for me, it's a chance of a lifetime, but you have so many other businesses and things." </p>
		<p>Mark gently cut Gage off. "Those other businesses were handed over to me by my grandfather. I want to do something on my own. That's why I was on that board to judge the screenplay competition. Its always interested me and... I found myself a great writer on top of it."</p>
		<p>"Oh, really, are you seeing another writer behind my back?" Gage pretended to pout. "Because if you are, I'll just call up that same grandfather and have him yank his grandson by the ear. You know, he likes me."</p>
		<p>"He loves you." Mark corrected her, thinking fondly of his grandfather who still lived in England at the ripe old age of 90. "No, you're the only writer for me."</p>
		<p>"You may want to reconsider after reading my screenplay." Gage felt confident it was a good story, but this was, after all, a new style of writing for the three times published author.</p>
		<p>"I doubt that. By the way, your latest murder/mystery book just hit the top ten." Having taken over Gage's writing contract to publish her work, Mark's new company, Shadow Publishing, had its first bestseller.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Pre-occupied by the news of her book's success, Gage lost sight of a renegade wasp making a beeline for her. Before she could secure the door, the little bugger slipped inside the cabin. A trained eye tracked the wasp curling busy circles through the living area. "Great news. But I gotta go. The enemy has infiltrated the encampment and I've got a seek and destroy mission at hand." The author chased after the intruder barely hearing Mark's farewell as she spied the wasp fly into the master bedroom landing on the king size bed. Flipping the telephone on the couch, she declared all out war. "Oh, no, you don't. Not in my bed." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She slammed the aerosol can on the kitchen counter and reached for her weapon of choice, yanking if from the side of the kitchen cabinet. With fly swatter in hand, she stealthily pursued her adversary. Gage's sharp eyes surveyed the interior upon entering the master bedroom. She scanned the area immediately surrounding the huge bed located in the center of the room. Upon seeing no unidentified flying objects, Gage gracefully moved to the edge of the adjoining bathroom entrance. Peeking around the corner, she searched the room shifting her eyes from the counter to the large jet tub, next to the glass encased shower and finally checking the dressing area with no results. </p>
		<p>As Gage stepped in, a buzzing object jetted by her. Twisting around quickly, she stalked the invader out of the master bedroom into the second bedroom just down the short hallway. The high cabin ceiling gave the wasp plenty of airspace, circling around one of the two twin beds placed on either side of the room. "I've got you now."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Gage leaped up on the twin bed on the right just when the wasp diverted its direction to the other side of the room. Jumping from one bed to the other one, she cocked her arm and swatted at the wasp.
			<i>Damn, almost. </i>
		</p>
		<p>It made its escape past the door, taking a direct route though the open kitchen area, once around the living room then coming to rest on the screen door facing. "Come on you cagey little thing. Hold still just a little bit longer." Arm cocked and ready to strike, the fly swatter came barreling down on a direct path to its target. The lucky insect came within inches of its life before it quickly ducked out a small opening in the screen. When the fly swatter finally landed, it found no one home. </p>
		<p>Gage pushed open the screen door, green eyes following the wasp on its happy flight to freedom. The smart wasp had lived to fight another day. Letting the door slam behind her, the defeated writer plopped down on the couch spying the discarded telephone.
			<i>I don't think I'll tell Mark how this little encounter turned out. It would pleasure him way too much. </i>
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>She zoomed around the first class cabin in her own flight of freedom. Dani loved to fly and was desperately encouraging her little brother to follow suit, but to no avail. The more she tried the more Derek shied deeper into his mother's grasp. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Not having been able to reach her mom as they waited for their airplane, Lacy tried again, successfully this time, connecting with her mother while in flight. Now, she was having a hard time concentrating on her telephone conversation with her mother. "Mom, hold on just a second, will you?" Turning her attention to her excited daughter, she said. "Dani, why don't you come sit down next to me?"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Oblivious to her mother's gentle command, the self-proclaimed pilot smiled happily as she continued her flight though the aisle as other passengers delighted in the rambunctious antics of the young girl. Her infectious personality and laughter captured the other first class passengers when she made one more pass by her brother. "Vrrrroom. Come on, Derek. Fly like a plane. Fly like a plane." Dani's shoulder length dark hair swayed from side to side while flapping her arms, dipping them back and forth wildly. Finally, forcing a reluctant smile from her brother.</p>
		<p>Firmly, Lacy drew her daughter's undivided attention. "Dani!"</p>
		<p>Shoulders plummeted downward crowned by a crestfallen face as Dani spiraled back to her seat next to her mother. She looked apologetically at her audience when her performance came to an abrupt halt. A young steward, witnessing the show, followed her down the aisle. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Before she was even settled in her seat, Dani turned to her mother. "Can I go get Grace? She's way in the back and I'm sure she doesn't have anyone to talk to."</p>
		<p>Finding it hard to deny her daughter anything, Lacy looked to the steward for help with the proffered question. "Is there any way our friend could come up here with us?"</p>
		<p>Hesitant, the newly hired steward shook his head slightly while thinking. "I don't know, ma'am, if we can allow that. Everyone has their assigned seats and we don't...."</p>
		<p>Dani jumped in before another word was spoken. "We have plenty of seats up here. Look. Right there." Pointing to the seat directly across from her. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Scanning his nametag, Lacy offered. "I could pay the difference, if that's the problem, Tim." A brilliant smile accentuated the added, "Please." And the imploring look from the well-known actress settled the issue.</p>
		<p>Giving in, Tim agreed. "Sure."</p>
		<p>Shooting up from her seat, Dani grabbed the young man's hand and bolted down the aisle in search of her friend. "I have to go with you since I know what she looks like." With a quick glance back to the steward, Dani continued. "She's old and has wrinkles all over her face, but she says it gives her character. I don't really know about that though she is rather funny at times."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy returned to her long forgotten telephone conversation with her mother. "Oh, sorry, mom. I guess you heard."</p>
		<p>"She hasn't changed much, has she? Of course, I could be wrong. What has it been? Now, let's see, almost a whole year since I've seen my grandkids." Lynn Lewis inserted making her point crystal clear.</p>
		<p>"Message received, mom." With assurance, Lacy continued. "After our little vacation, we'll try to stop by for a visit."</p>
		<p>"Try?" Lynn's voice housed disappointment. Ever since her actor daughter hit the big time with her television show, Lynn and her husband, Daniel, had rare sightings of their daughter and her children.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Okay. It's a definite visit then." Lacy hoped David wouldn't object and come up with another one of his thousand reasons to thwart her plans for a little family time.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>With that extracted promise from her daughter, Lynn, perked up. "Dan will be ecstatic to hear that. Now, how's Derek? With all that carrying on I heard over the phone, you don't have to tell me how Dani is doing."</p>
		<p>Brushing warm lips across her son's forehead, Derek smiled at his mother. "Just fine. Glad to have his mommy around full time now."</p>
		<p>"Is that the plan?" Lynn hoped her daughter was sincere. Having raised five kids, three boys and two girls of her own, Lynn knew the importance of a mother's role in their lives. With the good, steady construction job her husband had, Lynn had the luxury of staying at home with her children, something not afforded to many moms these days.</p>
		<p>Lacy watched her daughter return with Grace in hand. As they settled down in their seats, she confirmed her mother's hopes. "Yes. At least, after I get this next movie in. Then I intend to take off a few years. Maybe just do some guest spots or a movie a year."</p>
		<p>"And no more series?" Lynn asked hopefully.</p>
		<p>"Certainly not like this last one. It was too time consuming and exhausting." For six years, five days a week and twelve hours a day, Lacy and her co-star labored to make ?
			<i>Crackdown'</i> the number one rated show four years in a row. Even in its last two seasons, it stubbornly remained in the top ten. It was time to call a halt before it destroyed her sanity and worse yet adversely affected the lives of her children. She realized it had already taken a toll on her kids and her marriage. So, Lacy simply refused to re-negotiate her contract. Instead, she did commit to making a movie for the Hollywood mogul, Ron Griffen, with the persistent urging of her producer husband and with the understanding that she had completed her commitment to Griffen Studios. "Anyway, we should have plenty of time for visits in the coming years."
		</p>
		<p>Satisfied with her daughter's answer, Lynn changed the subject. "Honey, why'd you call?"</p>
		<p>"I just wanted to hear a friendly voice." Her mother picked up the desolate feeling in her daughter's sad voice.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Is it David?" Lynn pinpointed the problem.</p>
		<p>With a deep sigh, Lacy admitted. "Yeah, David. He couldn't come with us yet. And, we kinda left it.... bad."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Targeting in on the frequent problems between her daughter and her husband, Lynn recognized Lacy's latest decision to quit the show must have triggered an even greater distance between them. David was obsessed with both their careers especially his and, Lacy, once she had tasted fame realized that not all the flavors associated with it were sweet. "Honey, I suggest you and David have a heart to heart talk about your future. Mostly about what you both want out of a career."</p>
		<p>"We will. Hopefully, next week." Suddenly not wanting to talk about this sore issue, Lacy capped the subject closed. "Anyway...."</p>
		<p>The silence that fell between mother and daughter spoke volumes and Lynn took the hint. "Lacy, if you or the kids need anything, you know who to call. Okay? You know, your dad and I both love you."</p>
		<p>"I do." Warmed by her mother's words, a small smile sparked her ivory features before it descended quickly after she said goodbye.</p>
		<p>While talking gleefully to her old friend, with knowing blue eyes Dani glimpsed the forlorn expression that permeated her mother's face. Ever her mother's savior, Dani spieled out any kind of nonsense that would deliberately take her mother's mind off whatever dreadful thoughts that plagued her. "Mom, did you know that Grace built airplanes while her husband flew them in the big one?"</p>
		<p>Curiously drawn from her dark musings, Lacy asked. "Big one?"</p>
		<p>"World War II." Dani wondered why her mother even had to ask.
			<i>Didn't every one know about the big one?</i>
