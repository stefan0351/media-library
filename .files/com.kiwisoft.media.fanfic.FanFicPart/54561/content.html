
<p>"Sooooo, good pizza huh?" Sam asked, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah…it was great."  Brooke replied, smiling nervously at Sam.</p>

<p>They were approaching the house, hand in hand.  At dinner they had
talked and laughed and played footsie under the table.  Everything
had been fine and they had lingered longer than they had planned to.
As they walked home in the warm evening air they came to the
individual realisation that they were nervous about what was to come
later…if you'll pardon the expression.  Brooke thought back over the
various dreams she'd had.  It was one thing to be a great dream
lover, it was quite another to be one in real life.  Sam, meanwhile
was trying to remember the movie `Bound'.  Lily had made her watch it
one day because she insisted the woman in it was a dead ringer for
her.  Sam couldn't see it herself.  They stopped walking, they had
reached the door.</p>

<p>"You wanna come in for a coffee?" Sam asked playfully.</p>

<p>"Coffee?  I was promised a mouth-watering dessert," said Brooke,
enjoying the flush that came over Sam's face as she heard her brazen
words from earlier.  "I hope you're not all out of dessert."</p>

<p>Sam put her arms around Brooke's waist and pulled her into a loose
embrace.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I saved a special piece, just for you."  And she leaned in
and kissed her deeply.  The nerves seemed to flow out of their bodies
as they kissed.  It was the reassurance they needed.  There really
was no need to worry, they knew that they would be safe and loved by
the other no matter how inadequate they turned out to be in the
bedroom department.</p>

<p>Brooke became aware of a strange noise coming from the door.  She
realised that it was being opened from the inside.  Luckily Sam had
noticed this a fraction earlier than Brooke.  She abruptly ripped her
mouth away from Brooke's and removed her hand from underneath her
shirt where it seemed to have gone all on its own.  The door opened
fully just as Sam was extricating herself from the embrace, smiling
warmly at Brooke who stood frozen in place.</p>

<p>"Well, thanks for paying for dinner Brooke, that was really great.
Oh hey Mom, I was just thanking Brooke for paying for dinner tonight."</p>

<p>Jane stood in bewilderment.  She looked at Brooke who also appeared
to be in some kind of daze.  </p>

<p>"You were thanking her by hugging her?"  </p>

<p>With anyone else this wouldn't be out of the ordinary but when it
came to Sam and Brooke, physical contact was more likely to mean a
right hook than a hug.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Is that wrong?  I was showing my gratitude…I'm trying to be a
more emotionally accessible person and I thought that hugging might
bring me closer to people.  So I decided Brooke was to be my test
subject." </p>

<p>She looked at Brooke and silently urged her to respond.  Although she
did look really cute standing there looking all shocked.  Brooke
eventually snapped out of her stupor and tried to think of something
to say.</p>

<p>"I…uh…I don't mind helping Sam to become a better person Jane, God
knows she can use all the help she can get."  Brooke smiled sweetly
at Sam's tight-lipped expression.</p>

<p>"Well, usually I don't like testing things on animals but I figured
with the amount of beauty products you use on your body nothing can
hurt you."</p>

<p>"Animals?" Brooke inquired through gritted teeth.</p>

<p>"A bitch is an animal right, Mom?"  </p>

<p>Sam looked to Jane for confirmation, her expression one of innocent
curiosity.  Brooke's expression remained neutral but she managed to
give Sam's thigh a good pinch.  Sam squeaked and bent down to rub her
injury.  Jane listened to this exchange with a mixture of emotions.
She was obviously fed up with the bickering.  But she was a little
relieved as well, seeing Sam hugging Brooke was…well it was just too
strange, this was back to normal and it felt comfortable.</p>

<p>"OK you two, cut it out." </p>

<p>See that was what moms were supposed to say.  Jane stepped aside and
let the girls enter, giving each other very strange looks.  They were
heading for the stairs when Jane caught them.</p>

<p>"Uh uh uh!  Into the den, you'll never guess what Mike found when we
were clearing out the attic."</p>

<p>But they didn't have to guess as a very naked, nude Brooke loomed
into view on the TV screen.  OK, so she was three but that didn't
make her any less naked.  Jane sat on the couch beside Mike while the
girls remained standing behind them.  Sam guffawed at the sight of
Brooke running around the garden with a water gun pretending to be a
Charlie's Angel.  Brooke was less than amused by the whole thing.</p>

<p>"Daddy!  What are you doing?  I'm naked!" she whined.</p>

<p>"Oh come on honey, you were just a baby.  And anyway, look, you're so
cute!"  Mike joined in with Sam's laughter as little Brooke fell flat
on her face in a sandbox.</p>

<p>"Yeah Brooke," said Sam, wiping away tears of laughter. "You're
adorable, no clothes is a good look on you."</p>

<p>Brooke raised her eyebrows and moved in very close to Sam.  She spoke
in a low voice so only Sam could hear.</p>

<p>"Well you better take a good look because if you don't stop laughing
that's the only chance you'll get to see me naked tonight." </p>

<p>Sam was immediately contrite and really, really tried to control her
laughter.  But when little Brooke, still nude, started barking at the
neighbour's dog she couldn't help herself and collapsed, leaning on
the back of the sofa for support while her body was racked with
laughter.  Brooke stood tapping her foot impatiently until the video
had finished and the laughing had come to an eventual halt.</p>

<p>"So Jane, do you have any footage of little Sammy?  Cuz I believe
it's only fair that I see it."</p>

<p>"No, we don't."  Sam said, a little too quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes we do Sa…"</p>

<p>"No.  We.  Don't." Sam said very definitely, giving her mother an
unmistakable look that said `Don't you dare.'  </p>

<p>Jane had seen the look before and was impervious to its power.  She
turned to Brooke with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes Brooke, we have a couple of tapes of Sam.  But my personal
favourite is Sam's own special rendition of `The Sound of Music' in
the bathtub when she was five.  This would be bad enough but Sam
can't hit a note to save her life so it's this squawking, whiny, out
of tune…"</p>

<p>"OK OK, we get the picture mom, I can't sing.  And we don't have to
see it because you described it beautifully there."</p>

<p>"Oh I think I have to see it." said Brooke, gleefully nodding at
Jane. </p>

<p>"It's in one of the boxes in the garage.  I'll look it out and we can
watch it tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Brooke, looking Sam defiantly in the eye.  "I can't
wait to see it."  </p>

<p>Sam tried to put on a `whatever' expression, but the colour of her
face gave away her embarrassment. </p>

<p>"So what are you girls going to do now?  You want to watch the movie
we rented?" asked Mike.</p>

<p>The girls knew what their answer would be but felt it was only polite
to consider the offer.</p>

<p>"What movie is it Dad?"</p>

<p>"Dangerous Liaisons."</p>

<p>"Uh, no thanks, I saw the updated version…a couple of times."</p>

<p>"Yeah, me too, but thanks for asking Mike." </p>

<p>Sam smiled.  Mike was a little confused at Sam's warm behaviour
towards him but decided just to accept it.  Teenage girls were a
mystery that was best left alone the majority of the time.  Brooke
and Sam stood for a minute, neither sure of how to say they were
going to go upstairs together.</p>

<p>"So…uh…do you want me to show you that thing?"</p>

<p>"That thing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, that thing, Lauryn Hill." said Sam, grinning at Brooke's
failure to follow her hint.</p>

<p>"Oh, right, sure." </p>

<p>"It's in my room." </p>

<p>Sam's grin had turned sultry and alluring and Brooke was having a
hard time trying not to grab her and ravish her right there on the
floor.</p>

<p>"OK, let's go then."  </p>

<p>Brooke grabbed Sam's hand and pulled her towards the stairs.  The
parents watched their departure with some confusion.  But then they
decided to leave well enough alone.  They were getting along, best
not to ask too many questions.  And with that thought they popped in
the videocassette and sat back to enjoy big frocks and scary wigs for
a couple of hours.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p> Sam leaned against the door to her room after checking that it was
securely locked, for the third time.  Brooke watched her from her
position on the edge of the bed.  She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"C'mere.  I'm pretty sure it's locked."</p>

<p>Sam walked towards her, taking her hand before sitting on the bed
beside her.  Brooke wrapped her free arm around Sam's shoulders and
drew her into the heat of her body.  Sam melted into Brooke, laying
her head on her shoulder.  They stayed that way for a few minutes,
not speaking, just holding each other.  Then Sam turned her head
slightly and pressed a kiss to the pulse point in Brooke's neck.  Sam
sat up and took Brooke's face into both of her hands before kissing
her fully on the mouth.  Brooke looked at Sam's face and knew
instinctively that she was ready.  Brooke returned the kiss.  She
turned her body and gently urged Sam backwards onto the bed so that
she was lying down with Brooke partially on top of her.  </p>

<p>They continued to kiss.  Heart rates increased, breathing became
quick and erratic.  Brooke allowed her hand to gently brush the
buttons of Sam's shirt.  She looked up to gain Sam's consent.  She
watched as Sam's eyes darkened until they were almost black with
desire.  She took this as consent.  Slowly and carefully she undid
each button before pushing the material back off Sam's shoulders.
Sam sat up slightly and shrugged the shirt off.  This left only a
black silk bra to be dealt with.  Brooke leaned down and kissed the
swell of Sam's breast.  She felt Sam inhale sharply and quickly
looked up into her face to make sure she was still OK with
everything.  The hand that came up behind Brooke's neck, gently
pushing her back to her previous position told her all she needed to
know.  She reached around and unhooked Sam's bra, unveiling her
breasts to the cool air.  She grazed one of them with her finger and
watched in wonder as the nipple contracted under her touch.  She
leaned in and tasted the nipple.  </p>

<p>Sam felt herself slipping, losing control…and for the first time in
her life she didn't mind this one little bit.  She looked down at
Brooke's head working wonders on her body and suddenly felt the need
to feel her skin on her.  She tugged at the sweater Brooke was
wearing.  Brooke glanced up and grinned.  She moved her arms to allow
Sam to slip the sweater off more easily.  Sam was thrilled to see
that Brooke was not wearing a bra.  She pulled Brooke back down on
top of her, marvelling at the softness of the skin pressing against
her own.  She brought up a hand to cup one of Brooke's breasts and
watched as the blonde's eyes closed and a moan escaped from her
mouth.  Sam brought their lips together in a passionate kiss as she
continued to knead Brooke's breast.</p>

<p>Brooke's hand travelled down Sam's toned abdomen and came to rest on
the waistband of her jeans.  She left it there so she could gauge
Sam's reaction to this development.  The reaction was not quite what
she had expected.  Sam started to laugh.  It began as a giggle but
quickly escalated into a full-blown laugh.  She buried her face in
Brooke's shoulder to muffle the sound but Brooke was hyper aware of
the vibrations running through the body beneath her own.  She failed
to see what was so funny and as Sam continued laughing Brooke became
more and more worried.  Had she done something wrong?  Was Sam
laughing at her body?  Was she that ugly?  She began to sit up,
attempting to cover herself with an arm.  Sam realised what Brooke
was thinking and quickly reached up to stop her retreat.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?"  Brooke asked, finally.</p>

<p>"It's not you…"  Sam really tried to stifle her laughter in order to
reassure Brooke that it had nothing to do with her.  "God, Brooke,
how could you even think I was laughing at your body?  You are the
single most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life…I mean that
most sincerely."  She managed to keep her face straight while saying
this.  To reinforce her sentiment she leaned over and kissed Brooke's
nose.  Brooke seemed satisfied that her figure had not been the
source of Sam's mirth.  But she was still curious to find out what it
was.</p>

<p>"OK then, what were you laughing at?  If you were thinking about me
in that stupid video again I'll…"  Sam as shaking her head, unable to
speak as the laughter once again took over.  This time it was
infectious and Brooke found herself laughing along.  She pulled Sam
into a tight hug as they both shook with laughter.  Once the hilarity
had died down somewhat Brooke found her voice.</p>

<p>"OK, I'm not letting go of you until you tell me why you were
laughing."  She tightened her arms around Sam.</p>

<p>"Is that supposed to be a bad thing?  `Cause it doesn't really work
as a threat…ugh."  Sam's breath was taken away as Brooke's
deceptively strong arms squeezed her in a bear hug.  "OK, OK."  she
managed to squeak out.</p>

<p>Brooke released her hold on Sam and waited impatiently to hear the
response.</p>

<p>"I…well, I was just thinking that if I'd…known this morning that this
was gonna happen I'd have…chosen my underwear with more care."</p>

<p>"What?  What do you mean?  Is it old?  Is it all washed out?  Oh God,
they don't have holes in them do they?"  </p>

<p>"No!  Ummmm, let's just say…there's a picture on them."</p>

<p>Brooke grinned wickedly and lunged for Sam's crotch.  Sam caught her
hands and pulled them away shrieking `No!'.  Brooke grappled with her
and it soon turned into a game of topless wrestling.</p>

<p>"Come on Sammy, you know I'm gonna see them sooner or later…"  Brooke
gasped out.  </p>

<p>Sam considered this for a minute before deciding that the statement
was probably true.  She stopped struggling and flopped back on the
bed, throwing an arm over her eyes in a dramatic gesture of defeat.</p>

<p>"OK then, but I'm warning you, it's not a pretty sight." she said,
still breathless from the wrestling.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled triumphantly and placed a kiss on Sam's forehead before
moving down and undoing her button.  She had just moved on to the
zipper when a sharp knock on the door caused her to spring away from
Sam like she'd been scalded.  Sam sat bolt upright on the bed, panic-
stricken.</p>

<p>"Sam?  Honey, Harrison is here to see you, I brought him up."</p>

<p>"Uh, just a second mom!"  Sam called, trying desperately not to sound
like she'd been involved in a dangerous liaison with her stepsister
to be.  That same stepsister was slipping her sweater back on.  Sam
thought she'd better do the same, quickly.  She looked around
frantically.</p>

<p>"Where is my bra?" she hissed at Brooke.</p>

<p>"How would I know?  Look, you're not exactly Dolly Parton, nobody's
gonna notice if you don't wear it for one night…just get your shirt
back on."  Brooke answered in a whisper.  "And by the way, don't
think this is an opportunity to sneak off to the bathroom and get
changed.  I'm seeing those panties tonight."</p>

<p>Sam got back into her shirt and took a deep breath before opening the
door to find her mother and Harrison staring back at her.  Her mother
was wearing a curious expression, which was never good.</p>

<p>"Why was the door locked?"</p>

<p>"The door?  Locked?  I…uh…force of habit I guess.  I was just showing
something to Brooke and I must have locked it by mistake.  Come on in
Harrison."</p>

<p>Harrison walked by Sam and took a seat on the bed.  Jane just shook
her head and went back downstairs to see the rest of the movie.
Harrison shifted uncomfortably on the bed.  He reached under himself
and brought out Sam's elusive bra, the wire had been sticking into
him.  </p>

<p>"Well, I guess I don't have to ask what it was you were showing
Brooke, huh Sammy?"</p>

<p>Both girls looked at the floor, their faces burning.</p>

<p>"Do…uh…should I leave the two of you alone?" Brooke asked, to break
the silence more than anything else.</p>

<p>"No."  Sam and Harrison both answered at once.</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk to you both."</p>

<p>"Look Harrison, this isn't the best time…" Sam began.</p>

<p>"I realise that now…this'll only take a minute, then I'll leave you
to get on with…whatever you were getting on with before I came."
Harrison sighed.  "Look Sam, I'm not some bigoted idiot.  I don't
think this is wrong or anything…I'm just a bit PO'd that you let me
go on about Brooke for like, my whole life and you never once
mentioned that you were interested in her…I thought we were supposed
to be friends?  Don't friends share stuff like that?"</p>

<p>"Harrison I'm sorry if you think that I've been keeping stuff from
you…it took so much for me just to admit to myself that I was
interested in Brooke, never mind saying it out loud to other people.
Plus I never thought that anything would come of it so I didn't see
much point in telling anyone.  How was I to know that Brooke was
lusting after me this whole time?"</p>

<p>"I'm not mad at you Sam, I just wanted to get that off my chest…who
am I going to talk to about Brooke now?  I can't exactly talk about
her rack to you anymore can I?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you want me to clobber you." Sam said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Uh…hello…Brooke happens to still be in the room here!"  Brooke
turned to Sam. "You used to discuss my `rack' with him?"</p>

<p>"It was never a discussion, I just used to listen to him raving about
you."</p>

<p>"Anyway, I'm…glad that the two of you got together…I mean…not glad
exactly…but what would be the point of three of us being alone and
miserable?  It's best that it's just me."  </p>

<p>He said it jokingly but there was a hint of truth in his statement.
Sam approached him and gave him a warm hug.  He held her tight to
reassure her things between them were OK.  When they separated he
turned to Brooke with open arms until he was grabbed by the ear and
escorted out of the room.</p>

<p>"You think I'm gonna stand and watch while you cop a quick feel?" Sam
joked.  "I'll see you later Harrison."  He nodded.  She closed the
door.</p>

<p>"Yeah, later."  With a heavy heart, Harrison headed down the stairs.</p>

<p>In Sam's bedroom there was an air of relief.  Sam went to Brooke and
hugged her.  Brooke was happy that Sam's friend had accepted her
choice…but there were more pressing matters at hand.</p>

<p>"So…about these panties."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Sam grinned into Brooke's neck upon hearing the casual enquiry about
her underwear.  She pulled away from Brooke slightly and looked her
in the eye.</p>

<p>"You really wanna see them huh?"</p>

<p>"Well…you've got me intrigued now…I probably wouldn't have even
noticed them if you hadn't drawn my attention to them…I'd have been
too busy trying to get them off you."  Brooke smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>Sam pretended to sigh in resignation.  She stepped out of Brooke's
arms and gestured towards her pants.</p>

<p>"OK, let's get this over with."</p>

<p>"I hope you're talking about the undressing part and not the whole
night."  Brooke teased.</p>

<p>"Well, If you're going to be this annoying all night…OK OK, I'm
sorry, I'm kidding." Sam said hurriedly as Brooke advanced on her, a
very menacing look on her face.  </p>

<p>Brooke stopped inches from Sam and kissed her softly before kneeling
down in front of her.  She slowly undid the top button on Sam's
jeans.  Then, ever so slowly she pulled down the zipper.  Her lack of
haste was designed to add to Sam's annoyance.  Brooke knew this had
succeeded when she received a slap upside her head.</p>

<p>"Hurry up for God's sake, you think I don't want to see your panties
tonight too?"</p>

<p>"I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying." said Brooke, looking up at Sam and
sticking her tongue out.  She kept her eyes locked on Sam's as her
hands found the waistband of her jeans.  With one smooth tug the
jeans were around Sam's ankles.  Brooke lowered her eyes to Sam's
crotch area.  Sam rolled her eyes to the heavens as she watched
Brooke cover her mouth with her hand to stifle the giggle.</p>

<p>"Look, my mom bought me these.  She said they summed up my
personality well, OK?  I didn't choose them."</p>

<p>Brooke looked up, highly amused.</p>

<p>"Oscar the Grouch?" she asked, still covering her mouth.  "Oscar the
Grouch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, OK, are you done?"</p>

<p>"Oh my God!"  </p>

<p>Brooke collapsed in a heap on the floor.  Sam stood and watched her
laugh until she cried, a very unimpressed expression gracing her
features.  She poked Brooke in the ribs with her toe.</p>

<p>"Uh…are you getting back up any time soon?  Cause I can watch ER if
there's nothing else to entertain me here."</p>

<p>"I'm up, I'm up."  Brooke reached up a hand and was pulled to her
feet.  She dried her eyes and pulled Sam into a hug.</p>

<p>"They're so cute…I could just stare at you all night in those."  </p>

<p>"I plan on doing more than staring."</p>

<p>"Well, so do I…I was just making the point that you are incredibly
sexy in your little Sesame Street panties."  She was in danger of
laughing again but quelled it successfully.  "And your mom is right…
they do suit your personality."
"And what's that supposed to mean?  You think I'm a grouch?"</p>

<p>"Well, let's review, up until very very recently the only time you
ever spoke to me was to yell or attack me or insult my friends…I'd
say that you're not exactly a little ray of sunshine are you?"</p>

<p>"So I'm what?  A rain-cloud?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I still love you.  You're my little rain-cloud."</p>

<p>Sam had been all ready to get steamed up about this comment but she
felt the anger fade away as she looked into Brooke's teasing eyes.
She slipped her arms around Brooke's waist.</p>

<p>"OK…but just don't call me that at school, it might harm my rep as a
serious journalist."</p>

<p>"You got it."  </p>

<p>They kissed.  Their smiles faded as the kiss increased in intensity.
Simultaneously they reached up to remove the unwelcome outer garments
they had put back on when they were so rudely interrupted.  Once they
were topless they parted in order to look at each other.  Sam's eyes
drank in the sight of Brooke's pert breasts and the smooth expanse of
her stomach.  She reached out and gently ran her hands down Brooke's
bare sides, eliciting a shiver of excitement from the cheerleader.
Her hands stopped at the top of Brooke's pants.</p>

<p>"These have to go."  Sam whispered, already unfastening them and
sliding them over Brooke's narrow hips.</p>

<p>Brooke was not wearing character panties much to Sam's chagrin.  She
was wearing deep blue silk panties that were almost as smooth to the
touch as Brooke's skin, Sam noted as she ran her hands over Brooke's
rear.  Sam straightened up but kept her hands on Brooke's buttocks,
squeezing the firm cheeks slightly as Brooke started kissing her
collar bone.  They explored one another's bodies with hands and
mouths, thrilling in the reactions that they were causing with their
caresses.</p>

<p>Without verbalising it, both realised the need to move to the bed.
They did this still tangled in a heated embrace.  When the backs of
Brooke's legs bumped into the edge of the bed they had no choice but
to fall into it.  Sam took advantage of her position on top by
straddling Brooke's thighs.  She pulled at the panties Brooke was
still wearing.  Brooke lifted her hips slightly and allowed Sam to
remove them.  Once they were discarded Sam turned her attention back
to Brooke.  Damn, she had been wrong.  Brooke was a natural blonde.
She was brought back from this thought by Brooke's teeth lightly
nibbling on her finger.  Sam adjusted her position so that she was
lying down with Brooke.  Brooke had finished sucking on her finger.
Sam took the moist digit and drew a trail down from Brooke's neck,
through the valley of her breasts, over her stomach until she reached
her destination.</p>

<p>When Sam entered her Brooke's world became very focussed.  There was
only one thing in it that made any sense: Sam McPherson.  Brooke
arched into Sam's hand, trying to deepen the connection that was
already overwhelming her senses.  Sam watched Brooke's face and saw
the myriad of emotions coursing through her own body mirrored on
Brooke's fine features.  They easily fell into a rhythm and Brooke
knew she couldn't hold on for much longer.  A warmth emanated from
the core of her desire.  As it grew hotter she pulled Sam close and
held on to her for all she was worth.  Then she felt herself
falling.  An explosion had gone off somewhere that she couldn't quite
pinpoint and she was feeling the effects of it all over her body.  </p>

<p>Sam watched in awe as Brooke's breath hitched in her throat and her
body became rigid for a second before a guttural moan was issued from
her mouth.  Her body arched into Sam's one last time before she fell
back onto the bed, pulling Sam on top of her.  Sam could feel Brooke
quivering and she gathered her in her arms and held her tight,
stroking her back and whispering in her ear.</p>

<p>"Shhhh, I've got you, shhhh." </p>

<p>They remained that way until Brooke regained the ability to speak.
She looked into Sam's eyes, still taken aback by the emotions she
found there even though she was feeling all of them herself.  </p>

<p>"You're amazing." she whispered, reaching out to trace Sam's lips
with her finger.</p>

<p>Sam let out a relieved breath when she heard these words.  No matter
how much it had seemed like Brooke was enjoying herself, Sam couldn't
quite shake the feeling that she was blatantly inexperienced in these
matters.  But Brooke's hushed praise was spoken with such feeling and
truth that she relaxed significantly, tension oozing out of her
body.  She smiled at Brooke.</p>

<p>"I aim to please."</p>

<p>"Mmmm, well you're a damn good aim," said Brooke huskily.  She
suddenly became sombre.  "I'm serious Sam…I have never felt so…so…God
I can't even describe it…I don't want to go all Jerry Maguire or
anything…but I feel like you make me whole."</p>

<p>Sam's eyes were brimming with tears and her throat was
constricted.  "I know."  She managed to croak out before the tears
became too difficult to fight and she gave in to them, sobbing into
Brooke's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hey, that wasn't supposed to make you cry…shhhh." said Brooke,
slightly panicked that she'd upset Sam.</p>

<p>Sam brought her head up and Brooke dried her tears and kissed their
salty residue from her cheeks.  Sam got her sobs under control and
rubbed her face before attempting to speak.</p>

<p>"I…it's weird.  Nobody's ever said stuff like that to me before…I
never thought I'd be the sappy kind who cries at these things.  But
when you said it…I don't know, it was like you looked right into my
heart and read what was written on it…I just wasn't prepared for the
way it made me feel."  She laid her head on Brooke's chest.  "And
you're much better looking than Tom Cruise anyway." she added as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>Brooke laughed and kissed the top of Sam's head.  They lay in a
comfortable silence for a while, Brooke running her fingers through
Sam's hair while Sam drew circles on Brooke's abs.  Brooke finally
decided that she needed to return Sam's earlier favour.</p>

<p>"OK McPherson, I've been dying to get you out of those panties all
night…I think it's about time you let me."</p>

<p>Sam looked up and grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, how could I refuse such a romantic suggestion."</p>

<p>Brooke rolled over so that she was lying on top of Sam.  Sam brought
her arms up around Brooke's torso, holding her in place.  Brooke
leaned down and captured Sam's lips in a slow, tender kiss.  She
spent time kissing and caressing the whole of Sam's upper body before
arriving at the now infamous panties.  Looking up she caught Sam's
gaze and held it as she took the material into her mouth and removed
the panties with her teeth, pulling them all the way down and over
Sam's feet which she dropped a quick kiss on before reclaiming her
place between Sam's thighs.  </p>

<p>Sam's heart was thundering in her chest as she watched Brooke's head
disappear between her legs.  At the first touch of Brooke's tongue
Sam sucked in a shuddering breath.  She reached down and gently held
the back of Brooke's head.  Brooke braced herself by gripping Sam's
thighs and continued with her exploration of Sam's most intimate
area.  Sam's breathing was ragged and her eyes were squeezed tightly
shut as she tried desperately to remember every sensation that Brooke
was sending through her.  She never wanted to forget how it felt the
first time.  But her brain wasn't exactly functioning properly and
she gave herself up to the pleasure.  She felt the tension building
and building until she was sure she was going to die…surely no one
person could feel this good without some kind of punishment.  She
waited, expecting to greet death any second.  The Grim Reaper didn't
come…but Sam did, she came hard.  Her hips rose up off the bed and
she removed her hands from Brooke's head as she grabbed the headboard
behind her.  She was aware of saying something but she didn't know
what it was…the next thing she knew Brooke was up beside her, kissing
her deeply.  She tasted herself in Brooke's mouth, she tasted sweet.
When their lips parted Sam allowed herself to be pulled into Brooke's
body where she tried hard to get her heart rate back under control.  </p>

<p>When she eventually came down from her euphoric state she looked up
to see Brooke staring at her, affection evident on her face.  Sam
smiled warmly.</p>

<p>"So…I finally see what all the fuss was about."</p>

<p>"Did it live up to the hype?" Brooke asked.</p>

<p>"Oh God, there's no way that any words could possibly do justice to
what we just experienced…it surpassed any expectations I might have
had."</p>

<p>Brooke's smile told Sam that she too had been nervous about her
performance.  Sam walked her fingers up Brooke's side playfully.</p>

<p>"You know what I'm thinking?" she asked, conversationally.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That I'm living every boy's dream right here.  I'm lying in bed,
naked, in post-coital bliss with a gorgeous, blonde-haired, blue-eyed
cheerleader."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"You know whose dream I'm living?"</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>"Mine."  Brooke looked at Sam in all seriousness.  "You're my dream
Sam."</p>

<p>Sam felt her eyes welling up again.  She thought she'd better say
something before she started blubbering like an idiot again.</p>

<p>"And you're my dream come true…I love you Brooke."</p>

<p>"I love you Sam."</p>

<p>Their lips met in a sweet kiss.  Both girls poured all of their
feelings and emotions into that gesture, conveying more than words
ever could.  They knew that their relationship wasn't the most
convenient or straightforward one in the world.  They were also aware
that there were a couple of major hurdles still left to face – and
their names were Mike and Jane.  But none of that mattered at that
moment.  They were together, they were happy, that was enough.  The
rest of the night was spent in total contentment, living out dreams
and fantasies until exhaustion forced the young lovers to drift into
dreamland which somehow now seemed to pale in comparison to real
life.  They slept in each other's arms, smiles on their faces, love
in their hearts.  And Oscar the Grouch panties dangling from the
headboard.</p>
