<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 14 -->

<P>A rhythmic thudding greeted Harry Kim as the door opened. Tom Paris laid flat on his back in his quarters throwing a ball against the wall and catching it over and over. "I would think you would be studying?" Paris laughed gruffly. "I've gotten enough of that already. I wasn't out of sickbay five minutes before Tuvok was shoving PADD's under my nose. Even the Doc seemed to be reading his Federation protocols rather loudly." Harry shook his head and sat in the chair at Tom's workstation. "They're just trying to help you help yourself." Paris threw the ball harder. "Remind me to thank them later." Harry stood up abruptly and moved to stand in Tom's line of sight.</P>
<P>"Damn it Tom! You got yourself in this hole and they are trying to give you the tools to dig yourself out! Quit feeling sorry for yourself, shut up and buckle down!" Paris arched his eyebrows. "Wow Harry, wish I felt as much about this as you do." "Stop it! Don't act like you don't care. You've turned yourself around more then once. Now it's just a matter of stopping going in circles. So are you going to the party?" Paris laughed again. "I don't think so, The minute I stepped through those doors the crew would string me up and use me as a pi&ntilde;ata. Still. have fun Harry. Have a drink for me." Harry nodded and got up to leave. As the doors closed he heard the thumping stop and silence ensue.</P>

<P>"The replicator logs have been erased." While many could have called Seven's tone neutral the EMH could hear the underlying disappointment. The two were meeting in the Doctor's office just off of sickbay and he leaned forward in his chair. "It's all right Seven. While we may not have any answers this does tell us we are on the right track." Seven arched her brow. "Clarify." The Doctor smiled. "If they had nothing to hide there would be no reason to erase the log, and unless they are replicating books of Federation law they are preparing from something else." Seven tilted her head. "Do you believe the Commander lied?" The EMH continued to smile. "No, no I'm sure he has spoken to B'Elanna about their Maquis status, but that doesn't mean that is ALL they talked about."</P>
<P>A worried expression crossed Seven's features, but the Doctor responded to it immediately. "I think we can safely say it is not a problem. While I wouldn't put it past B'Elanna to try to shield you the reactions of the crew seem all wrong. You said Neelix was resolute, Janeway was amused and Chakotay was nervous. All the while B'Elanna attempted to distract you?" Seven's normally calm expression had returned. "Correct." "I would say Neelix knows the secret and is determined to keep you from finding out, Chakotay is nervous about you finding out, and Captain Janeway knows, but does not play a direct part so she simply observes the confusion."</P>
<P>She mulled over his words then raised and lowered her brows. "There is also the fact Neelix attempted to defer me to B'Elanna." The Doctor nodded. "I think it is safe to assume it involves B'Elanna and yourself." He smirked. "I don't think she's pregnant. but she may be looking for more commitment." Seven seemed confused. "I am devoted to B'Elanna." The Doctor smiled. "Yes, but humans like grand gestures to demonstrate it." Seven's voice was very soft. "Like when Tom Paris proposed to B'Elanna." The Doctor put a hand on her shoulder. "Not exactly. His gesture was staking a claim to B'Elanna. He assumed her response was a forgone conclusion. Marriage is supposed to be laying your heart bare and HOPING they accept it."</P>
<P>The smoothes tones of Seven's voice were dry. "That would be messy, and fatal." The Doctor gave Seven an exasperated expression. "Funny. It seems a little early for marriage, but I could see her asking you to move in with her." Seven's confusion seemed genuinely confused as she spoke. "I would still need to regenerate." The Doctor smiled. "We'll work on that." She smiled in turn, even though she seemed uncomfortable doing so. "There is still the matter of the replicated item." The Doctor shook his head. "Probably just some gift to go with the occasion." Seven didn't seem convinced, but the Doctor misinterpreted her uncertain expression.</P>
<P>"Don't worry Seven, you already have places to store personal possessions in the alcoves. We can just find a special place to set aside for gifts from B'Elanna. Unless of course you get a whole new place to start storing things." The last part was said with a smirk, but when the confused look on Seven's face remained the Doctor grew concerned. "You don't have to worry Seven. I'll help you pick out any gift you want to get for B'Elanna. By the time we're finished her head will be spinning." At her stare her rolled his eyes. "Not literally, we will be amazed by the romance you'll be showing her." "That is not my concern. I wonder if B'Elanna is uncertain of the idea of further commitment."</P>
<P>At that point the Doctor leaned forward enough to rest his weight against the desk. "Don't be Seven. Look at how long she put up with Paris, and he treated her horrendously. You ADORE her and she loves you more then she ever did him. If she is waiting, it is only for the perfect time." Seven arched her brow. "As you said she and I love each other. What time would be better then the present? The Doctor shrugged, over dinner, during shore leave. at the party!" The seemed to move back from the exclamation but the Doctor made a calming motion with his hand. "No, it's perfect. The party celebrating the engine the two of you made. It couldn't be more perfect."</P>
<P>Seven looked skeptical. "Perfect? Melodrama is irrelevant." The Doctor laughed. "Far from it. Those special points in our lives will be in our memories forever, and it only makes sense to make them as special as possible." The skeptical expression stayed in place. "You are a hologram, your memories of every event will remain unchanged unless you suffer damage to your program." The hologram shuffled uncomfortably in his seat as she continued. "My cortical implant performs a similar function." The Doctor grimaced. "Remind me to give you a lesson in sentiment, but remember Seven. You are not the only one involved here. The fact she is going to such trouble to make it special for you is a sign of just how much she cares."</P>
<P>Blue eyes opened wide. "I understand." The Doctor smiled fondly. "Exactly, just be sure to act surprised." Seven tilted her head. "Since I do not know the nature of B'Elanna's surprise I will be surprised. I just know that it is not an unpleasant one." The Doctor smiled. "No, it seems highly unlikely." Seven seemed to pout. "I still wish to know the nature of the surprise." The Doctor smiled once more. "That is that nature of surprises."</P>
