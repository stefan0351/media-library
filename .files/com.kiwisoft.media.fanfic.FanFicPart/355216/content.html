<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Free Fall -->

<p>The entire incident at Terri's had been a screaming shouting fest. Despite the police presence, none of the girls were cooperative. First Nicole and her mother had gotten into a rout worthy of any WWF wrestler when Gayle had informed Nicole that she was enrolled in a private boarding school overseas. Apparently Gayle felt that the more miles she put between Nicole and Lily the better. The police had to pry Nicole off of her mother. Nicole then grabbed on to Lily and refused to set foot outside the house. She was not leaving Lily without a fight. Of course, then Maria had to get involved and she and Lily got into a shouting match. Nicole and Lily were eventually placed in seperate cars under guard when they refused to leave quietly.</p>
<p>All the shouting brought Brooke out from the room she shared with the still groggy Sam. She knew what was going on but ventured out to see for herself. Mike and Terri were having a face off over her and Sam while Jane was speaking to a few of the officers. Brooke hoped that she was telling them how Mike had assaulted Sam. Upon seeing her, Mike immediately turned his attention from Terri to Brooke.</p>
<p>"Get your stuff and get in the car, Brooke," he ordered. Brooke scowled at him.</p>
<p>"Not in this lifetime," she scoffed at him. She looked at Jane and the cops. "Did you tell them what he did to Sam?" Jane nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, honey, but..."</p>
<p>"But WHAT?" Brooke shouted. "There are three witnesses that saw him beat on a 17 year old girl! Why aren't you taking him away?" she demanded to know from the closest officer.</p>
<p>"It was on private property and Mrs. McPherson isn't pressing charges," the officer told her calmly. Brooke turned bright red with anger.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" she seethed. Jane looked away unable to keep Brooke's angry gaze.</p>
<p>"Brooke, if I press charges on that, he'll claim Sam kidnapped you and that this whole thing is her fault. She could get into a lot of trouble, Brooke," Jane explained quietly. Brooke turned to her father.</p>
<p>"You asshole!" she shouted. "I left of my own free will. So did Nicole and Lily. Sam didn't kidnap anyone. We left because you, our PARENTS made us. We weren't left a choice so we took the only option available to us. You're just looking for someone to blame. I got news for you, MIKE," she spat his name in a mocking tone. "The only person here that should be blamed is YOU. Not Sam, but you, Mike McQueen, homophobe extrordinaire."</p>
<p>"Don't you speak to me that way, young lady," Mike warned lowly.</p>
<p>"Or what? You'll hit me too? I dare you because guess what? I WILL press charges against you," Brooke informed him firmly. Mike walked up so that he was face to face with his daughter.</p>
<p>"Now you listen to me, little girl, and you listen good. Don't threaten me, I am STILL your father whether you like it or not. You get your stuff and get in the car because we are going home. When we get there, you are to have NO contact whatsoever with Sam. You are not to speak to her or of her. You are not to be in the same building she's in at anytime. As far as your life is concerned, Samantha McPherson does not exist," he spoke in a deadly calm voice that actually scared Brooke on some level although she wasn't going to let it show.</p>
<p>"That's going to be awfully hard since a) I love her; b) we live in the same house; and c) go to the same school. Oh and did I mention I LOVE HER?" Brooke shouted at her father.</p>
<p>"You will NEVER speak that way to me again!" Mike bellowed. "You know nothing about love and this...'thing' between you two is not love, it's sick! Sam is no longer welcome in my home. Where she lives is no concern of mine. Jane is still welcome at the Palace, as is my other daughter Mac, but Sam is NOT. And I'll transfer you to another school if I have to."</p>
<p>"Mike," Jane broke in. "Mac and I will never be living under the same roof as you. You DARED raise a hand in anger to my daughter. How could you even THINK that I'd still marry you, let alone let you raise Mac in an atmosphere like that?" she sneered. Mike sputtered at her.</p>
<p>"You can't take Mackenzie away from me!" he declared. Jane's eyes narrowed and she smirked a very Sam-like devilish smirk.</p>
<p>"Watch me," she challenged. Just then Sam emerged unsteadily in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Brooke? Mom? What's going on?" she asked confused. Brooke walked over and gathered Sam into her arms.</p>
<p>"It's falling apart, Sammy," she whispered in Sam's ear. "They've taken Nicole and Lily away and now Dad is trying to take me." Tears welled up in Sam's eyes.</p>
<p>"No," she whimpered clinging tightly to Brooke. "I won't let him." Mike rushed over and abruptly forced the girls apart.</p>
<p>"Stay away from my daughter!" he screamed as Sam stumbled a few feet away.</p>
<p>"Mr. McQueen," an officer warned stepping closer to intervene so that Mike couldn't go after Sam again. Mike managed to look contrite.</p>
<p>"You can't do this, Mike," Sam argued softly, still tired and weak from her last altercation with him.</p>
<p>"Yes, I can, Sam. She is still my daughter and I know what's best for her."</p>
<p>"How can you know what's in her heart?" Sam asked, still calm. "You haven't taken the time to talk to her. How can you know how she feels and therefore what's best for her if you won't take the time to get to know her?"</p>
<p>"You have already ruined my engagement to your mother, Samantha. I will not let you further corrupt my daughter!" He turned to Brooke. "Get your things we are leaving now!"</p>
<p>There was nothing more Sam or Brooke could do to stop the inevitable. Crying heavily Brooke packed up her things and had a heart wrenching goodbye with Sam while Terri and Jane kept Mike occupied.</p>
<p>"This doesn't change how I feel for you. You know that, right, Sam? He can't make me stop loving you," Brooke stroked the side of Sam's bruised face lovingly, wiping the tears as they fell down the brunettes cheeks.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry. This is all my fault," Sam cried.</p>
<p>"Aww, Sammy, why?" Brooke wondered.</p>
<p>"You're relationship with your Dad is destroyed, Mom lost her fiancee, Mac lost her dad, Nic and Lily's family's are in shambles all cuz I couldn't keep my feelings to myself. I ruined five lives," Sam explained through her tears. Brooke sighed. There was Sam, taking responsibility for all that went wrong around her.</p>
<p>"You ruined nothing, Sam," she said softly but firmly, making Sam look her in the eye. "You have made everything better. I've never felt more alive, more loved than I do when I'm in your arms. Mike isn't going to change that. We'll find a way around him to be together, I promise." Sam sniffled.</p>
<p>"Promise?"</p>
<p>"With all my heart and soul, Sammy. I love you too much to let go of you now," Brooke leaned in and kissed her soundly and deeply feeling Sam melt against her.</p>
<p>"I love you, I need you, Brooke," Sam responded. Brooke held her tight.</p>
<p>"I know, Sammy. I know."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Jane watched as Sam sat curled up on the bed in the motel room they were staying in, watching the raging thunderstorm outside the window. The teen had barely spoken two words to anyone since they'd returned from Texas a week earlier and Jane was beginning to worry. Sam wasn't eating, wasn't sleeping and her wounds from Mike were healing slower than they should have. It was like she simply stopped the second Brooke was lead away from her into the waiting car. When the car had driven out of sight, Sam had collapsed and ended up overnight in the hospital for exhaustion and trauma. Now that she was home, she was doing no better.</p>
<p>Nicole was in Europe at a boarding school; Lily still went to Kennedy but her mother dropped her off in the morning and picked her up right after the bell rang. She wasn't allowed to talk to anyone outside of school and was forced to stay away from Brooke. Brooke was still at Kennedy trying to clean up the mess Mary Cherry had created in her and Nicole's absence and Sam was being home schooled. Aside from Brooke and Lily occasionally speaking during school hours, the foursome no longer had contact with each other.</p>
<p>Terri had returned to L.A. with Jane and Sam and helped them move their stuff from the Palace to the motel. She was staying in the next room trying to offer emotional and moral support to Sam and Jane as well as Brooke. She was the only one who could see Brooke and Sam and therefore communicate between the two. But Jane could see that the notes and little messages were not enough for her oldest daughter. Sam was slowly dying inside and Jane could see it.</p>
<p>But there was nothing she could think to do to help. Mike had gone so far as to get restraining orders. Even she could no longer go near the Palace or Brooke. The whole thing was way out of control.</p>
<p>"Sam, honey, you have to eat," she spoke gently to the form huddled on the bed in the dark.</p>
<p>"Not hungry," Sam mumbled without uncurling from the ball she was hunched in. Jane sighed.</p>
<p>"Getting sick won't help things," she pointed out. She heard Sam sigh heavily.</p>
<p>"Whatever. Nothing I do will help things. Might as well fade away."</p>
<p>"SAMANTHA JOSEPHINE MCPHERSON!" Jane scolded. "Don't talk like that. Brooke wouldn't want to hear that and neither do I." Sam finally tore her gaze away from the storm and looked at her mother. The lost and hopeless look in Sam's deep brown eyes scared her mother. She hadn't seen such a look of desperate agony on her daughter's face since Joe had died. She moved to sit with Sam on the bed and enveloped her in a loving hug.</p>
<p>"Oh honey, we'll find a way to fix this, I promise," she told Sam, praying that she wasn't lying to her. She really did want to find a way to bring Sam and Brooke back together but couldn't see how to get past Mike.</p>
<p>"I'm tired of empty promises, Mom," Sam confessed. "I'm just tired of everything. The fighting, the running. Why does it have to be so hard?" She pulled away from her mother and curled up under the covers.</p>
<p>"I wish I knew, Sammy. But try to have faith that things will work out," she advised. Sam said nothing but closed her eyes and drifted off.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam was upset. Brooke could feel it across town as she watched the rain lash against her windows. She didn't know why but it was almost like the weather was reflecting how Sam felt and was letting Brooke know. Not that Brooke needed anyone to tell her. She felt the same way. She was literally locked in the house with nothing but her feelings and anger festering inside of her. Mike had laid down the rules when they had returned home, letting Brooke know on no uncertain terms that Sam was off limits. If she broke that rule, she'd be sent to live with her grandparents in Michigan and that was WAY too far from Sam for Brooke to bear.</p>
<p>Returning to school had been horrible. The rumors and innuendo about the four of them was rabid and there was no escaping it. So Brooke chose not to address it. Lily had followed her example. Without Sam or Nicole there, neither girl felt it was their place to 'out' them without consent. So they let the rumors fly and did their best to ignore them. Getting Mary Cherry off the 'throne' was a chore. The hick had nearly super glued herself to it and was fanatic about retaining her status. But it was clear the second Brooke returned that the Southerner was simply an interim 'queen' and she was quickly returned to her place by the masses. She wasn't terribly happy about the situation but there wasn't much she could do.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy," Brooke sighed as she looked out the window and a flash of lightening lit up the sky. "I miss you."</p>
<p>And she did. She missed Sam's very presence. In a way, Brooke couldn't believe how much she'd come to rely on just Sam being there; hearing her breathe, inhaling her scent. The subtle things she never gave much notice to until they weren't there anymore. Sam was her comfort, her safety and her very own father had taken that away from her.</p>
<p>Brooke was insanely angry with her father. She never thought herself capable of hating anyone but the moment he had hit Sam, she learned to hate him. She was still having trouble sleeping because that image continued to play in her minds eye. And here she was stuck in the same house with him. What angered her more was the fact that Mike now acted like Sam never existed. He spoke to Brooke like the past few months never happened and his engagement to Jane was simply a bad mistake. Although he had expressed to Brooke that he was pretty sure Jane would come back soon. She had laughed at that. She knew there was no way Jane was ever coming back to him and as much as she missed Jane and loved her, Brooke was glad for that.</p>
<p>Sitting down at her computer, she reached out to Sam the only way she had left, e-mail. Sam was only able to check her mail on her laptop periodically but Brooke made sure there was always a letter or two from her for Sam to read. She smiled as she saw that Sam had written her back.</p>

<p><i>God, I miss you so much. I love you. I feel like I'm dying without you, Brooke. I know that sounds melodramatic but it's true. I can't eat or sleep or function without you here with me. I loved you for so long and then to have you love me back, have all that blissful wonderful time together, and then lose you because of Mike...it's destroying me, Brooke. I don't know what to do with myself. Neither does Mom or Terri. They try but, I don't know...I need YOU, Brooke. I'm not strong enough for this. We have to find a way out of this mess before there's nothing left. I hope you're OK. </i></p>
<p><i>Please remember how much I love you. </i></p>
<p><i>Love, </i></p>
<p><i>Sammy </i></p>
<br>
<p>Brooke frowned. She was happy to hear from Sam but upset to 'hear' how bad Sam was feeling. But it confirmed her suspicions about her feelings and the storm.</p>

<p><i>I miss you too and love you so much that there's nothing else I can think of. But Sammy, you have to hold on. For me. I know how you feel, I feel the same way and hate that my father has done this to us. But we will be together again. He will NOT keep me from you forever. He can't. Stay with Mom and Terri, listen to them, they're trying to help. Remember that I love you and hold on to that as tight as you can when you feel your worst. It will never change, it will never waver. Time won't change it and neither will my father's ignorance. </i></p>
<p><i>I'm so sorry I wasted so much time ignoring my feelings for you. If I had just been honest all along, with you and myself, we could have had so much more time together so far. But you can't spend your time wishing about what might have been. Focus on the now, Sammy, and know that I'm with you. Always. </i></p>
<p><i>Love, </i></p>
<p><i>Brooke </i></p>

<p>Nicole always wanted to see Switzerland. Only, this was not how she wanted to do it. Locked up in a boarding school that could double for a convent, she was not a happy camper. And she was horribly worried about Lily. She was concerned about Brooke and Sam too but moreso for Lily. She knew that Maria was not going to be treating Lily well and hoped that things didn't degrade too far. It was bad enough her own mother had given her a hell of a whumping on the private flight overseas but the mere thought of Lily being hurt by Maria turned Nic's stomach.</p>
<p>She wondered how Sam was doing. That girl was more fragile than the rest of them and she really hoped Brooke knew that. What had started as a simple confession to a friend had spiraled into a full-blown relationship with the girl of her dreams and then fallen into an abusive situation with that girl's father, Sam's own 'stepfather'. The poor girl was bound to snap eventually and Nic was worried that there'd be no one there to help her.</p>
<p>(Bet you wish you had a parachute, huh Spam?) she thought to herself while lying on her bed in her room. (Cuz this free fall sucks)</p>
<p>Nicole was already working on a plan to 'leave' Sister Bridget's School for Girls. And she had enlisted the help of some of her more unsavory classmates. It was amazing what a little intimidation and money could do.</p>
<p>"Lil, I miss you," she whispered to the darkness before falling asleep.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily threw her bookbag at her bedroom door as it shut behind her mother. Using a few choice words in Spanish she let her mother know exactly what she thought of the situation. Maria, however, was unswayed. She had her daughter back and as long as she lived under her roof, there would be no more 'Nicole Julian' business. Lily had tried to explain that THAT was why she had left but the logic was for some reason lost on Maria Esposito.</p>
<p>"It's not fair!" Lily shouted, voicing what all four girls thought at some point. "It's my life, not yours!"</p>
<p>"You're too young to make such decisions, therefore I have to make the correct ones for you until you are," Maria yelled though the door. "Someday you'll thank me."</p>
<p>"HA!" Lily mocked. "When will I be old enough, Mama? When I'm FIFTY?"</p>
<p>"When you stop acting like a petulant child," Maria informed her.</p>
<p>"I'm not the one acting like a child, Mama, you are. I'm not what YOU want so you're trying to force me to change. THAT is childish!"</p>
<p>"We're through talking. When you can speak to me like a civilized person, then you can come out of your room," and with that, Maria walked away.</p>
<p>"And I will forever be stuck in my room," Lily muttered. She put her head in her hands and sighed. "Well, this is one HELL of a mess." And unfortunately, Lily saw no way of cleaning it right now.</p>
