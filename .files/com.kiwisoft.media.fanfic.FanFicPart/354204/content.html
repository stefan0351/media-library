<!-- Militat Omnis Amans \ Epilogue - Acta est fibula (the play is over) -->

<p>Touch my skin, and tell me what you're thinking
Take my hand, and show me where we're going
Lie down next to me,
look into my eyes,
and tell me -- oh tell me what you're seeing
Take my hand

<p>On a darkened world, many realities removed from the one which Buffy
and Willow just departed, a demon lord sat contemplating the news he
had just received.</p>

<p>"What happed," he asked a lieutenant, "how could things have got out
of hand so quickly?"</p>

<p>"I don't know my lord," replied the nervous aide, "but the effects have
been substantial.  We have lost access to that part of the network for
at least the next ten generations, and the power supply feeding our worlds,
has been diminished by at least fifteen percent."</p>

<p>"I know that fool," replied the lord as he began to pace, "what I don't
know, and you had better find out but quick, is how it happened, and,
who is responsible." </p>

<p>"Your will lord," replied the demon, as he left his masters presence.</p>

<p>Deep within the magical realm, which formed part of the void between
the various realities, the Goddess though to herself, "Things are going
well, but I've had it easy till now. The gods of Chaos will not sit still
for much longer as I try to undo their millennia of meddling.  Things
will start to move quickly now." </p>

<p>In the town of Morning Breeze the Sage Frankel, the slayer Sonya and
the guardsman Daithi were just finishing their early breakfast.</p>

<p>"What now," asked Sonya?</p>

<p>"Now we pack up everyone and head back to the capital, to see if we can
rebuild what the demon's have destroyed," replied Frankel.</p>

<p>"Then we head out and finish the rest of them off," added Daithi. </p>

<p>"I hope they arrived ok," said Sonya changing the subject.</p>

<p>"I'm sure they did," replied Frankel.</p>

<p>"I'm just thinking," continued the slayer, "that we haven't seen the
last of them." </p>

<p>In a cosy bedroom in the town of Sunnydale, four young women slept
intertwined
together on a large comfortable bed.  They had been so tired after their
arrival, and after answering countless questions from Buffy and Willow's
friends and family that as soon as they got to the room they had collapsed
without undressing. </p>

<p>One of the figures detached herself from the others and made her way
towards the window, where she stood, staring out at the 'modern' world.
She reached out a hand to her lover as she came up quietly beside her.
Holding hands they looked out at the world.</p>

<p>&lt;How Willow?  How did this happen?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I made a booboo, lover.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;But the whole year gone?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Well, not gone, exactly, just not experienced by anyone on this world,
that's all.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy turned from the window and enveloped her lover in a deep embrace,
&lt;could you believe the way everyone reacted?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I thought mom and dad would have kittens,&gt; agreed Willow, mentally smiling
at the memory.</p>

<p>&lt;And Giles, and the others.  I thought that they would never stop asking
questions.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;At least they let us send Amana and Grael to the hospital, without too
many questions, first.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I don't think they're done with in inquisition yet.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;No kidding,&gt; agreed Willow, &lt;just think, you haven't had to deal with
your mother yet.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Maybe this is all just a dream,&gt; said Buffy hopefully.</p>

<p>Just then the two women heard the whimpers and cries of two hungry, wet
daughters.</p>

<p>&lt;Guess not,&gt; said the arch-mage, "time to tend to the children."</p>

<p>Hand in hand the two lovers made their way into the rest of their lives.</p>
