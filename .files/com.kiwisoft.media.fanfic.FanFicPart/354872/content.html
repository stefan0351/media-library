<p>Personal log, Captain Kathryn Janeway star date 52736,2</p>

		<p>I am beginning to regret ordering Seven and B'Elanna to share quarters. It's apparently not working, I guess that from what little Seven was willing to share with me. It seems like they're only talking on a need to know basis. That was not what I had in mind when I came up with the idea of having them live together. And to add to the problem of my great idea not working I have to handle an extremely confused ex-Borg, now. And believe me when I say it, confused Borg are no good Borg.</p>

		<p>She had a dream last night. Her first real dream. She said it was similar to something like a dream she had while regenerating. She also said this 'dreaming' only began a week ago. Why hadn't she talked to me earlier about it?</p>

		<p>When I asked her to tell me what she could still remember from the dream, she did that . literally, she told me every little detail. In essence: she is holding a woman smaller than herself and she feels something, something she can't name. 'An unfamiliar emotion,' as she stated. She also told me that in the last dream she had kissed the other woman.</p>

		<p>My best guess is that the 'unfamiliar emotion' is love. Of course I didn't tell her that, she would be even more confused than she is now, if I did.</p>

		<p>I never would have thought Seven might be interested in women . I promised to help her, but I have no idea as to how to go about it, and with what she wants help. I think I will ask Chakotay for assistance, he knows more about dreams than I do.</p>

		<p>Did I mention my surprise when I saw the piano in B'Elanna's quarters? I'd have thought she would never agree with that kind of big change in her personal space .Perhaps she is adapting * chuckles*. But enough of Seven and B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>I don't know what to do about 'it'. You know what I am talking about. Would it even be possible for me to become involved with a crew member? Yes or no? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I have to think about the ship, how would my being involved with a crew member impact that? So many questions, so many answers. I don't want to ask them and I don't want to answer them. But there is only one question that really matters.</p>

		<p>IS HE FEELING THE SAME I AM FEELING?</p>
