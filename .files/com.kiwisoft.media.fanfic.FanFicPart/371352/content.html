<p><b>Sorry for the length, but this chapter is just to build up plot.</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I couldn't believe it. Really, I couldn't. I thought after my change, after my life was fucked up, that I would never experience an ounce of good luck. But it wasn't just luck I came across, no, it was much more. I found a friend, someone to look after me and a place where no one knew me or what I was. It was everything I thought I would never have, and yet here I was, in possession of something I thought was only plausible in a dream. I had the sweetest girl in the world as my best friend and even though I was different, she treated me normally.</p>
<p>There was, however, a down side. There always is. While I was content with my life, I knew I couldn't have the kind of friendship I wanted with Miley because I was careless and foolish with how I went about spending time with her. Even though it would be so much more difficult, I knew I had to swap everything around.</p>
<p>I travelled further along the familiar Stewart property and spotted Miley on Blue Jeans. I swear, she was on that horse like five times a day in between chores. She could never wipe the big grin off her face when she was atop the stallion and it was useless trying to resist feeling giddy myself when I saw her smile. I stopped at the fence that surrounded a large sector of land, restricting the roaming animals to the many archers of land within the fence. The Stewarts owned a lot of land and they lived quite far from civilisation, as miniscule as it was in this town. It took Miley a few minutes to notice me leaning against a fence post, but it seemed Blue Jeans decided for her that they were going to gallop towards me from across the field.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lilly! It's nice to see that you finally came around without me having to nearly beg," Miley said warmly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, you made an offer I just couldn't refuse."</p>
<p>"What? Dinner?"</p>
<p>"No. Spending time with you."</p>
<p>Miley ducked her head, her hair and hat shielding the blush I'd already seen. She always got extremely shy after I paid her any kind of compliment and I had to admit it was very cute, but the result cost me my breath. I heard her mutter a "thank you" and I smirked, reminding myself why I was here invading Miley's day.</p>
<p>"Well, I really just came over to tell you I enrolled at Crowley Corners High school. I was hoping maybe you'd show me around until I got my bearings." Embarrassment forgotten, Miley's head shot up, her eyes alight.</p>
<p>"Oh! Of course I will Lilly! It would be my pleasure. Are you a senior?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"I am too! I'd be glad to show you the ropes," Miley said pleasantly, dismounting Blue Jeans, permitting the horse to wander off. Miley rested her elbows on top of the wooden fence, her blue gaze on me, suddenly seeming to be at a high level of calm. "You wanna hang out for the day?"</p>
<p>"It's about time you asked," I replied, grabbing the fence with one hand, using it to support me as I swiftly jumped over it. I landed squarely next to Miley and smiled at her stunned expression.</p>
<p>"Are you an athlete or somethin'?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Just naturally talented?" Her lips arched, evidently impressed by my grace while airborne.</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Miley ~</p>
<p>While Lilly may be keeping a butt load of secrets from me, I had to admit she was very easy to be around. The silences we fell into were relaxing and I don't think I've met a girl as thoughtful and chaste as Lilly was. I seriously was looking forward to a possible friendship with her and the fact that she was going to be at my school for a whole year was a major bonus.</p>
<p>I introduced her to all the animals on the farm, but somehow, she seemed so familiar with them and when I said she must be an animal person, she laughed! I didn't know what she found so funny, but I joined in on the laughter regardless because the sound of her happiness brought forth a powerful joy that did my heart well.</p>
<p>When Lilly got tired of walking around, she threw herself into the grass and lay there sprawled out, staring at the sky in a daze. I joined her in the tall grass blades, watching the clouds silently. Quiet rustles stole my focus and I glanced down to see Lilly's hand inching towards mine, but she seemed to reconsider her actions and it retreated back to her side in defeat. I don't know why that made me smile so much and I don't know why I reached out and laced our fingers, but I knew it was the right choice once I heard the soft sigh Lilly emitted.</p>
<p>The clouds formed into strange shapes, blocking out the hot sun for long minutes at times. I mindlessly studied the white animal like formations, wondering if Princess knew to stay away while Lilly was here. But if she did come and Lilly saw her, would she tell anyone? Should I make her swear to secrecy at this very moment so it won't be too late?</p>
<p>"Lilly?" I ventured slowly.</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"Can you keep a secret?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. What is it?"</p>
<p>"You have to promise not to tell anyone."</p>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<p>"Well... Every night for the past week or so, this wolf has been sneakin' onto the farm and I've been feedin' it."</p>
<p>"Really? A wolf?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and it's not vicious or nothin', which I found really weird, but it's just so... <i>human</i>."</p>
<p>"That's a strange choice of words," Lilly remarked with a questionable undertone.</p>
<p>"But it's true! It's like she understands everythin' I say and she's real friendly. I think I want you to meet her."</p>
<p>"That would be great Miley and don't worry, I won't tell a soul," Lilly pledged. I couldn't even begin to explain how relieved I felt knowing she didn't think any less of me for allowing a wolf onto my property, let alone encouraging it to continue trespassing.</p>
