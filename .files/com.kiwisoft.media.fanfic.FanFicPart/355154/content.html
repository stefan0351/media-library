<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Four -->

<p>"I can't believe she knows and is OK with it," Sam said flabbergasted when they arrived at school that day. Brooke put her arm around Sam's shoulder and hugged her slightly.</p>
<p>"See? You were worried over that for nothing," she whispered in Sam's ear. Sam leaned into Brooke's warm embrace.</p>
<p>"I'm glad that I was wrong. But don't get used to it, it doesn't happen often," she joked. They were drawn out of their conversation by a commotion further up the hall. When they arrived at the source, they found Sam's locker virtually destroyed, her books and papers strewn about, torn and in shreds. Her books were ripped apart and there was nothing in her locker that was untouched. Written all over the surrounding area were hateful slurs directed at Sam and her sexuality, some of them downright evil.</p>
<p>"Jesus," Brooke breathed. Looking at the damage, it was obvious to see the rage involved in causing it.</p>
<p>"Aw man?" Sam whined. "My stuff." She went about trying to pick up her things and salvage something, anything that once was but it quickly became apparent that nothing was savable.</p>
<p>"Well, this SUCKS," Sam growled. The crowd had dissipated leaving Sam and Brooke with a startled Lily and Carmen.</p>
<p>"Wow, Sam, any idea what the heck happened?" Lily asked as she helped the other three pick up the mess.</p>
<p>"Yeah, one word for you. HAR-RI-SON," she drew out his name to emphasize her point.</p>
<p>"Sam, you don't really think Harrison could honestly be responsible for something like this?" Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"Something so?angry?" Lily added. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Trust me, right now I wouldn't put anything past our dear Mr. John," Sam said disgusted.</p>
<p>"Sammy, he did threaten you," Brooke said, a hint of worry and alarm creeping into her voice. Sam looked at her and gave her a reassuring smile.</p>
<p>"Harrison? Please. He's about as harmful or threatening as a newborn baby kitten," Sam scoffed.</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke started. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke, I am not going to let that jealous, narrow-minded, homophobic little wuss get to me. Or you. He can go shove his head in a blender for all I care," she declared, picking up the last of her books and papers. Carmen and Lily were staring at her curiously. She arched an eyebrow at them.</p>
<p>"What?" Sam snapped.</p>
<p>"Why would it matter to you if Harrison was homophobic?" Lily asked slowly. Sam felt her skin tingle as the words sunk in.</p>
<p>&lt;Shit&gt; she sighed silently. She looked at Brooke for help but the imploring look in the blonde's eyes didn't help her. Taking a deep breath, Sam decided it was time to fess up.</p>
<p>"Lily, Carmen?Brooke and I?I mean that is to say?we're?involved," she stuttered as the hallway tilted to the right and Brooke was suddenly there supporting her as she swayed.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy," Brooke whispered quietly in Sam's ear as she wrapped her arms around the slightly shorter brunette. Carmen's eyes got wide and Lily's jaw dropped open.</p>
<p>"You mean the crazy shit Harrison's been saying is the TRUTH?" Lily hissed surprised but trying to keep her voice down. She couldn't believe Harrison might actually have been right.</p>
<p>"Involved as in, `INVOLVED' involved?" Carmen asked blinking in confusion. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"As in romantically," she clarified. "And yes, the little prick was actually telling a somewhat skewered version of the truth."</p>
<p>"Holy?" Lily breathed.</p>
<p>"B?b?but?" Carmen stuttered in shock.</p>
<p>"Come on, Carmen, you can form words. You can do it," Brooke teased, slightly annoyed. Carmen glared at her.</p>
<p>"Well, Sam I can see as maybe being gay. But YOU Brooke? You MUST have hit your head harder than everyone thought," she finally managed to say.</p>
<p>"Carmen!" Lily scolded. Carmen shrugged.</p>
<p>"What? Lily, tell me that makes sense. She goes from dating Josh, to dating Harrison, has the accident and is suddenly batting switch? Something's not right there," she explained.</p>
<p>"I told you so," Sam sighed sadly to Brooke before turning to walk away. Lily looked at Brooke.</p>
<p>"She told you what?" she asked curiously. Brooke frowned and was torn between explaining things to Lily for Sam's sake (because honestly Brooke could care less what anyone thought) and going after an obviously upset Sam. But she knew she had to clear things up before she could comfort Sam and that Sam needed some time alone.</p>
<p>"She told me everyone would think that she took advantage of me after the accident. That the accident was responsible for what's between us. But Lily, I've read the old Brooke's diary. She loved Sam too, but couldn't?wouldn't admit it. The stupid accident just afforded me the opportunity to act on it. And Sam fought me on every level for a long time. This is new to us both, really," she told the still stunned Latina and a slightly less than friendly Carmen. Lily nodded.</p>
<p>"You know what, Brooke? I think I understand," Lily said with a small smile. Hey, as long as they were happy, who was she to interfere?</p>
<p>"Yeah? Well I don't," Carmen declared. "You mean to tell me that she DIDN'T play on your injury? Because, and don't get me wrong, I love Sam?" she paled for a second. "AS A FRIEND ONLY," she said firmly and needlessly. "But she sometimes can be a tad bit manipulative in order to get what she wants," she finished. Brooke scowled at her.</p>
<p>"I think you have her confused with Nicole," she said flippantly. "Look, we neither want or need your permission, Carmen. We're in love so, stick THAT up your ass and blow it out your ear," she barked at Carmen who jumped slightly. She then stalked off to find Sam. Lily crossed her arms over her chest, tilted her head, arched an eyebrow and looked at her stunned friend.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess she told YOU."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke found Sam out past the bleachers sitting in the grass quietly. She walked up and sat down next to the other girl.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said in greeting.</p>
<p>"Hey," Sam said back but then nothing more. Brooke nudged Sam's shoulder with her own.</p>
<p>"Lily's OK with us. And I think Carmen will be too once the shock wears off and she gets a twinkie in her system," she tried to joke but it fell flat.</p>
<p>"That's good," Sam said distantly. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" she asked softly, reaching out to run her fingers through Sam's mahogany hair. Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"I love you," she said in response. Brooke smiled.</p>
<p>"That's a good thing, Sammy. Especially because I love you too." Sam turned to look at Brooke and the blonde was slightly alarmed to see the lost look on Sam's face.</p>
<p>"I know but?it's never going to be easy, is it?" she asked. Brooke stroked the side of Sam's face with her fingertips.</p>
<p>"No, love, it's not," she admitted reluctantly. "There will always be someone who frowns upon us." Sam sighed again and was quiet for several minutes. Brooke was afraid that she was having second thoughts and wasn't sure if she could handle that.</p>
<p>"Well, that SUCKS," Sam finally declared, surprising Brooke. She looked at the blonde and smirked.</p>
<p>"I suppose, if I have you, I can muddle through somehow, right?" she asked. "Because you'll be there for me." Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, of course I will. Always. But please, try not to be so sappy. I think you're giving me cavities." Sam slapped her lightly on the shoulder and then pulled her down into a fiery kiss.</p>
<p>"I think it'd be worth it."</p>
