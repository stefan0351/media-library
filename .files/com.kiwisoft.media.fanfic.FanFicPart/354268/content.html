<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 23: Announcements -->

<P>The reception was in full swing, all of the crewmembers not on duty attended,
and seemed to be having a good time. It wasn’t so much because of the marriage
being celebrated, it was more the fact that the crew loved to party, and that
they had just survived a dicey alien invasion. The focus on the Dengari attack
gave B’Elanna a little breathing room. Most of the conversation kept drifting
back to the battles the crew had fought, and very few seemed focused on her and
Seven.</P>
<P>Chakotay managed to corner Seven near the buffet table. "Well, Seven, how is
married life treating you?" he asked with a warm smile. He cared deeply for
B’Elanna, he always had, and he had grown to respect and like Seven. He had been
surprised by the revelation of the wedding, but took it in stride.</P>
<P>"Commander, I am…adapting," Seven responded formally. She was completely out
of her element and all of the well wishes and emotional questions had forced her
back into her Borg responses.</P>
<P>"Hey, it’s just a question…not an interrogation." He moved closer and rested
his hand on the tall blonde’s shoulder. </P>
<P>Seven took a deep breath and sighed. "At the moment… I am…uncomfortable, but
that has nothing to do with B’Elanna," she said. Her voice sounded strained and
mechanical, except when she said B’Elanna’s name, then her lips curled and her
voice softened. Chakotay noticed.</P>
<P>"What about her?" He smiled and turned Seven to face the room of people. In
the far corner, B’Elanna was listening to Samantha Wildman explain something.
The Klingon looked mildly interested. "How are things with the two of you?"</P>
<P>Seven paused, studying him to assess what he wanted to know.</P>
<P>"Are you happy?" He smiled and squeezed her shoulder. </P>
<P>"Yes," she replied honestly.</P>
<P>"What’s your favorite thing about being married?" he asked. He wanted her to
focus on the happiness she shared with <I>Voyager’s</I> Chief Engineer, and not
the huge crowd milling around her.</P>
<P>"Everything." Seven smiled unconsciously and her eyes sparkled. "Going to
sleep beside B’Elanna, waking up next to her, knowing that we are thinking of
each other no matter where we are…" her voice trailed off as she watched her
wife. </P>
<P>Chakotay squeezed her shoulder again and leaned closer "Just think about that
and forget about everything else. This party will be over soon."</P>
<P>B’Elanna seemed to feel Seven’s gaze and she turned. She excused herself and
made her way to where Chakotay and Seven were standing.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," he said as he smiled brightly. "How are you?"</P>
<P>"Better now," she said as she wrapped her arm around Seven’s waist. "Miss
me?" she asked the exdrone.</P>
<P>"Always." Seven felt her body relax as B’Elanna rubbed the small of her back.
"What are we expected to do? What are our responsibilities for this
reception?"</P>
<P>"It’s a party," Chakotay said. "You just have to have fun."</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna chimed in. "We talk, eat some cake, maybe dance…"</P>
<P>"Cake?" Seven asked, her eyes brightening.</P>
<P>"Yes, my love…cake." B’Elanna shook her head and hoped it was a large cake.
Seven’s sweet tooth had grown exponentially since the pregnancy. And since they
didn’t have any honey on board… the cake would have to satisfy her.</P>
<P>"Speaking of cake," Chakotay said, sensing that they wanted to be alone, "Let
me go check on that."</P>
<P>B’Elanna watched him leave, her eyes tracking him until he disappeared into
the kitchen. She noticed the Captain talking with Tuvok near the kitchen, and
realized that Janeway hadn’t been over to speak to them yet. She wondered if it
was because of the discussion in the conference room, or if there was another
more personal reason.</P>
<P>"So, are you having fun?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Fun…is a relative term. I do not find the experience as distasteful as I had
anticipated." She scanned the room, her eyes stopping on Tom Paris who was
sitting at a table with Harry Kim. "However, I am…surprised that certain members
of the crew chose to attend."</P>
<P>B’Elanna followed her gaze and sighed. "We have to work together, and the
sooner Tom realizes that he and I are not going to get back together, the sooner
he can move on. Besides, I think Harry talked him into coming."</P>
<P>Seven quirked one eyebrow up. "I shall have to remember to properly thank
Ensign Kim," Seven said, but her expression suggested it would not be a pleasant
expression of gratitude.</P>
<P>"Harry’s just trying to smooth things out," B’Elanna assured her.</P>
<P>"Do you miss him?" Seven asked. She hadn’t voiced her deepest fears yet, that
B’Elanna would see Tom and realize she still had feelings for him.</P>
<P>"I care about him. I don’t want to see him hurt, but it’s friendship, nothing
more." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and squeezed it. "It’s you I love."</P>
<P>"But Ensign Paris is… more sociable, the crew likes him. I am… Borg. I do
not…fit in," Seven said quietly.</P>
<P>"If the crew is so fond of him, they can date him," B’Elanna said as she
lifted Seven’s hand to her lips. "I’ve got the one I want right here."</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven smiled. </P>
<P>"For what?"</P>
<P>"Making me feel more at ease here… loving me… tolerating my mood swings."
Seven glanced down as she said the last part. The truth was, Seven was terrified
to be in the large crowd. She had grown used to being alone with B’Elanna on the
planet, and being thrown back into the <I>Voyager</I> social setting was
overwhelming enough but being tossed into a reception with almost every member
of the crew present was testing the limits of her abilities. Add to that, that
Tom was there, studying every move the exdrone made as if waiting for a chance
to woo B’Elanna back to him, and it made for a very stressful event.</P>
<P>"It’s part of being married." B’Elanna slid next to Seven and draped her arm
around the blonde’s waist. "Now, since I have to ‘enjoy’ myself, I think you
should give it a try."</P>
<P>"I enjoy where your hand is," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna looked around the room. With exception of Tom, everyone
else seemed genuinely happy for her and Seven. "Love, these people are our
family. I know we haven’t seen them in a long time, but they are here because
they want to celebrate our union. Try to remember that."</P>
<P>"Does this mean you will forgive Naomi for ‘surprising us?" Seven gave
B’Elanna a sideways glance.</P>
<P>"Yes…I wasn’t really mad. It’s just that…it’s hard for me to… let my hair
down in front of the crew, too." The Klingon studied the carpeting, then
whispered, "I’m still adjusting to being back on board, too."</P>
<P>"I will… try," Seven promised.</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven tightened her grip around B’Elanna’s waist.</P>
<P>"Hmm?" She looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"Chakotay mentioned dancing. I would enjoy that very much." </P>
<P>"Oh?" B’Elanna asked. "You’d enjoy running your hands over my body in public?
Is that what you’re saying?" She was smiling, and shifted her body so that she
was pressing face to face against Seven, their bodies drawn together in a
familiar embrace. The contact did wonders for both of them. They each drew
strength from the other and felt their bodies relaxing.</P>
<P>"I enjoy running my hands over your body regardless of my location." Seven
demonstrated by letting her hands rest on B’Elanna’s hips. She loved the feeling
of the small Klingon’s body, soft curves and steel muscles, perfectly blended
creating a package that was perfection personified. She rubbed B’Elanna’s back,
pressing their chests together even more. </P>
<P>"I think we should ask Neelix to play some music," B’Elanna said as she let
the sweetness of the contact wash through her. "People are starting to
stare."</P>
<P>"Do you care?" Seven asked as she leaned down and nipped the Klingon’s lips.
Perhaps this ‘getting comfortable’ around the crew was not as bad as she had
first thought. If kissing B’Elanna was allowable, she would put up with a crowd
ten times bigger.</P>
<P>"Nope, I couldn’t care less," B’Elanna answered as she welcomed a kiss that
made her legs turn to liquid. Part of her was still a bit nervous, but the touch
of Seven’s lips drowned out any remaining tension. She let her weight slump
against her wife as the kiss deepened. She knew Seven would hold her up, and she
lost herself in Seven’s arms. Soon the kiss was more intense than would normally
be considered appropriate in public, but it was their wedding reception after
all.</P>
<P>A loud crash startled them and they broke the kiss and turned toward the
sound. Tom Paris was standing at a table with his drink and dinner plate
shattered at his feet. Harry had Tom by the arm, trying to hold him in place.
Tom glared at Seven, then turned and left the mess hall without bothering to
pick up his spilled meal. </P>
<P>He stalked out of the room, his mind clouded by the anger and resentment that
was tearing away at him. B’Elanna was his. Why couldn’t anyone see that? Sure,
they had a little crimp in their relationship, but that didn’t give Seven the
right to pounce on B’Elanna. It had been a misunderstanding. Sleeping with a
hologram wasn’t cheating…it was like masturbating, and he shouldn’t have to make
excuses for that, he rationalized. Now B’Elanna was throwing that damn Borg in
his face, probably just to get back at him for the holographic barmaid.</P>
<P>When Tom had agreed to come to the reception with Harry, he had expected it
to be a fiasco. He didn’t believe B’Elanna could put up with Seven for any
length of time. Sure, Seven was hot, but that only went so far. She was also the
most annoying woman on board, and a cold blooded automaton… a Borg. He half
expected the two to get into a fight before the reception even got under way.
But from the look of the kiss they had just shared, passion wasn’t a problem,
and it became very clear that if wanted to get B’Elanna back, he was going to
have to work very hard to get Seven out of the picture.</P>
<P>Seven pulled away from B’Elanna and moved toward the exit, but the compact
Klingon had her by the upper arm.</P>
<P>"Going somewhere?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Yes. I am going to have a discussion with Ensign Paris." Seven had stopped,
not wanting to yank out of her wife’s grip.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "Leave him alone. This isn’t the
time or the place."</P>
<P>"It is past time," Seven said. "He has been making derogatory comments about
our union since we returned. I intend to stop him."</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna repeated. "He’s my responsibility. Leave him to me." She could
feel Seven’s muscles ripple under her fingers as the tension in her body bubbled
to the surface. B’Elanna briefly wondered if perhaps she should have converted
to human rituals instead of introducing Seven to the hotheaded Klingon ways.</P>
<P>"We will discuss this later," Seven said. It was not a question but a
statement of fact.</P>
<P>"Okay, but right now, will you dance with me?" B’Elanna tried to distract her
wife.</P>
<P>"All right." Seven’s muscles softened as she took a deep breath and let it
out in a long sigh.</P>
<P>Neelix had come out of the kitchen in time to see the minor disagreement. He
hurried over in time to hear the end of the conversation.</P>
<P>"Did I hear you mention dancing?" he asked. "Well, now Seven… a little bird
told me that you are quite a singer. Maybe we could talk you into singing
something to your lovely wife for the first dance?"</P>
<P>"First dance?" Seven asked him, then turned to her wife. "I believe that
little bird should have kept its Klingon beak shut."</P>
<P>"Wasn’t me," B’Elanna said quickly. "The only person I told…" Her eyes
narrowed and she spun around searching the crowd. "Harry!"</P>
<P>The handsome operations officer smiled knowing that he was probably safe in
the room full of people. "Come on, B’Elanna…you tell me Seven has the voice of
an angel…that she used to sing to you under the full moons of Jusari Prime, and
then expect me not to tell anyone?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt her face warm as her cheeks blushed bright red.</P>
<P>"That was private, Harry," B’Elanna hissed.</P>
<P>The crowd pressed in to add their suggestions, all of them eager to hear the
exBorg sing.</P>
<P>Kathryn stepped forward. "You can’t keep a talent like that all to yourself,"
the captain joked.</P>
<P>"What is this first dance?" Seven didn’t seem bothered by the prospect of
singing. In fact, she seemed quite focused on the dance.</P>
<P>"It’s a tradition for the married couple to share the first dance," B’Elanna
said as she held out her hand to Seven. "It’s a way of beginning the dancing for
the evening."</P>
<P>"You said we share the first dance? Are we prohibited from dancing together
after the ‘first dance’?" Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and playfully yanked the
Klingon to her, wrapping her in her arms. This relaxing in public did have its
advantages.</P>
<P>"No." B’Elanna smiled up at Seven. "It’s a matter of who can steal us away
from each other for the rest of the night."</P>
<P>Seven slowly scanned the room, giving them her best Borg glare. "That would
be…unwise." Most of the guests seemed nervous, then Seven smirked, and the room
erupted in laughter, but for once it was not mocking. It was welcoming, they
were laughing with her for a change, and it felt good, very good.</P>
<P>"Come on," Harry yelled over the laughs. "I want to hear this angel."</P>
<P>"Here, here," Janeway said. She was being the ‘good captain,’ but inside she
didn’t know how much more she could take. It was hard enough watching them
together without seeing Seven serenade B’Elanna.</P>
<P>Neelix held out a data padd. "Why don’t you pick out something nice, and I’ll
have the comm system provide the music."</P>
<P>"I am unaccustomed to musical accompaniment," Seven said. She scanned the
choices on the padd and then paused and smiled. "I am… familiar with this one."
She gave B’Elanna a lingering gaze.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened as she considered a few songs she didn’t want to
share with the crew.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and tilted her head to one side. "You will like it," she assured
her wife.</P>
<P>B’Elanna released a breath, and relief washed over her face. Most of the crew
suddenly wanted to know which song had B’Elanna so spooked. For her part, Seven
realized that in public, she had an advantage with B’Elanna she didn’t have in
private. When B’Elanna joked with her or teased her in private, Seven was often
at a disadvantage because B’Elanna had much more experience. But here, in
public, B’Elanna seemed much more likely to blush. She made a point to be
careful not to embarrass her proud wife too much, but knew how to press an
advantage to its fullest. She also wanted to stop hiding her feelings for
B’Elanna, and this dance would be the perfect way to ‘open up.’</P>
<P>Seven handed Neelix the padd and the Talaxian ushered the couple to the small
area that had been set aside for the dance floor. He went to the comm station
and called up the musical file while B’Elanna and Seven stood together and
prepared to dance. The sound of soft guitar chords filled the crowded room and
Seven looked into B’Elanna’s eyes.</P>
<P>"I may be singing this in a room for full of people, Be’nal, but…as always…I
sing these words to you." Seven leaned down and kissed B’Elanna’s cheek and then
began to sing.</P>
<P>"<FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>Lying here with you, listening to the rain.
Smiling just to see the smile upon your face,"</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
</FONT>Seven sang as she moved her wife around the dance floor.</P><FONT
face=Arial size=2>
<P><BR></FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>"These are the moments I thank God
that I’m alive; These are the moments, I’ll remember all my life; I found all
I’ve waited for…And I could not ask for more,"</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
</FONT>the former drone continued. She smiled at B’Elanna whose eyes were
shining as she fought back tears. She had heard Seven sing this song to her many
times on the planet, but somehow hearing it in front of her friends made it all
the more real.</P>
<P>Across the room, Kathryn backed into the kitchen, touched by the display, but
feeling the need to flee. Everything she could have had with Seven was being
laid out in front of her and it was torture. She fought the urge to run, as she
had seen Tom Paris do, because she was captain, and it wouldn’t be right to
leave.</P>
<P>Seven moved one hand up to cup B’Elanna’s cheek and she caressed her tender
skin with her thumb.</P>
<P>"<FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>Looking in your eyes, seeing all I need.
Everything you are is everything to me</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>,"
</FONT>Seven sang, her voice beginning to crack, but it didn’t detract from the
beauty of the words, it added to them. Her voice was clear and in perfect pitch,
but the emotion making her voice deepen was beginning to make many of the guests
begin to cry. They hadn’t known the exBorg was capable of emotion, let alone the
absolute devotion they were witnessing.</P><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>
<P>"These are the moments, I know heaven must exist</FONT><FONT face=Arial
size=2>." </FONT>Seven let go of B’Elanna face and let her hand drift back down
to the Klingon’s waist<FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>. "These are the moments I
know all I need is this. I have all I’ve waited for, and I could not ask for
more."</P></FONT>
<P>B’Elanna’s hand drifted off of Seven’s hip and slid around and rubbed the
exdrone’s belly.</P>
<P>Seven smiled.<FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans"
size=2>"I could not ask for more than this time together. I could not ask for
more than this time with you," </FONT>she sang, and then placed her hand over
B’Elanna’s on her belly, holding her wife’s palm over their child<FONT
face="Lucida Sans" size=2>. "Every prayer has been answered. Every dream I
have’s come true. And right here in this moment is right where I’m meant to be…
Here with you here with me."</P></FONT>
<P>It was too much for Kathryn… B’Elanna’s hand cradling Seven’s belly, cradling
the child they created, a child Kathryn would never have. She had to get out,
away from everyone and everything. She moved through the crowd as Seven and
B’Elanna danced during an instrumental section of the song. She ended up
standing a few feet away from the dancing couple when Seven began singing again.
The crowd was frozen, mesmerized by the incongruity of a Borg drone using her
words to make love to a Klingon warrior in a crowded room. Kathryn was in hell,
of that she was certain.</P><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>
<P>"These are the moments I thank God that I’m alive."</FONT><FONT face=Arial
size=2> </FONT>Seven was now ignoring everyone else in the room as she watched
the love in B’Elanna’s eyes mirror her own.<FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT><FONT
face="Lucida Sans" size=2>"These are the moments I’ll remember all my life; I’ve
got all I’ve waited for…And I could not ask for more."</P></FONT>
<P>As Seven repeated the chorus, Kathryn pushed through the crowd. She didn’t
noticed the confused glances from her crew, or the fact that B’Elanna chose that
moment to shift her gaze to the movement in the otherwise still room. The
Klingon saw the captain’s expression as she hurried out the door, and for a
moment B’Elanna’s heart ached for her friend and mentor, but Seven’s words
pulled B’Elanna’s eyes and heart back.</P><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>
<P>"I could not ask for more than the love you give me ‘Coz it’s all I’ve waited
for,"</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT>Seven sang in a whisper<FONT
face=Arial size=2>. </FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>" And I could not ask
for more."</FONT> Seven leaned down and kissed B’Elanna as she finished the
song.<FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>"I could
not ask for more."</P></FONT>
<P>The crowd watched as the two women continued dancing as the music finally
ended. Somewhere in the back of the room, someone began to clap and it spread
through the crowd. B’Elanna blushed and rested her forehead against Seven’s
chest to hide her face, enjoying the warm softness, considering it one of the
perks of married life.</P>
<P>Neelix was speechless and had tears staining his furry, spotted cheeks. He
grumbled and rushed over to the couple and threw his arms around them both and
blubbered like a lost child. Seven didn’t know what to do with the distraught
Talaxian. B’Elanna, however, didn’t have that problem.</P>
<P>"Neelix… geeze." She shoved him away, then laughed as she wiped her eyes and
addressed the crowd. "The first one who laughs is going out an airlock."</P>
<P>The crowd responded with the expected laughs and filtered onto the dance
floor. This was the B’Elanna Torres they knew. B’Elanna tugged Seven to the back
of the room where they could both compose themselves.</P>
<P>"You really got me, ya’ know that?" B’Elanna asked as she pinned Seven to the
wall near the long window, the passing stars transformed into thousands of white
streaks.</P>
<P>"I hope I keep you," Seven said. She wiped her eyes. "I have sung that song
to you many times. I do not understand why we both reacted so strongly on this
occasion. Could it have been the addition of music?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna assured her. "It’s because all of our friends are here, and
telling me those words in front of them… just… just makes it more…"</P>
<P>"Real?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah." B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"Not all of our friends," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"I miss them too." B’Elanna sighed and leaned against Seven. "I wonder how
big Ty is getting?"</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, with the time differential, we left Jusari Prime a few hours after
he did."</P>
<P>"That’s true." B’Elanna smiled. "So… even with the delays the Dengari caused,
we should catch up with them soon."</P>
<P>"If they are going to Nador Omega as planned, they will be on our projected
flight path," Seven said happily.</P>
<P>"I can’t wait. Did I mention? I really love you." B’Elanna looked behind
Seven, noticing that many of the guests were staring. ‘<I>Eat your hearts
out,</I>’ B’Elanna thought. <I>‘She’s all mine.’ </I>Then she thought about the
captain and the look of devastation on her face when she ran from the room and
her smile disappeared.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven noticed the shift in B’Elanna’s mood and didn’t like the
sorrow covering her wife’s beautiful features.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned into Seven, squeezing her in a tight embrace. "Tom’s not the
only one who’s hurting over this."</P>
<P>"By <I>this</I>, you mean us? Am I correct?" Seven asked as she rubbed
B’Elanna’s back. She was thankful that the crowd seemed to be leaving them alone
for the moment.</P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna leaned back and looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"Who else is in love with you?" Seven’s concern was genuine, but there was a
hint of jealousy in her tone.</P>
<P>B’Elanna allowed a tiny smile. "Not me, love."</P>
<P>"Elaborate." Seven’s face showed her confusion. She leaned around B’Elanna
and scanned the crowd but didn’t see anyone who looked like they were in love
with her.</P>
<P>Naomi chose that moment to interrupt. B’Elanna wasn’t sure she if was upset
or relieved, but she smiled at the child and moved to stand next to Seven.</P>
<P>"Gosh, Seven, I didn’t know Borg could sing." Naomi reached out and tugged on
B’Elanna’s jacket. "Can Klingons sing, too?" She had first noticed the leather
coat when the three had been locked in Cargo Bay two, but hadn’t felt
comfortable enough with the Klingon to ask about it then, let alone touch
it.</P>
<P>"No, squirt," B’Elanna said. "Not this Klingon at least."</P>
<P>"How do you know it is not my human half that allows me to sing?" Seven
tilted her head and raised an eyebrow at Naomi.</P>
<P>"Well, because… It was perfect," Naomi rationalized. "Human’s aren’t perfect,
Borg are."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Naomi Wildman," Seven said in her most Borg tone.</P>
<P>"Pretty good logic, kid," B’Elanna complimented.</P>
<P>Naomi scrunched her face, finding the statement somewhat distasteful.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked</P>
<P>"I am very adult, B’Elanna. Everyone says so." Naomi seemed almost offended
to be called a kid.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna knelt in front of the half Katarian. "Do you get lonely being
the only kid?"</P>
<P>"Mom says the crew will start having kids in a few years so <I>Voyager</I>
can become a generational ship." Naomi looked down at the floor. "I just have to
wait."</P>
<P>"That’s not what I asked." B’Elanna lifted Naomi’s chin. "Do you get
lonely?"</P>
<P>"Sometimes…"</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked up at Seven. The exdrone smiled and knelt next to B’Elanna so
that she could also be on Naomi’s level. "Naomi?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Hmm?" Naomi bit her lip.</P>
<P>"You will not have to wait much longer." Seven smiled.</P>
<P>"Huh?" Naomi looked at Seven like she had just sprouted new implants out of
her forehead.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and then sighed. "Naomi, you aren’t gonna be the only kid
for very much longer. Seven and I are gonna’ have a baby."</P>
<P>"Really?" Naomi’s eyes and mouth shot open.</P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"So…" Naomi began calculating all the possible data. "So…if it’s your
baby…<I>and</I> Seven’s…it’s gonna’ be a girl, right?"</P>
<P>"Uh…yes," B’Elanna said, drawing out the words.</P>
<P>Naomi rolled her eyes. "B’Elanna, I’m not a little kid. My Mom is in the
Biosciences. If you two both gave genetic material, the baby has to be a girl.
Neither one of you has a Y chromosome. Duh."</P>
<P>"Duh," Seven said as she crossed her arms and smiled at B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Baby?" Harry Kim squeaked from behind Naomi. "You’re gonna’ have a baby?" he
said loudly. B’Elanna and Seven stood as several of the guests turned and came
closer.</P>
<P>Chakotay cleared his throat. "That wasn’t in your report on the away
mission," he said calmly.</P>
<P>If you asked anyone on board, they would say that Tuvok was immune to
curiosity and gossip. The Vulcan was not, he simply knew how to bide his time
until the perfect moment arose to ask questions. It was time to get the answers
to the questions he had been posing since he had learned of the child’s
existence.</P>
<P>"Congratulations," the Vulcan said. "Who is carrying this child?" He wasn’t
known for his tact.</P>
<P>"I am." Seven smiled when B’Elanna’s hand drifted over and covered her belly.
Any mention of the child seemed to force B’Elanna’s hand onto Seven’s belly, and
the exdrone loved it.</P>
<P>"A baby?" Neelix asked, wonder filling his voice. He went directly to Seven,
a smile covering his furry face. "A new life… oh, how wonderful." He reached for
Seven’s belly, then stopped. "May I?" he asked.</P>
<P>Seven seemed confused then realized that he wanted to touch her stomach the
way B’Elanna always did. She nodded slowly. "Proceed."</P>
<P>B’Elanna moved her hand and smiled at him. He looked like a child on
Christmas morning.</P>
<P>Neelix quickly got on his knees so that his face was at the same level as
Seven’s belly. He placed his hands on each side of her navel and his grin got
even wider until it threatened to split his face.</P>
<P>"Well, hello there, little one," he said to Seven’s belly. He looked up at
Seven, then B’Elanna. Around them the crowd was growing. "You have two wonderful
mommies waiting to meet you," he continued, his hands warm and gentle on Seven’s
stomach. "I’m kind of excited myself. It’s been a long time since I’ve held a
baby. Not since little Naomi was a baby. Now, you just take your time in there,
don’t let old Neelix rush you, but anytime you need a story… or to be tucked in,
you just call Neelix." He stopped, suddenly aware that the entire room of people
was staring. He looked up at Seven who had a soft smile tugging at the corners
of her lips. "Guess you think I’m pretty silly," he said as he stood and backed
up, but the smile didn’t leave his face.</P>
<P>"On the contrary," Seven said. "I was just thinking how much you remind me of
B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Seven," the Klingon said, trying to hush the exdrone.</P>
<P>"I cannot tell you how many nights I have awakened to the sounds of B’Elanna
talking to the baby," Seven continued despite the blush creeping up B’Elanna’s
face. "I worry that she will suffocate. I find her under the blankets deep in
conversation with our child. She insists it is a perfectly normal behavior."
Seven smiled at B’Elanna, enjoying her mate’s squirming.</P>
<P>"Of course it is," Neelix assured her.</P>
<P>"It is normal behavior for Mister Neelix," Tuvok said. "It has yet to be seen
if it is normal behavior for the rest of the population."</P>
<P>The crowd laughed and B’Elanna wanted to crawl into a hole, under a rock, or
at least out an airlock, but she was equally drawn to the idea of hiding under a
warm blanket with the cause of her torment. She decided that was the most
appealing prospect, and yanked Seven to her.</P>
<P>"Honey," she whispered sweetly, making sure it was loud enough for anyone
close by to hear. "When we get home tonight… you can just forget about me
telling the ‘baby’ a bedtime story and rubbing your back."</P>
<P>Then Seven surprised B’Elanna, and used her secret weapon. Seven frowned, let
her eyes take on a doe like quality and made her lower lip tremble, a move
B’Elanna had dubbed the Borg pout maneuver, and, like always, it worked.</P>
<P>"Oh, all right…you can have your back rub," B’Elanna relented instantly.</P>
<P>Seven clicked the pout maneuver up a notch, tilting her head to the side.</P>
<P>"And the bedtime story," B’Elanna added.</P>
<P>"Whipped," Harry said as he shook his head.</P>
<P>"Curious," Tuvok said with a raised eyebrow. "I did not think adults indulged
in bedtime stories."</P>
<P>This time is was Seven who blushed. Those around her thought it was because
she had been caught in childlike behavior, but they were mistaken. She was
thinking about the frightening tales B’Elanna would tell her, and the unique way
the Klingon would…calm her. Wonderful ways, starting with bone melting kisses
and ending with Seven sprawled across the bed in a hyperventilating puddle.</P>
<P>Seven turned to address the Vulcan. "I must learn these tales so that I can
share them with our child."</P>
<P>"Of course," Tuvok said…obviously unconvinced.</P>
<P>The rest of the evening was a happy blur, the highlight of which was the
cutting of the cake. After convincing Seven that the huge cake wasn’t one big
Borg maternity snack, B’Elanna had enjoyed feeding a small slice to her wife.
The crowd had been somewhat disappointed that the two women chose to forgo the
traditional cake fight, but they seemed honestly pleased with the new sides they
had seen of both women. When the last of the guests filtered out, they all saw
Seven as much more human, and B’Elanna as much less…volatile. No one commented
about Tom storming out or the captain’s hasty exit. Although, most assumed
Janeway’s departure was related to ship’s business.</P>
