<!-- Telling Series \ Section 4: Carmen - Well, That Was Unexpected -->

<p>"Well, that was unexpected." </p>
<p>"Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. You think she's OK?" Sam
shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno, maybe we should check," Brooke bent over the prone
form of Carmen Ferrera and felt for a pulse. She looked back up at her
girlfriend and nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup, still got a pulse. It's going like a freight train, but
it's beating," she said as she stood back up. They were in the Novac after
school had ended and had run into Carmen. Figuring it was now or never, they had
sprung the news of their relationship on the girl who was wondering about
Harrison's strange behavior lately. Of course, neither girl had expected it to
result in Carmen ending up flat on her back, unconscious on the floor of the
Novac. Well, life was full of funny little surprises. </p>
<p><br><font color="#3399FF">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oh...a flashback </font> </p>
<p>"Either of you know why Harrison would rather sit with April Tuna and Freddy
Gong than the rest of us? I mean, I know our social skills may be somewhat
lacking, except maybe for you Brooke, but really, I mean, April Tuna?" Carmen
asked. Brooke looked at Sam in the mirror as she fixed her eyeliner. Sam looked
around the Novak and saw that it was just the three of them and nodded.
</p>
<p>"We might, Carmen. Have you heard anything strange lately?
About us, I mean?" Sam asked nonchalantly. (Well, she hoped she sounded that way
at least) Carmen thought a minute and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not really. Just that you two are close. Although Emory was
saying in Bio class yesterday that you were a little more than close lately but
Lily smacked him with a petrie dish and he shut up real quick, why?" Brooke
winced. She knew that she and Sam were getting a little noticable with their
`friendly' touchy-feely lately and someone was bound to notice. (But Emory Dick?
ARGH) </p>
<p>"Well, we've been meaning to talk to you about that," Brooke
started as she watched Sam pick at her nails and blow a bubble with her gum.
(Oh, gee thanks, Sam) she thought sarcastically, shooting Sam a glare in the
mirror. Sam caught it and immediately joined the conversation. </p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, we uhm, we had Harrison over for dinner the other
night while you were away and told him something that upset him. I mean, MAJORLY
upset him. We thought he was going to have a stroke right there in the kitchen,"
Sam offered as an explaination. Carmen smiled at her friends. </p>
<p>"Gee, Sam, did you cook?" Carmen teased. </p>
<p>"No, Brooke did. I like Harrison and would not inflict my
cooking on him. But that's not why he freaked. I'm telling you, Carm, this was
bad. Worse than I've seen before." </p>
<p>"Come on, it can't be that bad. I'm sure whatever it was,
he'll get over it. He always does. He's Harrison. It's not like you told him you
two were gay and seeing each other," Carmen laughed. Brooke snapped the eyeliner
in her hand in two by accident and Sam choked on her gum. Brooke walked over and
pounded on her back. Sam wondered if one of these days she was going to choke to
death when someone sprung that on her while she was eating. </p>
<p>(First Mom, now Carmen. Between them and Nicole using me for
roadkill, I'd be down to like six lives if I were a cat) the morbid part of her
counted down. </p>
<p>"You OK, Sam?" Carmen asked alarmed. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Fine," she said although her voice was nothing more than a
froggy rasp. (Good thing I don't take choir) Brooke tossed the offending piece
of gum in the trash. </p>
<p>"Wow, Sam, talk about a violent reaction. I thought you and
Brooke were getting along now," Carmen continued. Sam looked at Brooke, her eyes
desperately begging her to handle this one. (I told Harrison, it's your turn)
Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"We are getting along, Carmen. That's just it. We told
Harrison exactly what you just said." Carmen tilted her head to the side as she
tried to follow the conversation. </p>
<p>"Sam's allergic to Double Bubble?" Sam rammed her head into
the wall several times. </p>
<p>"I really wish you wouldn't resort to banging your head into
solid objects like that, Sam. I spent way too long begging you to wake up from
your coma to watch you put yourself into a new one," Brooke sighed at her
girlfriend who gave her a sheepish smile. She pointed to Carmen with an
exasperated look on her face. </p>
<p>"Can you blame me?" Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not really," she turned back to Carmen. "No, Carm, the other
part. About Sam and I being gay and seeing each other. Only we aren't just
seeing each other, we are deeply in love with each other. Do you follow?"
</p>
<p>Carmen never actually heard the entire question that Brooke
had asked her, she was all ready passed out on the plush carpeting. </p>
<p>
<font color="#3399FF">Which ends our little flashback&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </font> </p>
<p>
<br>
"Do you think we should get someone?" Brooke asked nervously as she watched
Carmen twitch slightly on the floor. Sam looked down from where she calmly sat
on the couch and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nah, she'll come around in a few minutes. It's kinda funny
though," she laughed. Brooke shot her a dirty look. </p>
<p>"It is not, Sam. She could have hurt herself," Brooke
admonished. Sam looked away, giving the impression she was ashamed, which she
really wasn't. </p>
<p>"Sorry, I just didn't expect her to faint dead away like that.
I mean, come on, Brooke. She was out before she hit the ground. Her eyes rolled
up in her head, down she went and BOOM, right onto the floor. Last time I saw
someone turn that green was when we delivered Mac and I thought you were going
to pass out on me." Brooke stuck out her tongue but could help joining Sam for
the laugh. </p>
<p>"If I recall correctly, you were a little freaked yourself,
Sammy," another thought occurred to her. "If this is any indication, Carm's not
going to take this well," she said sadly. Sam sat up a little further on the
couch and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Apparently not. But look at it this way, at least Harrison
won't have to sit all alone. Or with April Tuna and Freddy Gong. Which is worse
do you suppose? Solitary or eating with those two? If you can eat, that is," she
asked. Brooke gave her another dirty look. </p>
<p>"We're tearing everything, everyone apart," Brooke complained.
Sam got up off the couch and gave Brooke a fierce hug. </p>
<p>"Would you have rather stayed quiet? Or better yet, never
started this relationship at all?" Sam asked in all seriousness. (Please don't
answer that the wrong way. Please don't think we're a mistake!) Sam begged
quietly. Brooke turned around in Sam's arms so that they were nose to nose. She
frowned as she stared into Sam's rich brown eyes, which were clouded with worry
and fear. </p>
<p>"Neither. You?" She watched the worry and fear leave Sam's
eyes to be replaced with joy and relief. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Me either. I finally feel complete when you're in my arms,
Brooke. I wouldn't trade that for anything. And if my friends, our friends can't
accept that or us, then they weren't very good friends to begin with, were
they?" Sam asked as she nuzzled Brooke's cheek. Brooke let out a happy and
contented sigh just as a groan of regaining consciousness came from Carmen. </p>
<p>"Another country heard from," Sam added wryly as Brooke
disconnected from her arms and bent down to the reawakening girl. Carmen opened
her eyes and looked up into Brooke's concerned hazel ones. </p>
<p>"Feeling better, Carm?" Brooke asked gently. Looking from
Brooke to Sam standing a few feet behind her, Carmen promptly fainted again. </p>
