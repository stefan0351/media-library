<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 2: The Rescue -->

<p>Josie urged Phoenix along, following the sounds of a woman's
		screams. Soundlessly she slid from the horses back, and with the grace of a cat she crept
		to the edge of a clearing from which the sounds emanated. She saw two scruffy men holding
		a young woman while a third was pawing at her body.</p>

		<p>"Why don't you pick on someone your own size, boys?"
		Her voice startled the pawing man, who turned and began to reach for his gun. Josie's
		hands were quicker; she fired two shots into him before his gun was even half out of his
		holster. The other two let go of the girl and reached for their weapons. The
		sharp-shooting woman took them down with only one bullet each. If the truth were told, she
		could have killed the first man with only one bullet, but she felt that he deserved two
		for trying to rape the frightened woman.</p>

		<p>The blonde woman sunk to the ground and huddled herself into a
		small ball. Josie couldn't see the girl's face as it was buried in her arms, but the
		rescuer could tell she was crying. With a shrug, the gunslinger turned away from the girl
		and walked to where the men lay in pools of their own blood. She stripped the gun belts
		from their bodies, and searched their pockets for coins or anything else that might be
		usable. The one who had been trying to tear the clothes off the young girl had a pocket
		full of Confederate currency, and even more stuffed into the band inside his gray uniform
		cap. With a shake of her head, Josie dropped the bills on top of his prostrate form.
		"The south won't rise again...and neither will you, Johnny." She straightened up
		and gave a sharp whistle, and Phoenix stopped munching grass on the edge of the clearing
		and trotted obediently to her mistress' side. Josie draped the three gun belts around the
		saddle horn, and stuffed the coins and two knives she had taken off of the dead men into
		the saddlebags. After securing the leather straps on the saddlebags, she put her foot in
		the stirrup and smoothly vaulted into the saddle. She made a clicking noise with her
		tongue, and the horse broke into a trot. The sound of the hoof beats penetrated through
		the girl's stupor. </p>

		<p>"Wait!" The girl cried as she struggled to her feet.
		"You can't leave me here." She looked around at the blood soaked dead men, and
		the look in her eyes was that of a frightened child. "Please." She added
		quietly. </p>

		<p>Josie's keen hearing picked up on the absolute fear and
		helplessness in the girl's voice. Cursing under her breath, she reined in her horse, and
		urged her closer to the girl. "What's your name, girl?" She spoke in her most
		intimidating voice.</p>

		<p>"Re-Rebecca." She stammered. She looked up at the woman
		who had saved her. Dressed all in black save for the vest and scarf, the tall woman looked
		like death itself to the inexperienced farm girl. The only humanity she could see in the
		finely chiseled face was the piercing blue eyes.</p>

		<p>"Do you have a home around here?" The gunslinger asked.</p>

		<p>"N-No. I live in Chancetown." Josie groaned inwardly.
		Chancetown was several hours ride in the opposite direction. Looking around, the outlaw
		saw no signs of horses.</p>

		<p>"Where are their horses?" She demanded.</p>

		<p>"Uh..." Rebecca shook her head. "They had a
		wagon...I don't..."</p>

		<p>"I'm going to go have a look for it. Stay here!" Josie
		barked as she urged Phoenix out of the clearing.</p>

		<p>Two hours passed before Josie returned. Rebecca was sitting, once
		again curled up in a ball, as far away from the dead men as she could get, and still be in
		sight when the gunslinger returned. As she approached the clearing, Josie noticed the
		vultures starting to circle overhead. She stopped the horse in front of the girl. Rebecca
		looked up at her but said nothing.</p>

		<p>"I found the wagon. It had gone over the edge of a cliff. I
		had to shoot the horses." She had only been able to salvage a few of the drifter's
		goods, as most of them had been smashed beyond use in the fall down the hill, but she saw
		no need to share this information with the young woman.</p>

		<p>"How do I get back home?" Rebecca asked softly, her
		voice on the verge of breaking. She had never been away from home before and now she was
		with a woman who had just killed three men.</p>

		<p>Josie pointed in the direction of the town. "Go that way. On
		foot, it'll take you no more than a day." The girl nodded and slowly rose to walk
		away. Josie debated and argued with herself for a few moments before nudging Phoenix
		forward to catch the girl. Rebecca stopped as the woman in black dismounted.</p>

		<p>"Get up there. I'll drop you off outside of town."
		Rebecca looked up at the tall horse.</p>

		<p>"He's awfully big."</p>

		<p>"SHE'S a horse! They're supposed to be big." Josie
		snarled. Rebecca quickly moved to put her foot in the stirrup. Her long dress and endless
		petticoats made it impossible for her to mount the tall beast. Josie grabbed her and threw
		her on the ground. "Spread your legs." Rebecca looked at her, horrified. Josie
		grabbed one ankle and yanked her legs apart. Before the young woman could protest, she
		pulled a bowie knife out of her boot and stabbed through the material, halfway between the
		girl's hips and knees. After putting the knife back, Josie grabbed the torn material with
		both hands and ripped it the rest of the way down to the hem. "Stand up." Josie
		made no effort to help the frightened girl up. Rebecca climbed to her feet, still quite
		fearful of the woman with the guns. Josie boosted the terrified blonde up into the saddle
		and then mounted up behind her.</p>

		<p>The torn ends of the blonde woman's dress flapped in the wind as
		they made their way to Chancetown. Rebecca gripped the saddle horn with both hands as the
		large horse's hooves ate up the ground beneath them. Josie's hands rested on her own
		thighs, the left hand holding the reins. She was never comfortable with physical contact,
		unless she was fighting. This frightened child needed comforting, but that ability was not
		something that the outlaw was willing to do. All she wanted was to get the blonde safely
		home so she could get back to her own business.</p>

		<p>"Um...can I ask you something?" Rebecca said timidly.</p>

		<p>"You just did." She answered wryly.</p>

		<p>"Oh, well, I guess I did. I-I was just wondering what your
		name was. So I could thank you properly for saving my life."</p>

		<p>"You sure you want to know, little girl?" Josie
		taunted. The woman sitting in front of her nodded. "The name is Josie Hunter."</p>

		<p>Rebecca stiffened and gripped the horn even tighter. "Josie
		Hunter, the outlaw? Terror of the Train rails?" She stopped when she realized that
		the names might not go over so well with the heavily armed woman behind her.</p>

		<p>"The same." Josie replied. "Any more
		questions?"</p>

		<p>"What? Oh, no Jo-I mean..."</p>

		<p>"You mean to keep quiet and not bother me or I'll kill you
		without a thought." Josie said firmly. Rebecca pressed her lips together tightly and
		vowed to do just that.</p>
