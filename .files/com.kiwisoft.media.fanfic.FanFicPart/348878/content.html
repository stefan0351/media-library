<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 21 - Announcements & Horses-->

<P>Tom fingered the small velvet box in his hand, going over the many different
ways he could ask B'Elanna to marry him while sitting in the mess hall. Harry's
shift was about to end and Tom knew he'd be dropping by looking for him. Neelix
had already pestered him about what was inside the box. Not knowing human
marriage customs too well, Neelix thought it was just another gift for B'Elanna
when she got back. Harry on the other hand, would know right away.</P>
<P>Going over another proposal just under his breath, he was cut off by a big
slap on the back, and a yellow uniform sitting down across the table.</P>
<P>"So what's in the box?" Harry asked knowingly.</P>
<P>"Just some earrings for my favorite Klingon."</P>
<P>Tom smiled, handing Harry the box.</P>
<P>Harry quickly opened the box and saw a magnificent diamond, perfectly cut,
attached to the classic gold ring. Neelix who had his eyes on the box from
behind the counter the entire time, quickly rushed over, finally realizing the
magnitude of the box and the ring inside.</P>
<P>"I knew you were cheap Tom, but a diamond?" Harry joked.</P>
<P>"What can I say, I'm a traditionalist."</P>
<P>Neelix eagerly stood beside Harry, fidgeting almost out of control in
excitement, reaching out a hand to touch the box, and quickly retracting it, not
wanting damage the ring inside.</P>
<P>Tom laughed at the site of Neelix looking as if he'd been burnt by an open
flame.</P>
<P>"Go ahead Neelix, you can touch it."</P>
<P>That was all Neelix needed to pounce on the box and rip it out of Harry's
hands. </P>
<P>"Hey watch it there Neelix. Tom said you could touch it, not break it."</P>
<P>Harry rubbed the slight burn on his hand.</P>
<P>"This is beautiful," Neelix said in awe, looking at the perfect reflection of
light coming from the diamond. "When are you going to ask her?"</P>
<P>"As soon as she gets back," Tom said without hesitation.</P>
<P>"That's wonderful," Neelix cut off Harry. "Do you mind if I?" </P>
<P>Neelix turned his body slightly towards the rest of the crew in the mess
hall, the ring softly nestled in his cupped hands.</P>
<P>"Well actually, I think there's someone else that deserves that
opportunity."</P>
<P>Tom's eyes went from Neelix to Harry.</P>
<P>"Oh of course, how selfish of me."</P>
<P>Neelix handed the ring to Harry, who stood up gratefully, ring in hand.
Neelix grabbed Tom's glass and spoon and began tapping it excitedly.</P>
<P>"Attention everyone, attention everyone, Mr. Kim has an announcement to
make." </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna dropped the tergralium-laden rock from her hand when she felt
Seven's arms wrap around her body from behind and the young Borg's lips along
her neck. Seven tugged on B'Elanna's tank top with bra in hand, hoping the
half-Klingon would get the message. </P>
<P>"Seven," B'Elanna said gaspingly, unable to breathe properly with Seven's
gentle kisses on her neck and cheek. </P>
<P>"I caught you," Seven responded, still reveling in B'Elanna's presence.</P>
<P>"And now you want full access to my systems I suppose."</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned around, seeing the full beauty of her lover, as the water
glistened off of Seven's nude body, in the spectacular sunshine. </P>
<P>"Precisely."</P>
<P>Seven's hungry lips took command of B'Elanna's, cutting off any response,
except for the slight moans of approval. The forcefulness of the kiss surprised
B'Elanna momentarily, but she recovered, reciprocating with her own Klingon
eagerness. B'Elanna pulled Seven in possessively, not wanting to let her go.</P>
<P>The passion of the kiss seemed to last forever, and appeared to tire Seven
out. Breathless, Seven went slightly limp in B'Elanna's arms, knees weak, arms
drawn down by her side, and her face nuzzled into B'Elanna's neck.</P>
<P>"You okay?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked down at the top of Seven's head, hair still wet from the
waterfall.</P>
<P>"I believe so, I am just experiencing some disorientation, nothing to worry
about," Seven reassured unconvincingly. </P>
<P>"Disorientation? Like before?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna sat down on a rocky ledge just outside the cave mouth, holding Seven
gently in her arms. Taking her bra and Seven's bio-suit out of Seven's hands,
B'Elanna placed them on the nearest ledge without getting up.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered, blinking her eyes shut tightly. "I believe the
bio-electric field is growing in intensity and interfering with my systems,
particularly my motor functions," Seven managed to get out, talking into
B'Elanna's neck.</P>
<P>"And that's something I shouldn't worry about?" B'Elanna chastised. </P>
<P>Seven responded with a tiny murmur, too tired to speak.</P>
<P>"Seven?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart raced, tightly woven with fear. The change had happened so
quickly and without warning, that B'Elanna almost froze.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B'Elanna asked again with a trace of dread.</P>
<P>Seven desperately wanted to reassure her love that she was okay, but she was
unable to speak. Every time she attempted to form a word and release it,
something would grab it and take it away. The helplessness of not being able to
communicate verbally, not to mention visually, terrified the young Borg
immensely. Even worse was the fact that Seven seemed to be fully aware, her
mind, unaffected by the bio-electric interference. </P>
<P>B'Elanna saw the futile attempts at speech and tried not to panic. Almost
every cell in her body was telling her to run, hide, and just get the hell out
of there. <I>You're going to get hurt again B'Elanna. </I>She could hear herself
say, it was something she battled with all the time, since Claire. But the
stubborn half-Klingon knew she was too far into this to start running.</P>
<P>B'Elanna tilted Seven's head and saw the fear and dread that anyone would
have, if they were suddenly rendered speechless and motionless by some unseen
force. </P>
<P>"It's okay Seven, don't waste your energy trying to speak," B'Elanna said
softly, and kissed her on the forehead. "I'll take care of you."</P>
<P>Seeing the resolve in B'Elanna's eyes, brought a little comfort to Seven, who
was currently trapped in a prison of the mind with concrete walls.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's thoughts collided with each other and prevented her from doing
anything constructive. Until she could come up with some sort of plan, B'Elanna
figured the best thing was to reassure Seven that she had everything under
control. </P>
<P>The wind started to pick up a bit into a chilly breeze. Seven's shivering
gave B'Elanna a starting point for action and she looked around for anything
dry. Unfortunately everything seemed to be wet. Then she remembered her
Starfleet jacket and was sure she put it in a dry spot inside the cave. </P>
<P>B'Elanna grabbed Seven's wet bio-suit from the ledge and brought it just
inside the cave mouth along with Seven. Laying the wet suit on the sandy dirt,
B'Elanna explained that she was going inside to get her jacket and wanted Seven
to rest here. </P>
<P>"Don't worry I know what you're thinking. I'll wash your bio-suit after I get
back."</P>
<P>B'Elanna forced a smile, and kissed her lover softly on the cheek before
leaving.</P>
<P>B'Elanna ran through the dark cave. B'Elanna bumped into the side walls.
B'Elanna didn't care. Her goal was getting Seven safe and warm and she knew that
her jacket was the only dry thing to cover Seven up. Although the sun was
blazing hot, the wind had picked up again causing a cold breeze. This planet had
looked like paradise but was really a chaotic mess. </P>
<P>Finally seeing the dim light that signaled the waterfall, B'Elanna made one
final rush around the corner and began frantically looking for her jacket. She
swore under her breath knowing she had put it somewhere dry. But it was nowhere
in sight. Nervously, B'Elanna decided to wade just over ankle deep in the water
looking for her jacket. Her hands swished through the water endlessly looking
for what she was almost certain couldn't be there. But her right hand made
contact with her jacket and she felt the cold metal of her comm. badge. </P>
<P>Disheartened by her find, B'Elanna angrily threw her soaked jacket against
the wall, making a loud spat and the small distinct sound of metal against rock.
Wading back out of the pool, B'Elanna pursued her jacket and ripped at it, swung
it around and slapped it hard against the cave wall. She didn't care if she
broke her comm. badge, because the damn thing didn't work anyway on this planet,
at least not anymore.</P>
<P>Exhausted from beating her jacket and comm. badge, B'Elanna slid her back
down against a somewhat rough part of the cave wall into a sitting position. Her
hands covered her face ready for the torrent of tears she was expecting. But the
Klingon inside her knew this was not the time to cry, but the time for action.
But what action could she take with a worn down wet jacket and a non-verbal,
non-moving half Borg. </P>
<P>Besides the obvious predicament Seven was in, B'Elanna's stomach growled,
making her realize that Seven must be even hungrier since she hadn't eat very
many apples. Removing her hands from her face, B'Elanna's slightly tear-streaked
face registered a look of shock, fear, and doubt. For sitting only 4 meters on
the cave floor from her position was a basket. Inside the basket, there was a
clean white towel covering something underneath. </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubber her eyes hard, sure that it was an illusion. But the rubbing
didn't make the basket disappear. Carefully, B'Elanna inched towards the basket,
sure that this was some sort of trick. </P>
<P>"Parker!" B'Elanna shouted nervously. "Parker!"</P>
<P>But all she heard was the echo of her own voice. When she was within a meter
of the basket, B'Elanna stopped, inhaled deeply then pounced on the basket sure
that it would disappear if she didn't surprise it. Breathing intensely, B'Elanna
quickly grabbed the white towel to see what was underneath. Sandwiches, there
were sandwiches in the basket. </P>
<P>Either she was dreaming or somehow Voyager had managed to break through the
bio-electric interference, break through the life-sign masking tergralium, and
send exactly what she needed in a nice little basket. Only Voyager would never
send a basket with nicely prepared food and a towel. Voyager would have sent a
supply pack with rations and a first aid kit.</P>
<P>But B'Elanna was never one to look a gift-horse in the mouth. She grabbed the
basket and ran once again through the unforgiving dark tunnels, hoping nothing
had happened to Seven during her time away.</P>
