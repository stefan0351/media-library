<p>Title: Miley, Do You Want to Know a Secret?</p>
<p>Rating: T for language and minorly descriptive love scenes</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I don't own Hannah Montana or Disney or any of its affiliates, obviously.</p>
<p>A/N: This is my first Liley fic although I have been planning on getting to this category for a while. This is a story with a lesbian (obviously) pairing so if you're somehow offended by that idea, just press the back button, it's all good. Review please!</p>
<p>Lily's thoughts are in italics</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;"><u>Chapter 1</u></p>
<p>Jake stood proudly, chest puffed out, hair groomed back neatly, and flashed the professional photographer his trademark smile and a thumbs up. Jake gave the photographer another couple of shots and then greeted the steam of attendees who had begun to filter into the outside meadow where the wedding ceremony was to be held. When Jake Ryan did weddings, he did weddings big. Jake reserved the Lux Hotel in Maui, Hawaii and flew in the whole Stewart clan and Ryan family and all their friends. He spotted his beaming parents and let them sweep him up in a bear hug. Mrs. Ryan fused over her son's bowtie and fluffed his bangs.</p>
<p>"Mother, I already had my hair and makeup crew spruce me up, not that I need it, I mean look at me. I'm Jake Ryan!"</p>
<p>"Oh Leslie, you look so dashing my darling boy!" Mrs. Ryan exclaimed as she used a tissue to dab away tears from her eyes, she dare not smear her mascara.</p>
<p>"Don't call me that in public! We've talked about this, my name is Jake Ryan."</p>
<p>"You know son," Mr. Ryan chimed in, "If this whole thing doesn't work out with this Stewart chick, there's always plenty of high profile actresses and singers who would be all over a catch like you,"</p>
<p>"I know father, how could they resist me? But I like Miley, and better yet, so does the public. At first my legions of adoring female fans were so set against the loss of my single status but now they think I've humbled myself by dating a nobody and therefore they <i>all</i> love me!"</p>
<p>"Well son, if you ever have a lonely night, I've got Mikayla's number for you." Mr. Ryan nudged Jake.</p>
<p>"Thanks for the number dad but I'm sure Miley would be more than willing anytime I want to, I mean, look at me."</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the Ryan family, Lily stood mere feet away in the midst of a chattering crowd of guests. She heard every word the Ryans had said and felt disgusted.</p>
<p><i>This can't be happening, Miley is about to marry that jerk Jake who doesn't deserve her. All he cares about is his image and sex; she is too good for a pathetic loser like him. I have to stop Miley from making a huge mistake</i>. <i>I can't let her marry Jake Ryan.</i></p>
<hr size=1 noshade>She darted down the aisle, past the patio decorated for the reception, and into the hotel lobby as fast as she could in a dress and heels, and ran smack into Jackson and Oliver.<p>"Whoa, hey there Lily, a little excited? You look great in your maid of honor dress," Jackson complimented her.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to see Miley, I bet she's going to look amazing in her dress. Oh before I forget, Aunt Dolly told Robby Ray to tell me to tell you that Miley is looking for you."</p>
<p>"Oh I – was just – on my way to see her," Lily stammered, her head swimming with thoughts.</p>
<p>"That's good; well make it quick, the wedding starts soon! I can't believe my little sister is getting married already, but as long as she's happy…"Jackson mused.</p>
<p>"Yeah, happy…" Lily repeated quietly before turning down the adjacent hallway and to the hotel's elevators.</p>
<p>"What's up with her?" Oliver asked.</p>
<p>"Girls, they're a mystery, but boy some of them are begging to be solved," Jackson replied as he noticed a redhead bombshell waitress pass by and wink at him suggestively.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>Lily let out a heavy sigh as she leaned against the wall length mirrors parallel to the row of elevator lifts.<p>"So I may be a doughnut, but even I'm not so full of myself to notice something is a matter with you," Oliver commented as he discovered Lily's distressed state.</p>
<p>"Oliver…you are not funny. I'm fine, just – a little – nervous," Lily reassured Oliver, and herself.</p>
<p>"You're nervous? You're the maid of honor, not the bride. Are you afraid you're going to trip in your high heels? You do look odd in such…girl shoes," Oliver said.</p>
<p>"No! It's nothing like that it's…different, it's complicated."</p>
<p>"Whatever you say Lily, but you've got less than an hour to prove to Miley the truth that you've been trying to hide for way too long. Good luck, I'll be here in the lobby if you need any support or anything."</p>
<p>"Truth – pssh – pfft – what – what - are you talking about Oliver?" Lily failed miserably at trying to cover up her astonishment at his insight.</p>
<p>"Lily, I'm a guy, and we may not be the most observant of the sexes, but I'm also your best friend, best guy friend at least, and I see how much you care about Miley, how much you love her. Love…love her." Oliver revealed his observations to the flabbergasted girl.</p>
<p>"No it's not like that – it's just, Jake doesn't deserve her! He's an asshole, a complete egotistical dickhead, she can do so much better than him. He doesn't see her beauty, on the inside and out, he doesn't tell her how comforting her hugs are, how she lights up a room as soon as she enters…how her smile makes my heart flip, her sweet laughter always rings in my ears, how amazing she is. He doesn't understand…how much she means to me."</p>
<p>Oliver smiled as he shook his head at Lily, "honestly, I'd thought you'd never get around to admitting it."</p>
<p><i>Even Oliver saw right through me…before I even did. I guess boys can be useful. Now that I know what I need to do, I need to figure out how am I going to do it. How do I save Miley from a future with Jake, how do I convince her that I deserve her, how do I reveal to her, my secret? </i></p>
