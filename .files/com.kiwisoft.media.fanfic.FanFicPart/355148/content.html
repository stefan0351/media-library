<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty One -->

<p>Sam was getting worried. Since taking that hit in gym class two weeks ago, Brooke was getting progressively angrier. She barely ate, hardly slept, and wouldn't speak much, even to Sam. And every effort Sam made to draw the surly blonde out was met with harsh resistance and she was abruptly shut down. It seemed like the only time that Brooke had anything to say to her was when she wanted sex. Frankly Sam was getting tired of it. Brooke had promised her when they started that the relationship was more than a physical one but right now that all it was about. That wasn't what Sam wanted. She was just afraid of further pushing Brooke away if she said anything about it.</p>
<p>So she lay on her bed throwing a tennis ball against the wall trying to figure out what her options were. So far, she was coming up totally blank.</p>
<p>(If I say anything, she'll no doubt get mad and push me further away. I'll lose the one connection to her I do have) Sam contemplated.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, I really don't want this relationship to just be about an easy screw. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I went into. I really love her. Only coming to me for sex to make herself feel good is wrong and making me feel lousy. Used)</p>
<p>"ARGH!" she yelled, throwing the ball harder than she intended and watching as it bounced around the room until it shattered her lamp. She sighed.</p>
<p>"Oddly appropriate," she snorted. Her door opened with a gentle knock and Brooke walked in.</p>
<p>"Everything OK, Sammy?" she asked approaching the bed. Sam stayed lying on the bed and shrugged at her. </p>
<p>"Peachy keen, Brooke," she tossed out nonchalantly. Brooke frowned at her.</p>
<p>"You broke your bear lamp," she pointed out.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Sam agreed.</p>
<p>(If she can do the standoffish thing, damn it, so can I) she decided.</p>
<p>"You love that lamp. You told me that you've had it since you were seven," Brooke continued confused by Sam's behavior.</p>
<p>"I love a lot of things, Brooke," Sam said quietly. Brooke smiled and sat down on the bed next to her.</p>
<p>"Like me?" she asked starting to caress Sam's face and neck slowly. Sam felt her heartbeat speed up at the barest of Brooke's touches and scolded herself for it. She was going to get her point across if it killed her.</p>
<p>"Yes, like you," she said simply. Brooke lay down on the bed and started to kiss Sam's neck and jaw line. Her left hand snaked under Sam's NYC shirt and tickled the brunettes abs. Sam had to concentrate to control her body's automatic reactions to the gentle touches. She stared blankly at the ceiling counting the tiles.</p>
<p>"Hmmm?show me, Sam," Brooke purred as her tongue darted out to lick Sam's ear. Sam gasped before she could stop herself. "I love you, Sammy. I love the way you touch me, the way you make me feel. Make me feel that way now, Sammy. Please," Brooke was nearly begging as Sam continued to lie unmoving on the bed.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke," Sam sighed. Brooke sucked lightly on her pulse point.</p>
<p>"Come on, Sammy. You know you want to. Mom and Dad are visiting friends out of town and they took Mac with them. We're all alone. Why waste the time?" Brooke reasoned as her hands inched further up Sam's hot skin. Sam took a deep breath and mustered the last of her diminishing resolve.</p>
<p>"Because I said `no'," she said firmly, pushing Brooke's hands away and ignoring her body's cry of `yes!'. Brooke picked her head up from where her tongue had been worrying Sam's skin and stared at her in shock.</p>
<p>"What? Are you serious?" Brooke gasped disbelieving. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Very serious," she whispered.</p>
<p>"What? Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I don't feel like it. I want more than this, Brooke," Sam started to explain.</p>
<p>"Fine. Be like that you frigid little bitch," Brooke snapped angrily and moved to get off the bed. Sam bolted upright, ignoring the pain in her chest that the words caused and wrapped her arms tightly around the lithe blonde. She used her own arms to pin Brooke's to her side and moved to throw her legs over Brooke's. She had effectively pinned Brooke in place on the bed. She was desperate to talk to her even if she had to sit on her to do it.</p>
<p>"Let go of me," Brooke growled.</p>
<p>"Not until you listen to me," Sam said gently but firmly. Brooke laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>"What's to listen to, Samantha? How you finally got what you really wanted from me that you couldn't get from the old Brooke and now you're done with me?" Brooke hissed. "You're just as bad as everyone else."</p>
<p>"Brooke, you've got it all wrong. That's not what this is about?"</p>
<p>"Bullshit, Sam. You got what you wanted and now I'm being thrown aside."</p>
<p>"God, stop it! Listen to me!" Sam started to shout. She was getting frustrated and hurt that Brooke was so angry at her. She couldn't figure out what she had done wrong. All she wanted to do was talk and Brooke was verbally tearing her apart.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, you self-centered little brat! You used me, just like everyone else," Brooke accused.</p>
<p>"Me using you? That's rich! You're the one using me for a quick fuck!" Sam screamed as something inside her snapped at hearing Brooke's accusations and harsh words. All she could see was red as her own hurt and anger filled her.</p>
<p>"You barely speak to me anymore unless it's to have sex with me. You saunter in here, get off and get out. You twisted my feelings for the old Brooke to get what YOU wanted. It's pretty damn apparent from your recent behavior that you don't give a rat's ass about me. You say that you love me but you don't care about anyone but yourself. If anyone is using anyone here, McQueen, YOU are using ME!"</p>
<p>Brooke wrenched her arm free, reared back and slapped Sam with everything she had, rattling Sam's teeth and splitting her lip. Sam stared at her in mute hurt shock. As Brooke watched the trickle of blood ooze down Sam's chin she realized what she had just done.</p>
<p>"Shit, Sammy," she gasped in horror as Sam just kept watching her. "I am so sorry. I don't know what happened."</p>
<p>"You hit me," Sam said in a broken voice.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to. You just said those things and I don't know, I just?it hurt because it was so untrue and?I?I?I'm sorry," Brooke cried as tears streamed down her face. She felt so bad for what she'd done that her chest hurt. "I would never, ever hurt you." Sam reached up and wiped at the blood, smearing it over her fingertips in a state of morbid fascination.</p>
<p>"You've hit me before," Sam countered quietly as her brows came together in a deep scowl.</p>
<p>"What? When? Why?" Brooke asked stunned. Sam looked away and focused on some point on the far wall.</p>
<p>"It was shortly after Mom and I first moved in. You and I were fighting in the bathroom and you slapped me. Granted I probably deserved it that time but?"</p>
<p>"God, Sammy, I'm so sorry. For then but especially for now," Brooke apologized, reaching out to touch the wounded area. Sam flinched and pulled away.</p>
<p>"Don't touch me," Sam said softly. "Please, just don't touch me. At least for now."</p>
<p>"OK," Brooke sobbed heartbroken that she had done such a horrible thing to the girl that she loved with all her heart.</p>
<p>"Sadly, this is exactly the point I was trying to make, Brooke. Since you took that hit in gym something's been going on with you. You've been pulling away, closing me out, and only coming to me when you want something. When you're feeling needy or horny then you'll make time for me but otherwise I don't exist. You're using me and it's not fair," Sam explained quietly.</p>
<p>"I love you, Sammy," Brooke said between sobs.</p>
<p>"I know you do, Brooke. Despite what I said a few minutes ago, I don't have any doubt about that. But I've seen how you've been lately. Not eating, you hardly sleep but you won't tell me why," Sam continued in the same soft tired voice. "Why won't you talk to me anymore?" The hurt in Sam's voice was too much for Brooke to take as she realized how much her behavior wounded the brunette.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go back to my room now, Sammy. I'm sorry that I hit you. I swear that I'll never do it again. Please don't hate me," Brooke pleaded as she got up to leave. Sam sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"I'm never going to hate you, Brooke. Even for this. But please don't walk away from me right now. Talk to me, let me help you," Sam asked reaching out to rub Brooke's back as she sobbed. The simple contact of Sam touching her both eased the pain in her chest and made it somehow sharper.</p>
<p>"I'm so scared, Sammy," she confessed breaking down and curling into a ball.</p>
<p>"Of what, love? Me?" Brooke shook her head as Sam gathered the shaking girl into her arms.</p>
<p>"No, Sammy, never of you."</p>
<p>"Then tell me, Brooke. Tell me why you're so scared. Start with something small. Why aren't you able to sleep lately?" Brooke sighed and leaned back into Sam's embrace, drawing comfort from the strong and steady presence. </p>
<p>"I'm afraid?I'm afraid that I'll never wake up again," she said haltingly. Sam tilted her head.</p>
<p>"Oh, love, what do you mean?" Brooke took a deep breath to collect her thoughts. She really wanted Sam to understand what she was talking about and not just think she was a fruit loop.</p>
<p>"I'm scared that I'll go to sleep some night, but I won't be the one to wake up. Mouse will," she told Sam. Sam frowned.</p>
<p>"Mouse? Who's Mouse?"</p>
<p>"Sorry. I mean the old Brooke. I'm afraid that I'll go to sleep but she'll be the one to wake up and my time will be over. I'll be gone. I don't wanna die, Sammy," she sobbed uncontrollably. </p>
<p>"Oh Brooke. Is that what's been eating at you all this time? No wonder you've been so angry and cranky," Sam carefully kissed the crying girl's temple as she rocked her. Now Sam understood. Brooke was worried about that and needed to feel alive, that's why she kept coming to her the way she did. It wasn't to hurt her, in some odd way it was to ask Sam for help.</p>
<p>"Do you understand what I'm trying to say?" Brooke asked through her tears. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Of course I do, baby. But you could have told me that sooner and I would have told you what I'm about to tell you now. Brooke, your memories are only part of who you are. They could return tomorrow but you and I, we'll be OK. More importantly, YOU'LL be OK. Because it won't change who you've become. It won't be the same as the accident when you lost everything and didn't know anything. You are still basically the same wonderful person you were before the accident. The only difference is you're more confident in who you are, more straightforward, and a tad bit more quirky," Sam joked making Brooke giggle slightly.</p>
<p>"If your memories return, you'll still be all those things plus you'll have all the pieces of your old life back. Yes, you'll have to assimilate Brooke #1 with Brooke #2 but you won't lose any of either person that you are or have become. You'll be a stronger, whole person who I will still love with all my soul," Sam finished.</p>
<p>"Do you really believe that?" Brooke asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. You're the strongest person I know, Brooke. You've gotten this far. There's nothing that you can't get though," Sam promised. Brooke snuggled into Sam's arms feeling worlds lighter at hearing the brunette's loving words. She was quiet for a long time as she thought them over.</p>
<p>"I really am very sorry that I hit you," she whispered a half-hour later.</p>
<p>"I know you are," Sam whispered back. "Just promise me that you'll never do it again and I'll be OK."</p>
<p>"I swear that I will die before I EVER strike you again," Brooke vowed in all seriousness.</p>
<p>(God, I've hit her twice. How can she ever forgive me) Brooke cried silently. She felt Sam's arms tighten around her body.</p>
<p>"I forgive you, my love. My Brooke," Sam whispered in her ear as if reading her mind. Tears of relief ran down Brooke's face at hearing those words.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy. I don't deserve it, but thank you," she sniffled.</p>
<p>"Shhh, it's OK. Just try and get some sleep. I promise I'll still be right here for you when you wake up in the morning."</p>
