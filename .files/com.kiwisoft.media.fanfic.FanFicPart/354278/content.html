<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 28 Darkness -->

<P>"Move!" B’Elanna yelled as she sprinted toward the turbolift, dodging
crewmembers in the corridor. "Computer, hold turbolift on deck ten, main
Engineering." She rushed into the lift, her mind replaying the sound of Seven’s
screams. "Sickbay, emergency express," she ordered. The decks moved by too
slowly for the Klingon. She swore that she could see the decks inching past.
"Come on!" she yelled.</P><I>
<P>*"Command not recognized. Please restate request,"* </I>the computer
responded.</P>
<P>"Hurry up," B’Elanna said, although she knew the express command would get
her there as quickly as possible.</P><I>
<P>*"Turbolift speed already at maximum."*</P></I>
<P>B’Elanna pounded her fist against the door, willing it to move faster. She
remembered when she and Seven had crashed on Jusari Prime and how Seven had
snapped her own arm to get out of the restraints. Seven had shattered the bones
in her arm and she hadn’t so much as whimpered. B’Elanna shuddered as she
wondered what could possibly make her wife scream out in agony.</P>
<P>The lift stopped and B’Elanna ran toward sickbay. She could hear Seven
screaming, but not just screams of pain. Seven was terrified, devastated by the
sound of her voice. She was screaming "No!" over and over. B’Elanna ran into a
crewman and was knocked to floor on top of him. She quickly climbed back to her
feet and sprinted the last few meters to sickbay as she heard Seven let out a
wounded howl that almost tore B’Elanna’s heart out of her chest.</P>
<P>The door hissed open and B’Elanna saw Neelix flipping over some kind of
medical device and struggling with the Doctor. Behind them, Seven was arching
her back off of the biobed and screaming. B’Elanna jumped over the device and
went to Seven, taking her hand.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven gasped. "Stop him."</P>
<P>B’Elanna went into warrior mode and spun to face the two men. "Neelix! Let
the Doctor help her," she yelled.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said, her voice hoarse. "He wants to kill our baby."</P>
<P>"I am trying to save Seven’s life," the Doctor said as he got the upper hand
and tossed Neelix aside.</P>
<P>Neelix stumbled to his feet and slapped his comm badge. "Neelix to the
captain, I need you in sickbay now. Please, emergency transport." The Talaxian
was panting, exhausted by his struggle with the hologram. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna," the Doctor said disarmingly. "If I don’t take action right now,
Seven and the fetus are both going to die. If I act now, I can at least save
Seven."</P>
<P>Seven had B’Elanna’s hand in a death grip. "He wants to abort our daughter.
Do not let him…Promise me, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"What’s happening?" B’Elanna demanded as she looked down at Seven, noticing
her extended belly. </P>
<P>"Promise," Seven begged.</P>
<P>"I promise," B’Elanna said. She didn’t know what was going on, but she knew
that if she had been carrying the child, she would die before terminating the
baby. Her heart ached at what the promise might cost her. She could lose them
both. "Why aren’t you helping her?" B’Elanna demanded.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, you don’t understand." The Doctor moved to the biobed, scanning
Seven. </P>
<P>"Don’t trust him," Neelix said as he moved over to the biobed. </P>
<P>The Doctor let out a disgusted sigh. He would never injure Neelix, but his
enhanced holographic strength gave him a great advantage in any physical
confrontation, still, as a Doctor, he had little or no training in the art of
combat. </P>
<P>Neelix had used his scrappy size to keep the stronger Doctor at bay until
B’Elanna arrived.</P>
<P>All heads turned toward the sounds of a materialization. Captain Janeway
appeared with Tuvok at her side, armed with a compression riffle.</P>
<P>"Explain," Janeway ordered as she studied the stand off in front of her.</P>
<P>"Finally," the Doctor said. "Captain, get Neelix and Lieutenant Torres out of
my sickbay. Their delays may cost Seven her life."</P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna snarled. "This photonic psycho has flipped out yet again.
He is trying to force Seven to have an abortion against her wishes. It’s just
like when he used that Cardie hologram when I told him not to."</P>
<P>"The fetus has returned to the metabolic rate of Jusari Prime. If I don’t
abort it, Seven will die and so will the fetus," the Doctor summarized.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to the bridge, all clear." Tuvok lowered his weapon. </P><I>
<P>*"Understood,"*</I> Chakotay said over the comm. </P>
<P>Janeway moved to Seven and B’Elanna. "Do you want this?" she asked Seven.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she shook her head to emphasize her response.</P>
<P>Janeway spun and glared at the hologram. "Find another answer, Doctor."</P>
<P>"Captain," he whined. "I don’t even know what’s causing it. If it continues
at this rate, she could die in two to three hours."</P>
<P>"Three hours? Then why the Hell were you rushing to kill our child?" B’Elanna
bellowed.</P>
<P>"In case you hadn’t noticed, your wife is in agony," the Doctor snapped.
"With the metabolic rates out of sync, I can’t even give her anything for the
pain. Do you want her to suffer?" </P>
<P>"When did this start?" Janeway asked. "Could it be related to the
gravitational increase? Time and space are closely linked."</P>
<P>"It started well after we entered the increased gravity field," the Doctor
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Yeah, but the effects wouldn’t have been severe enough to notice for a few
hours," B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>"We can’t be sure," the Doctor said.</P>
<P>Tuvok stepped forward. "The increased gravity may have mirrored the
conditions causing the temporal differential on Jusari Prime. If the Borg
nanoprobes interpreted that as a return to the planet, they would try to
adjust."</P>
<P>"And just where did you all get your medical degrees?" the Doctor asked.</P>
<P>"Is it possible?" Janeway demanded. She looked over at Seven, her blonde hair
was matted to her face and she was covered in sweat. She was breathing
irregularly and clutching B’Elanna’s hand.</P>
<P>"Possible, but highly unlikely," the hologram said. "If that were the case,
Seven would be out of sync with the rest of us as well." He crossed his arms
over his chest. </P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she tried to roll onto her side. "My metabolism was
formed in regular space, as were my nanoprobes. I would not be forced out of
phase, in fact my nanoprobes would keep me in sync with the surrounding temporal
conditions."</P>
<P>"Why wouldn’t the baby’s nanoprobes be the same as yours?" the captain
asked.</P>
<P>"The neonatal nanoprobes were created on Jusari Prime, but they adjusted to
the temporal conditions when we left that planet." Seven had to stop to take
deep breaths, and B’Elanna stroked the exdrone’s face offering what comfort she
could. "The neonatal technology is separate from mine. I programmed the baby’s
nanoprobes to supersede my safety to keep our child healthy."</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked. "Why didn’t you tell me that?"</P>
<P>Janeway wasn’t interested in placing blame. They had a working theory and she
wasn’t going to watch Seven die. "Doctor, get Seven ready to travel. We have to
move her to the protected areas in Engineering. We’ve kept the gravity there as
close to normal as possible."</P>
<P>"I’m a Doctor, not a taxi service. I can’t haul my patients around like
luggage," he said indignantly.</P>
<P>"Can you help her here?" Janeway demanded. She looked at the device flipped
onto its side. She didn’t recognize it, then realized that it must be the device
to terminate the pregnancy. "Can you help her here <I>without</I> harming the
baby?" she corrected.</P>
<P>"All right," the Doctor said with a defeated tone.</P>
<P>"I do not want him touching me," Seven said between gasps.</P>
<P>"Seven," Kathryn said quietly. "You don’t have another option right now, but…
you’ll have B’Elanna with you every step of the way… and Tuvok." She nodded to
her Chief of Security. "If the Doctor attempts any procedure that you expressly
forbid, Tuvok will delete his matrix. We will reprogram a new EMH from the cache
files in the main computer."</P>
<P>"Understood, Captain," Tuvok said as he stepped closer to the Doctor.</P>
<P>"You can’t be serious?" The Doctor glared at Janeway.</P>
<P>"I can and I am," Janeway said as she stared him down. "Seven is the one
person on board who fought me to let you be fully sentient, but you seem to
bypass your ethical subroutines on a regular basis. We agreed that you would not
be countermanding any patient’s wishes after you used the Cardassian program to
save B’Elanna. I had my doubts about you after you were so willing to torture
Seven for Captain Ransom. We won’t ever have this conversation again."</P>
<P>"Yes, and if I hadn’t saved B’Elanna, Seven wouldn’t have a wife or a child,
now would she?" the hologram asked.</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna yelled. "Can we get my wife to the secured section of
Engineering and figure this out later?"</P>
<P>"Of course," the Doctor said as he gave the captain a wounded look. "I am
still the Chief Medical Officer, am I not?" he asked.</P>
<P>"For the moment," Janeway said. </P>
<P>The Doctor ignored the comment and began preparing Seven for her journey to
Engineering. The captain backed out of the way and leaned against the wall,
making sure her orders were followed. No one seemed to find it odd, in fact,
Neelix leaned against the wall next to her. His eyes never left the Doctor.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was focused on Seven and the way her face was contorted in pain. She
put her hand on Seven’s belly and winced when her wife flinched. "Did I hurt
you?" she asked as she started to pull her hand away.</P>
<P>"Leave it," Seven said in a rasping whisper. She put her hand over B’Elanna’s
and held it there.</P>
<P>"I’m staying with them, too," Neelix announced.</P>
<P>The captain nodded.</P>
<P>"If this doesn’t work, I won’t be able to do much to help her in
Engineering," the Doctor said as he brought out an anti-gravity stretcher. "I
can take the dermal regenerators, but trying to perform surgery down there isn’t
really an option if she insists on keeping the fetus."</P>
<P>"Neelix," B’Elanna leaned away from Seven and waved the Talaxian over. "I
need something from my quarters, can you get it for me?"</P>
<P>"Of course, B’Elanna." He moved closer and she whispered her request into his
fuzzy ear. He eased back, confused, then nodded. "I’ll be back as quickly as I
can," he said, then turned and hurried out. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>They moved Seven quickly through the ship, her pain increasing as the strain
on her body magnified. While they relocated her, Tuvok went over a data padd
with the gravitational information. He determined that there had already been
five times when the ship had been under the gravitational stresses that would
cause a metabolic spike. Most were for under an hour at a time, short,
unintentional incursions into the wakes of the dark matter whirlpools. The fact
that the earlier spikes were short made them difficult to diagnose, but the fact
that the child’s metabolism returned to normal was a good sign. The Doctor’s
scans revealed that Seven’s pregnancy had advanced over a month in the last two
days. Given the temporal differential on Jusari Prime, that mean Seven had been
exposed to the increased gravity for just over four hours. Each hour with the
metabolic spike in effect advanced the pregnancy an entire week.</P>
<P>They got to Engineering and all eyes were on them. It wasn’t everyday a Borg
drone was being carted around by a Captain, Chief Engineer, Chief of Security,
and the Chief Medical Officer.</P>
<P>"Vorik," B’Elanna yelled as they came into main Engineering. "Take the
engines off line and put the ship onto emergency energy conservation mode. We’ll
have to rely on the impulse engines to supply power for the entire ship."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," the Vulcan said as he began the engine shut down sequence.</P>
<P>"Hang on, love," B’Elanna whispered. She leaned down next to Seven. "We’re
almost there. Just hang on." The anti-gravity table hovered between the four,
although the Doctor seemed as if he were not part of the small group. </P>
<P>He continued scanning Seven, his frown increasing with each new finding.</P>
<P>"Hurry up," B’Elanna yelled. Until they had the warp core shut down, they
couldn’t safely move Seven into the protected area of the engine room. The
Doctor wanted to position Seven as close to the warp core as possible. They had
managed to keep the warp core on line so that the ship had full power. Seven’s
condition changed that, although the ship wasn’t in any immediate danger. They
would be able to restart the engines as soon as they cleared the dark matter
field and moved Seven back to sickbay or her alcove.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Vorik stated calmly. "There is an established shut down
sequence that must be followed."</P>
<P>"I know that," the Klingon said, trying to remember that ripping his head off
wouldn’t help Seven.</P>
<P>Janeway stepped forward. "Vorik, use the emergency shut down sequence, and by
pass the overload section and the start up routine. We haven’t been using the
engines for propulsion, so we can leave that out."</P>
<P>He looked at her skeptically, but it was her ship. "Aye, Captain."</P>
<P>Four minutes later they had Seven in position and waited while the Doctor
scanned her again. He let out a long sigh, a completely unnecessary act since he
didn’t even need to breathe.</P>
<P>"The metabolism is almost normal," he said. "Almost."</P>
<P>"What does that mean?" B’Elanna asked. She still had Seven’s hand in hers,
but the exdrone was getting weaker and was barely keeping her eyes open. </P>
<P>"It means that if she can replenish her energy reserves she may be all right,
but I can’t be sure." The Doctor took out a dermal regenerator and a laser
scalpel and cut Seven’s biosuit in half and then began healing the large bruises
around her belly. The skin had stretched so quickly that even her Borg
nanoprobes couldn’t keep the tissue from being traumatized.</P>
<P>"Oh, Seven," B’Elanna whispered when she saw the damage. No wonder she had
been screaming so loudly. The bruises on the outside were from the internal
tearing of her muscles.</P>
<P>Neelix came into the engine room, his arms full. He was wrestling the fur
comforter from B’Elanna and Seven’s bed along with B’Elanna’s jacket.
"B’Elanna," he whispered as he came closer. "Where would you like these?"</P>
<P>"Give them to me," B’Elanna said as she took them and put them on one of the
nearby consoles. She carefully took off her uniform tunic, plucking off the comm
badge first, and then slid on her leather jacket. She felt the comforting weight
of the leather wrap around her, a physical manifestation of Seven’s love for
her. B’Elanna closed her eyes and fought to keep from crying. Seven had spent
weeks making the jacket, getting it just right, sitting in front of the
fireplace at night stitching. The Klingon settled it against her body, enjoying
the feel, the smell, and the rich chocolate brown color. She sighed and put her
comm badge onto her chest.</P>
<P>"It gorgeous," Kathryn said quietly. She moved over to B’Elanna and ran her
hand over the collar, and then straightened the jacket into place and helped
B’Elanna zip it. "How did you find this on that planet?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna squeezed her eyes shut and her lip trembled. "Seven made it for
me."</P>
<P>Kathryn pulled B’Elanna to her chest and held her. "It’s beautiful. I had no
idea she was so skilled," she whispered into B’Elanna’s ear. "I’m so sorry."</P>
<P>B’Elanna let Kathryn hold her and remembered when she had her first
experience with the Barge of the Dead. She had awakened and clung to Kathryn
like a lost child, and the captain had cradled her, cooed to her until she was
all right. B’Elanna knew if Seven didn’t pull through, she would never be all
right again. </P>
<P>"I’m sorry, Captain." B’Elanna sniffled and pulled back.</P>
<P>"Don’t be. Remember," Kathryn said. "I told you to come to me if you needed
anything."</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said. She turned and took the fur and carried it to
Seven.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?" the Doctor demanded. "This isn’t a barn. I mean, it’s
not a sickbay either, but this is too much."</P>
<P>"Shut up," B’Elanna said as she pushed past him and tucked the folded fur
under Seven’s head as a pillow.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes flickered open. "Is the baby all right?" She looked up at
B’Elanna, exhaustion making it difficult to keep her deep blue eyes open. She
inhaled, smiling when the familiar scent of home filled her nostrils. She turned
and rubbed her cheek against the fur. "I love that color on you," Seven said
when she looked back at B’Elanna’s jacket and then her eyes drifted shut.</P>
<P>The Doctor scanned Seven, taking extra time near her belly. "Amazingly, there
is no damage to the fetus…right now. I can’t make any guarantees about the next
few hours. But, I will say that I am amazed by the resiliency of the neonatal
nanoprobes. They have maintained the integrity of the placenta and umbilical
cord, and the fetus has suffered no ill effects."</P>
<P>"How is Seven?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>His eyes darkened. "She hasn’t fared so well."</P>
<P>"What does that mean, Doctor?" Kathryn asked as she rubbed her temples. She
could see the anguish in B’Elanna’s eyes and wanted him to get to the point.</P>
<P>"As it stands, she is approximately eighteen weeks into the gestation, we can
take the fetus safely at twenty four weeks," the hologram explained.</P>
<P>"What do you mean, take?" B’Elanna asked. She was still angry at the
hologram, and didn’t trust him for one second.</P>
<P>"The fetus can be raised in an incubator at twenty four weeks, although the
longer it can be carried, the better." He cleared his throat. "The problem is, I
don’t know if Seven’s body can tolerate the pregnancy for another six weeks. I
don’t know if she can tolerate all she’s been through so far."</P>
<P>"I will carry my child to term," Seven said from the anti-gravity stretcher.
"As soon as we are clear of the gravitational river, I will regenerate. That
will help my body heal."</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor said, "How much longer until we clear the gravitational
river?"</P>
<P>"Maybe…twelve hours," Kathryn said after a few calculations in her head.</P>
<P>His expression was crestfallen, and he slowly shook his head.</P>
<P>"What?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"She doesn’t have that long," the Doctor explained. </P>
