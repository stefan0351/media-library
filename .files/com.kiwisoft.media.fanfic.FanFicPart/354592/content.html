<!-- Girls Movie Night \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>It had taken Willow nearly an hour to coax Tara out of
the bathroom. When she had finally succeeded, Willow
had firmly eyed both Buffy and Anya warning them both
not to mention what had happened in the kitchen. Anya
just flicked her hand at the two wiccan’s in annoyance
and went back to watching her movie. Buffy just
smiled.</p>

<p>Everyone started to settle themselves down once again.
Tara opted to squish herself as far into the side of
the couch as she could, while Willow sat next to her.
Buffy, who had been sitting at the other end of the
couch, decided to slide off and sit on the floor,
while Anya scrunched into the sleeping bag on the
floor. For the rest of the movie, all four of them sat
in silence, munching on popcorn and M&M's. </p>

<p>Well, Willow watched Tara more than the movie. She was
kind of worried. All she could hear Tara saying as she
tried to get her girlfriend to come out of the locked
bathroom was, "I can't believe this... I can't believe
this..." over and over again. Willow felt guilty of
course. Because, like always... and there were more
times then just this one instant in recent months, she
was the one who had instigated such events. Tara
really never complained. Well, she usually protested,
but than she usually gave into whatever Willow
wanted... and that's what was bothering Willow the
most right now. Did she push Tara into these things? </p>

<p>Willow kept trying to get some answers from Tara's
eyes, but the blonde would not look at her. She simply
stared, uninterested, at the TV. She wouldn't even
take any popcorn when Willow offered her the bowl.
Willow knew she was embarrassed. Tara always got
embarrassed. When they had finally acknowledged their
feelings for one another, Tara seemed to get
embarrassed even when they were holding hands. Willow,
on the other hand, was simply oblivious to everything
that went on around them. All she wanted was to be
with Tara, to touch… to touch her all the time. </p>

<p>It was hard for Tara at first to get use to Willow’s
constant affections. She was so uncomfortable with the
physical stuff, especially in public. It wasn't like
she hid how she felt for Willow. Anyone with his or
her eyes opened only had to look at Tara to realize
it. The blonde had the ability to tell an entire
story, or a simple emotion, with expressions… with her
eyes. Every time she looked at Willow, the redhead
melted and she would instinctively reach out for the
blonde. Willow knew she was loved. </p>

<p>In a sense, Willow had tried to convince herself that
all the public 'stuff' they had done as of late was
her way of helping Tara get over the uncomfortableness
of their relationship. At least that's what she tried
to tell herself right before she'd get a mischievous
little glint in her eye as she pushed Tara into the
bathroom stall of the Bronze... or into the bathroom
at Giles apartment. Yeah, she did manage to convince
herself that she was just 'helping' Tara that's for
sure! </p>

<p>But now... well the reality of that ‘help’ was
painfully staring her in the face. Tara seemed to be
trying to bury herself even deeper into the far end of
the couch, not wanting anyone, especially Willow, to
touch her. That’s when Willow knew she’d gone too far.</p>

<p>
Sighing defeated she got up. "I'm going to get another
drink. Anyone want another?" She posed to the group
waiting for a response. Only Anya and Buffy shook
their heads no, so she sulked into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Buffy watched as Willow left, snuck a look out of the
corner of her eye at Tara, and decided she'd better go
talk to her friend. Try to fix this. Half of it was
her fault anyway! So she got up and followed the
redhead into the kitchen.</p>

<p>The first thing Buffy saw when she entered the kitchen
was Willow was softly banging her head against the
outside of the refrigerator door. Buffy quickly went
over to her and made her stop. "Will," the redhead
looked at her, burgeoning tears in her eyes. "Lets sit
down." Buffy said, leading them both to the kitchen
stools. </p>

<p>Willow didn't look at Buffy. She simply stared at her
empty glass. Both of her hands wrapped tightly around
the plastic Whinny the Pooh cup Dawn had gotten with a
happy meal... that was, before she decided she was
'too' big and stopped getting happy meals. Buffy
unclenched one of Willow's hands and held it.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry Will."</p>

<p>"Oh, no Buffy it's all my fault..." Willow faltered
slightly.</p>

<p>"Absolutely not Will! Anya and I..." Buffy's voice
trailed off momentarily, "... we should have never...
ya know... watched." The slayer squirmed in her chair
uncomfortably. </p>

<p>"Oh Buffy." Willow nearly sobbed and leaned into her
friend for a hug. "I think I've really messed things
up. I mean really really."</p>

<p>Both girls hugged each other tighter and Buffy let
Willow cry on her shoulder. After a moment, she pulled
her friend away so she could look into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I doubt that Wills. I mean you and Tara, you’re like,
like... soul mates or something." Shaking her head and
frowning Buffy continued, "I don't know. But I do know
that the two of you are perfect together... you know
that." She smiled up at green eyes that seemed to
light up slightly. Wiping away a tear, "You are you
know? I look at the two of you together sometimes and
my heart aches. I don't know if I'll ever be that
close to someone else ever again... that much love." </p>

<p>"But Riley..."</p>

<p>Buffy just shook her head, "No," she said almost
defeated, "No, Riley and I, we... I don't know what we
have, but it's not like what you and Tara have.  Will.
Nothing’s like that." </p>

<p>This time it was Willow who wiped a lone tear from her
friends’ cheek. "You will Buffy. Maybe not with Riley,
but you will." </p>

<p>Buffy smiled in gratitude. "Why do you think you've
messed it up Will? I mean Tara's still here isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"Yeah I know, but she won't even look at me Buffy."
Willow pouted as she pulled away from her friend and
got up to refill her drink. "Not to mention let me
touch her." She added haphazardly.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe she figures you've touched her enough for
one night."</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Willow was about to throw an ice cube at her
'friend', when Buffy threw up her hands up mollified. </p>

<p>"Whoa there slugger, only kidding."</p>

<p>"It's not funny Buffy, I really... it's like... you
don't understand." Willow finally settled on, not
really sure how to explain things to Buffy. </p>

<p>Although her friend had accepted her relationship with
Tara, Willow knew Buffy was still a little
uncomfortable with the idea. And the redhead wasn’t
quite sure Buffy was ready to hear about some things
related to her relationship with Tara. </p>

<p>A myriad of emotions passed over the redheads face as
she looked at her friend. As if sensing what was
holing the Willow back, Buffy reached out her hand to
her. Willow took it and sat back down.</p>

<p>"Willow, I know I haven't been the bestest bud I
should have been since you and Tara... well, since you
and Tara, but I want to be there for you. I want you
to know you can tell me anything." Buffy tried to
emphasis the last word so she didn't have to explain
any further. The redhead’s eyes light up in
understanding. </p>

<p>"Are you sure Buffy? Because, because I really need
someone to talk to about me and Tara stuff
sometimes... I mean, REALLY." </p>

<p>Buffy stared at her wide eyed friend waiting in
anticipation, "Yes, Will I'm sure."</p>

<p>A weight seemed to lift from Willow's shoulders and
she settled in next to Buffy. "It's like… I don't know
what it is Buffy. I've never been able to figure it
all out. And it's not the magic thing either. I mean I
thought it was at first, the magic. I thought that was
why I felt the way I did about Tara. So drawn to
her... so... um..." Willow looked at Buffy out of the
corner of her eye wondering if her friend was really
ready to hear all this. Buffy nodded telling Willow to
continue. "I wanted her bad Buffy. Like real bad! I
even did something that I'm not to proud of." Suddenly
worried, Willow glanced towards the rest of the house
making sure no one was listening than lowered her
voice, "you can't tell anyone Buffy, no one." The
redhead looked at her friend slightly afraid.</p>

<p>"Will, what did you do?" She questioned. Of course she
would never tell.</p>

<p>"I... I... I kinda looked. Um, peaked, at Tara. Kinda
when she didn't know it... like she was asleep."
Willow looked away ashamed, but Buffy didn't quite
understand and Willow could tell. </p>

<p>"Um Buffy, when Tara and I met we were friends, just
friends. But we started seeing a lot of each other
and, um," Willow adjusted her position on the chair
and looked directed into Buffy’s eyes, "do you
remember the night I said I was in the chem lab all
night... by myself?" Willow waited a moment for the
memory to come to Buffy, when she saw the recognition
in her friends hazel eyes, she continued. "I wasn't in
the chem lab, and I wasn't by myself. I was with Tara.
We were doing spells all night and that's when things
started to change. I mean, I started to feel something
for her, and I started to ya know, think about her."
Ducking her head in embarrassment Willow continued,
"Kinda naughty things about her." </p>

<p>Buffy smiled. That was the silly goofy Wills she
remembered so well. </p>

<p>"We kept spending more and more time together doing
spells and stuff. And after a while, being with Tara
all the time, I-I-I just couldn't take it any more
Buffy!" Willow said acerbated. "All I could think of
was touching her and feeling her, and seeing her
and... and..." It took a moment for Willow to calm her
babble down. "And I felt like if I didn't see her,
touch her, I'd explode. But I was so afraid Buffy. I
didn’t want to feel… feel like that for a girl.”
Willow paused only long enough to flash one of her
puppy dog sad looks in Buffy’s direction. </p>

<p>“I knew how Tara felt, which, now that I think about
what I did it seems so incredibly stupid. All I had to
do was ask and I'm sure Tara would have let me touch
her anywhere I wanted." A large grin graced the
redhead’s lips, but quickly faded again. Frowning she
continued, "I, we were doing spells all night and got
tired. So I stayed over at Tara's, and while she was
sleeping, I kind of... ya know... peeked." The last
word squeaked out of Willow's lips.</p>

<p>"Peeked? I don't get it Willow."</p>

<p>Willow sighed resigned. She knew she'd have to tell
Buffy the entire story. Sometimes her friend really
could be quite dense!</p>

<p>“Will just tell me what you did, okay.” Buffy nodded
towards Willow to continue.</p>

<p>“It was that night, you know, when you got into the
Initiative and we were suppose to be at the Bronze
together, but you showed up like an hour late.” Willow
looked at Buffy sideways and the slayer tried not to
feel too guilty about that night. “Well, I went to see
Tara. I mean, she wanted me to come over but I had
kind of brushed her off to go to the Bronze for the
Scooby thing.” </p>

<p>Okay, now Buffy did feel guilty. </p>

<p>“So I just showed up in the middle of the night, even
though I knew she had been hurt by what I said
earlier… so I just show up and she had the most
beautiful wonderful smile on her face and I just
wanted to melt. We did a bunch of spells that night
and were pretty exhausted, so Tara had suggested I
stay the night.” Willow stopped just long enough to
catch her breath. “So anyway, we were lying in bed and
she was just so close… right there and I… and I…”
Willow’s voice trailed off into the silence of the
kitchen. </p>

<p>After a moment, the frown that had creased across
Willow’s forehead subsided a bit. </p>

<p>“I don’t know Buffy. I mean I never felt like that
before.” Willow seemed to settle into her memories as
Buffy simply waited for her to continue again. </p>

<p>“I loved Oz. I loved being with him. And he was so
sweet and gentle, but there’s something about Tara… I
feel… it’s so strong Buffy.” The words whispered out
of the redhead’s lips. “I just wanted so much to touch
her.” Willow said finally with a heavy exhausted sigh.</p>

<p>
Buffy shifted in the hard wooden stool and took
Willow’s hand in her own. “What did you do Willow?”
She urged gently. </p>

<p>Willow stared off into nothing as she recounted that
night.</p>

<p>< * Flashback – The ‘I’ in Team * ></p>

<p>Tara’s dorm room was so dark that it took a few
minutes before Willow’s eyes adjusted. When they did,
she let them drift slowly around marveling at
everything she saw. All the little knick-knacks and
pictures, every small detail unraveled a bit more of
the mystery that the blonde still was to Willow. Time
ticked and Willow simply enjoyed the quiet heat from
the body next to hers. Unsure of how long she had been
gazing at Tara’s belongings, a sudden rhythmic
breathing drew Willow’s attention. She swallowed in
apprehension. All the emotions, all the desires began
to swirl uncontrolled inside of her as she turned to
face Tara.</p>

<p>The blonde was lying on her back. Her hair fanned out
on her pillow, her head tilting slightly to the right.
Willow licked her dry lips as her eyes lingered
downward. Tara’s hands where resting one on top of the
other on her stomach, one hand gripping the cover that
barely reached her waist. Willow’s eyes made another
slow pass back up the blonde’s body taking in more
minute details. Like the fact that Tara’s long exposed
neck looked so smooth in the moonlight. And how the
oversized jersey shirt she wore to bed had one of the
top buttons missing. And how, because of that missing
button, the edges of the shirt drifted down to her
shoulders exposing a vast expanse of flesh. </p>

<p>Willow’s neck began to ache, so she flipped onto her
right side so she could continue to simply watch the
blonde sleep. Tara was so still, calm. Just like when
she’s awake. Willow mused to herself, but her
wanderings were suddenly cut short when Tara shifted.
The blonde darted a leg in Willow’s direction, her
knee bending, as she stroked her foot on the redhead’s
calf. </p>

<p>Willow froze, her eyes fluttered shut as Tara’s leg
slipped between her own.  She tried desperately to
suppress the moan begging to be released. After a
moment, Tara calmed again, and Willow began to as
well. </p>

<p>But the darkness, and the heat of Tara’s leg between
her own infused Willow with a desire that would not go
unquenched. Without even thinking, she reached a shaky
hand out for the large red button that rested between
Tara’s breasts. The plastic bit slipping from its
confine all too easily, and Willow looked back up to
make sure Tara was still asleep. </p>

<p>Knowing she’d gone to far to stop this, stop herself,
Willow’s breathing increased even though she was
desperately trying to remain quiet. Carefully she
pulled back one side of the jersey, her eyes widening
in amazement as one of Tara’s breasts was revealed to
her. </p>

<p>For the longest time Willow simply looked, biting her
lip. And while her mind babbled silently, too
distracted to stop her body, her hand hovered towards
the blonde’s exposed breast. A single finger grazed
downward over Tara’s nipple as the flesh stiffened.</p>

<p>“Willow.” The word whispered through hazy desire into
the still room.</p>

<p>Willow froze in absolute horror thinking for sure that
Tara had woken and would be kicking her out of the
room at any moment. Willow remained incredibly still
as her heart pound in her chest. When what seemed like
an eternity passed and she was still on the bed,
instead of kicked on the floor, Willow cautiously
looked back up at Tara. </p>

<p>The blonde was still sound asleep.</p>

<p>Hurriedly Willow buttoned the jersey back up, drew the
covers back up to Tara’s waist, flipped over on her
other side and burred her face in her hands. Mortified
at what she had done.</p>

<p>< * End Flashback * ></p>

<p>Willow tried to gain some control over her body, which
seemed to be doing things that she really didn’t want
it to be doing sitting next to her best friend, as she
finished her story. “Um… I thought for sure she’d wake
up, but she never did. And than I realized what I had
done and I got all nervous and guilty and… I mean… I
like molested her Buffy!”</p>

<p>Willow squeaked that last sentence out quickly and sat
quietly not looking at her friend. She really didn’t
know what she was expecting. Maybe someone to tell her
what a bad person she was for doing something so
naughty. Or possibly someone to tell her what she did
was perfectly normal. That wanting someone… well a
girl, that bad, as bad as she had wanted Tara, was
okay. Maybe she just wanted everything to be okay
again. </p>

<p>Buffy quickly tried to gather her thoughts. The first
one that went through her mind was ‘wow.’ She had
never realized what a horn dog her best friend was.
The second thought was sadness. Regret. She hated
herself for not being there to help Willow through all
this in the first place. But she couldn’t fix the
past, only the present… the now. </p>

<p>“Willow, if you want me to tell you what you did to
Tara was okay, well I can’t. Only Tara can tell you
that.” Buffy saw her friend’s face turned downward,
crestfallen. “But if you want me to tell you that what
you were feeling back then, what your feeling now, is
alright, then I will. It _so_ is Willow. It’s
perfectly all right for you to love Tara, to… want her
as much as you do.” Buffy seemed to be at a loss for
what to say next, but she tried to just continue
onward, “I don’t know Willow. I don’t know what to
tell you. I love you. You’re my bestest best friend.
You take care of me and look after me, and you’ve
always been there for me even when I’m not always
there for you, and all I want is for you to be happy.
And Tara makes you happy. That’s like SO obvious. And…
and Tara’s such a wonderful girl Will. I don’t know.”
Buffy kind of threw her hands up in confusion. “Just
love her Will, and tell her and… and everything will
be okay.”</p>

<p>Okay, so maybe it wasn’t Buffy’s finest best friend
moment, but something she said must have made sense to
Willow because the girl’s green eyes lit up like
spotlights and she smiled widely. They just stared at
each other for what seemed like the longest time. </p>

<p>It was Willow who finally spoke up. Her voice was firm
and reassured. “Thanks Buffy.” It seems so simple, but
it meant everything. Willow’s smile took on a more
mischievous glow, “ssoooo, you don’t mind if we have
these little talks more often then do you? I mean, ya
know, comparing stuff… and stuff?” </p>

<p>The redhead’s green eyes sparkled and Buffy’s widened,
than frowned, ‘what have I gotten myself into,’ she
thought to herself. But before either could speak
another voice chimed in.</p>

<p>“Um…” The soft low voice was unmistakable and Willow
immediately turned towards the kitchen entrance.
“A-a-are you going to come back inside? Anya wants to
start another movie.” Tara just looked down at the
floor solemnly. </p>

<p>“Tara!” Willow squeaked and rushed over to her.
Instinctively she grabbed for the blonde girl’s hand
but caught herself and held back. Turning a pleading
look towards Buffy.</p>

<p>“I’ll go in and see what’s the what with Anya.” Buffy
got up and headed out of the kitchen. “You two need to
talk.” She patted Willow on the shoulder and left.</p>

<p>An awkward silence hung between the two lovers. Tara
still looking at the floor, and Willow wanting more
than anything for the blonde to look up at her.
“Tara?” Willow finally questioned softly. </p>

<p>Tara lifted her head slowly, as if lifting it too fast
would cause the headache she had to knock her off
balance. As sad blue eyes finally meet hopeful green
eyes, Willow ventured cautiously and took Tara’s hand
in her own. When the blonde did not protest or pull
away, Willow tightened her grip. “I’m so sorry Tara.
Please…” Willow tried hard to choke down the tears
that were threatening to overwhelm her. She couldn’t
loose Tara… she just couldn’t. “I… I… sorry, so
sorry.” Was all she could think to say and she
repeated it over and over again, softly.</p>

<p>Tara reached her free hand up and gently cupped
Willow’s tear stained check. “Willow.” It was soft and
filled with love and it melted the redhead’s heart…
like hearing Tara whisper her name always did. </p>

<p>Willow threw herself into Tara’s arms. “Please don’t
leave me. I couldn’t bear it if you left me.” Willow
managed to say through her increased weeping, grabbing
onto Tara with all her might.</p>

<p>“Oh Willow.” The blonde sighed and wrapped her arms
tightly around her beloved. “I would never leave you.
Not now, not ever. I don’t think I could survive
without you.”</p>

<p>Willow pulled away and looked into her girlfriends’
eyes. “Promise?” She sounded like a scared child, but
she really didn’t care… because in a way, that’s
exactly how she felt.</p>

<p>Tara smiled softly, placed a single kiss on Willow
check and leaned towards her ear, “Promise.” </p>

<p>They stood embracing each other for some time until
they both had gained some of their composure. Willow
mustered up some courage and finally spoke, “I’m so
sorry Tara. I know you don’t… you… I know I kind of
for….” A gentle finger on her lips stopped her.</p>

<p>“No Willow, you don’t make me do anything I don’t want
to do. I want you… need you to know, understand that.
It’s just, um, s-s-sometimes…” Tara didn’t know how to
say it.</p>

<p>“No, your right, I-I I kinda get a little crazed
sometimes,” the redhead smiled playfully, “but Tara,”
she brought the girl’s hand to her cheek and rubbed it
gently against her face. “Sometimes I just need you so
much it scares me and I forget about everything,
everyone, and I just want you… now, or then, or… well
most of the time.”</p>

<p>Tara chuckled softly, understanding. “I know Willow,
and I want you too, all the time. But some things are
hard…” she trailed off leaving the words unsaid. Words
they had already discussed. Pasts they had already
unearthed to one another. Willow shook her head in
understanding.</p>

<p>“I promise I’ll try to control myself more.”
Unfortunately it came out of her mouth a little to
gleefully and both girls laughed. </p>

<p>“Okay.” Was all Tara could manage before the screaming
from the living room began to assault their ears.</p>
