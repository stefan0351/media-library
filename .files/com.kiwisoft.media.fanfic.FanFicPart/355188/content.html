<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Forward Motion -->

<p>Lily arrived at the Julian mansion and knocked tentatively on
the door. A few minutes later it opened and a butler looked down at her. After
examining Lily closely, he frowned. </p>
<p>"We're not interested in whatever you're selling today," he
said rudely and moved to close the door. Lily opened her mouth in shock and used
her arms to stop the door from closing. </p>
<p>"Excuse me?" she started, getting pissed. The butler glared at
her. </p>
<p>"Take your `Save the Latin war orphan' rant somewhere else,
young lady before I call the authorities," the butler warned. Lily saw a film of
red fall over her vision and stuck her foot in the door. </p>
<p>"Listen you arrogant, stuck-up, snobbish, close-minded,
British asshole," she began, "I'm not here selling anything, I'm here to see
Nicole. Now either get her for me or tell me where she is or I'm going to come
through this door and leave Adidas tracks on your face. Understand, or do I need
to go over it in Spanish?" The butler arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Judging from the way you're dressed I doubt that you're a
friend of Miss Nicole's, if she even has friends. But if you are that explains
the attitude," he said dryly. Lily glared and prepared to charge. "One moment
and I'll get her for you," he said as he stepped back into the house. Lily stood
back and waited and tried to regain control of her breathing. Boy was she
pissed. She hated being dismissed based on appearance alone. It was one of the
things she'd disliked about Nicole in the first place. Nicole had dismissed her
based on the fact that she didn't look or dress like the `in' crowd. But now it
appeared that that assumption was incorrect. (I have got to stop assuming so
much) Lily thought with a sigh. </p>
<p>"Lily?" Nicole's voice coming from behind her made Lily jump.
Nicole stood there looking kind of frightened. </p>
<p>"Hey Nic, I think we need to talk," Lily said. Nic winced. </p>
<p>"You're not gonna slap me or anything, are you? I mean, I
deserve it and everything but, can I have a warning first, just to prepare?"
Lily almost laughed. Almost but Nicole looked so lost it killed the urge.
</p>
<p>"No, Nic, I'm not going to slap you, honest," Nicole seemed to
relax. Lily held up her Walkman. "Good song," she said. Nic shrugged.
</p>
<p>"I thought so," she agreed. </p>
<p>"Doesn't strike me as your type of music though," Lily said as
they started to walk the grounds. Lily had to admit the grounds of the mansion
were beautiful, immaculate even. But not homey, it was obviously for show, not
for children to play in. Lily wondered how lonely and sad Nic's childhood was. </p>
<p>"I listen to whatever sounds good," Nic responded. </p>
<p>"Is that how you really feel, the song, I mean?" </p>
<p>"Yeah, trapped sometimes, like Superman is in his part. I was
hoping you'd understand what I was trying to say," Nicole explained. Lily
nodded. </p>
<p>"I did. I'm sorry you feel that way," Lily apologized. Nic
shrugged. </p>
<p>"Don't be, you didn't put me there. I did, my family did.
Anyway, so, what do you want to talk about, besides the song I mean?" she asked
although she knew the answer. </p>
<p>"Why did you kiss me?" Lily asked point blank. (Gotta love the
girl's bluntness) Nicole thought with a smile. </p>
<p>"Because I like you," Nicole responded just as directly. (Why
lie?) Lily stopped in her tracks. </p>
<p>"You like me?" she asked in shock. Nicole stopped walking as
well and faced the stunned brunette. </p>
<p>"Yes, why does that shock you? That I have emotions at all or
that they're directed at you?" </p>
<p>"Both," Lily answered honestly. Nic nodded. (OK, that was
expected) Nic thought. </p>
<p>"Well, I have emotions, I've just been very well trained on
how to hide them deep inside. If no one knows you have them then no one can hurt
you with them," she explained to the still stunned Latina. "And I have felt
something for you for a long time I just didn't know what to do with it."
</p>
<p>"Why now? Why now when you know I have feelings for Sam?" Lily
asked quietly. Nicole shrugged. </p>
<p>"I'm tired of playing my part, Lily. And I know you care for
Sam and I know I can never BE Sam. Not that I want to," she trailed off about to
insult Sam out of habit but caught the dirty look from her companion and thought
better of it. </p>
<p>"So I can never be Sam. I'm Nicole, that much is clear but
Lily, Sam and Brooke are presumably `together'. We can assume that unless you
wanna call and ask?" Lily shook her head `no'. She was pretty sure they were
`together' as well. That much she was prepared to assume. </p>
<p>"So you're chances with Sam are practically nil and I'm not
saying that to upset you, honest. It's a fact, hon. An ugly but true fact. But
why should you be left alone in the shadows when there's someone who cares for
you as well?" </p>
<p>"You?" Lily asked with a raised eyebrow and a bit of a snide
tone. Nicole looked away from the incredulous expression on Lily's face and
sighed. </p>
<p>"You know what? Nevermind, you're right, I don't have a heart
and I'll just end up hurting you anyway. Later, Lily," Nicole said as she walked
away. Lily shook her head and wondered when the conversation turned south. </p>
<p>"Hey wait, I didn't mean it like that," she said as she caught
up to Nicole. She was surprised to find her crying. "Whoa, Nic, don't cry," she
said flabbergasted. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I cry, I have feelings and I really really like you,"
Nicole confessed as she collapsed onto the lawn. Lily sat down next to her, her
head swimming with shock and confusion at everything she was hearing.
</p>
<p>"Look, Nic, this is a lot to take in and I didn't mean what I
said to sound the way it did. You're Nicole Julian who never says two words to
me unless it's to insult my activistism, my heritage, or me and now you turn
around and confess to harboring deep meaningful feelings for me. I'm a little
stunned." </p>
<p>"Yeah, ah, sorry," Nic said through her tears. Lily shook her
head. </p>
<p>"Don't be. Boy is this whole thing getting convoluted," she
joked earning a small smile from Nicole. </p>
<p>"Lily loves Sam; Sam loves Brooke; Brooke loves Sam; Nicole
loves Lily. Yeah, that sounds convoluted to me," Nicole agreed wiping away her
tears. Lily reached up and brushed away a few Nicole missed. Nicole sat shock
still as Lily's hand brushed her cheek. Lily looked at her strangely.
</p>
<p>"You love me?" Lily gasped. Nicole replayed her last few
sentences in her head and physically winced. She put her hand over her mouth and
smacked herself in the forehead with the other while Lily watched slightly
amused at the display. </p>
<p>"Me and my big mouth," she mumbled though her hand. (Crap, no
going back now) Nicole lamented. "Well, I've already said it. You're about the
only thing I do love, Lily," she admitted quietly. "I think without you, I'd
have forgotten what that emotion was." Lily was thankful she was sitting because
she probably would have fallen over at hearing that whispered confession.
</p>
<p>"You're sinking the boat," Lily pointed out gently, leaning
her head on Nicole's shoulder. Nicole sighed. </p>
<p>"I think I'm all ready on the bottom and running out of
breathable air, hon," she responded leaning her head on top of Lily's.
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You need a shower," Brooke said as she nuzzled Sam's neck as
they both still lay in Sam's bed. </p>
<p>"Gee, thanks," Sam scoffed as she played with Brooke's hair. </p>
<p>"You smell like stale beer, cigarettes and sleep. Doesn't help
that you slept in your clothes," Brooke added as she pulled away to look into
Sam's face. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"You could have taken me out of them last night, you know,"
she said. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Thought about it, didn't trust myself," Sam's eyebrows shot
up. </p>
<p>"You would have taken advantage of a poor, drunken, young
virgin? Shame on you, you harlot," she laughed. Brooke sighed but it turned into
a laugh. </p>
<p>"But I didn't, give me a little credit. Besides, I doubt you
would have protested." Sam thought a minute. </p>
<p>"Probably not," she agreed. </p>
<p>"Come on, though. Go shower," Brooke insisted as she
reluctantly rolled out of the warm bed and Sam's embrace. Sam watched her go and
sighed. She sat up and swung her feet over the edge of the bed. Brooke reached
over and helped her to her feet and into a passionate kiss. Sam wrapped her arms
around the taller form. </p>
<p>"I could so get used to this," Sam whispered as she leaned her
forehead against Brooke's. </p>
<p>"I hope so because I can too," she whispered back. Sam smiled
a million watt smile and turned towards the bathroom. She extended her hand
towards Brooke. </p>
<p>"Join me?" Brooke's eyebrows made a valiant attempt at escape
off the top of her head. </p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Brooke asked her voice coming out as a squeak.
Sam laughed again. </p>
<p>"For the shower," Sam said. "Nothing more if that's all you
want. Just some soap and shampoo. Water, rinse, repeat. You know what they say,
`shower with a friend'." The smile on Sam's face was downright devilish and
Brooke couldn't help but mimic it, it was infectious as well. </p>
<p>"I don't know, Sam," Brooke said. Sam fixed her face in her
famous pout. "Oh, no, not the pout, Sam. That's not playing fair." Sam deepened
the pout. Brooke threw her hands in the air. "You win, just turn off the Sam
McPherson pout please," she begged. Sam laughed as Brooke walked over and kissed
her again. </p>
<p>"If I knew it had such a positive effect I would have used the
pout sooner and more often," Sam said when the kiss ended. Brooke shook her
head. </p>
<p>"Please don't. You're utterly irresistable when you do that.
It could lead to trouble," Brooke warned. Sam pulled her towards the bathroom. </p>
<p>"Now, about that shower." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"What do we do now?" Lily asked as she sat next to Nicole at a
table in one of the numerous rooms in the Julian mansion. Like the grounds, it
was beautiful and immaculate but reminded Lily more of a museum than a home.
Nicole had not too politely informed Jeeves, or whatever his name was, that Lily
was welcome and he'd better treat her with more respect or he'd find himself on
a one-way trip back home and into the unemployment line. </p>
<p>"Haven't a clue, Lil. I was hoping you did," Nicole sighed.
Lily shook her head. She was still trying to wrap her mind around the fact that
Nicole loved her. </p>
<p>"Nope," Lily groaned as she put her head back. </p>
<p>"Look, I know you love Sam and it's simple, I'm not Sam,"
Nicole started, making Lily pick up her head to look at her. "But I'm willing to
wait, same as you were." Lily thought a minute. </p>
<p>"Are you saying you're willing to `play second fiddle to my
feelings for Sam McPherson'?" she asked, paraphrasing Sam's words from the
newspaper office. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"While I would never willingly want to play second fiddle to
Spam, er, Sam for anything, for you Lily, I'd do almost anything," Nicole
confessed. </p>
<p>"Almost?" </p>
<p>"Well, I have my standards and I'm willing to go for faux fur
if it's well done," Nic protested. Lily laughed earning her a dirty look from
Nicole. "I'm glad you find me funny." </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I just thought it was going to be something
earthshattering and it wasn't. It was funny," Lily was still laughing and Nic
couldn't help but smile. She loved Lily's laugh. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I'm over here baring what soul I have and you're
laughing it up. Thanks," Nic joked half-heartedly. Lily looked at her seriously. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I know you took a big risk telling me, trust me
I've been there myself. I know how scary it can be. You're very brave, Nicole,"
Lily said gently. Nicole blushed. </p>
<p>"That still doesn't tell us where we're going from here," she
pointed out. Lily shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, it doesn't. But hopefully forward," Lily looked intently
at Nicole. "I know that Sam is out of my reach. And you're not Sam but I don't
want to risk you being some sort of `rebound' thing. That would only end up
hurting you." Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"Take the leap, Lily," Nicole asked. "I'm willing to if you
are. Why should either of us be alone?" </p>
<p>"We shouldn't. But I don't want to screw this up," Lily said
quietly. </p>
<p>"If you never take the chance, you never know what might have
been," Nicole told her. Lily had to admit, the blonde had a point. She thought
about the possibilities for a few minutes. Nicole had mentioned earlier that
they were endless. And they were. Was she brave enough to take this chance? </p>
<p>"OK, Nic," Lily said quietly. "You want me, I'm yours." Nic's
face lit up for a second but then dimmed. </p>
<p>"It's not like that, Lily. Do you feel ANYTHING for me? Other
than hatred and disgust, that is?" </p>
<p>"I don't hate you, Nic, especially since I've gotten to know
the real you, beyond the façade. And I enjoyed the kiss," she admitted shyly.
"If there wasn't something there, I wouldn't have." Nic smiled again.
</p>
<p>"Can I kiss you again? For real this time?" Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"I'd like that," she whispered. Nicole leaned over and pressed
her lips against Lily's. This kiss lasted longer and wasn't as tentative as the
one in the park. It seemed to go on forever until they parted breathless.
</p>
<p>"Whoa," they both panted in unison. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"The whole object of `showering with a friend' is to conserve
water, Sam, not use up the entire state of California's supply," Brooke
chastized as she toweled her hair. </p>
<p>"Sorry, I was?distracted," Sam murmured into Brooke's ear from
behind. Brooke shivered. </p>
<p>"Really? By what?" Brooke asked innocently. </p>
<p>"A beautiful naked blonde beauty in the shower with me," Sam
informed her. </p>
<p>"Brad Pitt was in the shower with you?" Sam glared at her with
a raised eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Har har, no Brooke McQueen was. And damn, girlfriend has a
body on her!" Sam let out a whistle and Brooke blushed. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, you aren't so bad yourself," Brooke said in
return. Sam shrugged and launched a kissing assault. </p>
<p>"Sam, if you keep that up we won't be able to stop," Brooke
warned as Sam backed her up against the sink. </p>
<p>"And that's a bad thing because?" Sam asked burying her face
in Brooke's neck. </p>
<p>"Because I want to take this slow, Sam. Going all the way in
one day strikes me as a bad choice," she said. Sam sighed. On some level, she
knew Brooke was right. It was just her body wasn't in the mood to listen.
</p>
<p>"Ok, slow, got it," Sam panted pulling away from Brooke.
"Clothes, I need to put clothes on," she declared. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"Well, that'll suck from my point of view but I see your
point. Clothes are a very good idea," Brooke agreed as she headed into her room.
She met up with a fully clothed Sam a few minutes later. </p>
<p>"So where do we go from here?" Sam asked with her hands in her
pockets. Brooke thought a minute. </p>
<p>"Forward, I hope," she answered. </p>
<p>"But where is that?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Ultimately, I don't know, Sam. But for now, I do know that
I'm hungry. Wanna grab some food?" Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Sounds like a good short term plan," Sam agreed. Brooke
reached out and took her hand. </p>
<p>"We'll figure it out as we go Sam. For now, enjoy the moment,"
Brooke advised with a smile. Sam smiled back. </p>
<p>"As long as you're here with me, I think I can do that." </p>
