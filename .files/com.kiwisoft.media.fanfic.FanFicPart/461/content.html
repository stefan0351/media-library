<!-- Il Loro: Il Bruciando Ballo, Il Ballo Burrascoso \ Act I: New passions, burning brightly, for everyone to see. -->

<p>It was the night of the Annual Captain's Ball and almost everyone was in attendance.  There were two skeleton crews for the evening: one to care for the ship for the first three hours of the ball, another for the last three.  The volunteers had their reasons, though mostly it was due to the double rations they would receive.  However, other than the people who would serve in those crews, everyone else came dressed to the nines.  After all, it was the event of the year, every year for a crew lost far from home.</p>

		<p>Captain Janeway insisted that every year everyone enjoy himself or herself.  She would spare no rations on the food and libations, and the ball itself was held in the largest holodeck aboard.  Each year she took great pains to reproduce a different ballroom, but they all had two things in common: they were extraordinarily opulent, and were a replica of a famous ballroom from a Federation planet where at least one member of the crew had been born.  This year she had made many people happy, and others nostalgic, by recreating a site from Bajor.</p>

		<p>The party was great, a celebration to remember.  Many couples had made announcements that night to great rounds of applause.  Many others simply reached out to those they may not know so well, in search of new friendships, and possible companionship.  Nevertheless the night was nearing its end.  Some had already left while others, like the ship's pilot and his best friend, probably would not leave until the holoprogram was shut down.  Those men were currently standing with the Captain and Chakotay involved in a deep discussion about a Commander that all of them had had as an instructor back at the Academy.  The EMH stood on the periphery of the group amused by the looks of horror that each person displayed during their part of the tale, but the Chief Engineer who stood only a meter away seemed to be lost in thought.</p>

		<p>A sudden change in music drew everyone's attention to the holographic orchestra on the other side of the room.  It would be an understatement to say that all of the command crew was shocked by their resident Borg's appearance on the edge of the dance floor just in front of the musicians.  It was not lost on any of them that she was not in her usual attire.  Considering her outfit covered her more completely than her biosuits, it seemed strange to almost all of the people along the edge of the floor that she would appear even more sensual than before.  The exceptions to this were her captain, the Doctor and her chosen dance partner for the evening.  Each of these people had seen the young woman dressed similarly to how she was now- and each knew that the drone had stolen their breath the first time they had seen her this way.  It wasn't a surprise to any of the three now to feel his or her heart flutter at the sight of Seven as she stepped up onto the floor, waiting for someone.  As Seven of Nine stared across the floor in the direction of the command crew, only one knew what was she doing.</p>

		<p>The Captain felt her heart ache, with her obviously unrequited love of her friend.  She knew her cause was lost a long time ago, and never even revealed her feelings to anyone.  The Doctor felt differently.  He was convinced that eventually he would have his chance; that Seven would come to see how he loved her and would return his love some day.  He began to step up onto the floor only a moment after the blonde's intended partner.</p>

		<p>The Chief Engineer of Voyager, B'Elanna Torres, who was seemingly always at war with the woman across the floor,  knew why Seven came dressed as she was, why she requested the music she had.  To say that the EMH was shocked when the young Klingon-Human hybrid spoke gently to him, informing him that this was her dance, would not begin to cover the Doctor's feelings.  To say that the Captain was concerned for Seven was not enough to describe her fears.</p>

		<p>Many people were afraid of what was about to happen, but only two knew it had been planned long ago, as a reward, a payment for a wager B'Elanna lost to Seven.</p>

		<p>Yet, to say that the two women knew what would happen that night would be very wrong.</p>

		<p>The music seemed to call out the drone's beauty and grace as she stepped all the way out onto the floor, dancing alone.  It was a very demonstrative dance only a few of the crew could identify as the Tango.  However, even those who did not recognize the old terran dance could not help being impressed by what Seven was doing.  She finally stopped in the middle of the floor facing the engineer, her very posture challenging the hybrid to answer her call.</p>

		<p>When B'Elanna glided onto the floor, moving more smoothly than many of the crew would have ever believed that she could, she began a perfect counterpoint to the Borg's movements.  She was perfectly in tune to the music and radiated a scorching sensuality.  Through her well-timed movements she eventually flowed across the floor to stop and stare briefly into Seven's eyes.  Then she abruptly spun away from the blonde, leaving her back to the young woman and her arms crossed dramatically over her chest.</p>

		<p>Some people watching felt a certain amount of fear and wonder when Seven straightened and began a slow approach towards B'Elanna's back.  There was almost a collective gasp as she grabbed the hybrid by the wrist and spun her just as the music changed.  The tempo gathered speed and so did the couple's movements, although it was obvious that at that point the former Borg was firmly in control.  She moved with B'Elanna in ways that most of the crew knew that they themselves could not accomplish... especially at the tempo the orchestra was keeping.  The women paced around the floor together held so tightly in each other's arms that there was no light to be seen between them.</p>

		<p>At times the engineer would seem to throw away the attentions of the Borg, only to be recaptured.  Other times, she seemed to command Seven, telling the blonde with eyes and body what she wanted and the Borg simply obeyed.  At one point the music hastened to a point where few believed it was possible that these two could keep pace even though they saw it with their own eyes.  The two women commanded the entire dance floor, taking in its circumference only to end where they started.</p>

		<p>Then, as the music slowed again, the tall blonde grabbed one of B'Elanna's legs and literally dragged the smaller woman back to the middle of the dance floor, holding B'Elanna tightly to her body the entire time.  Through the trip the two stared into the other's eyes seemingly oblivious to the world around them.  B'Elanna straightened, slowly sliding her leg down the back of Seven's leg wantonly, grinding forward into the other woman more tightly.  If it had been anyone else upon the stage, the crewmembers around them would have thought that each movement was the most sensual they had ever seen publicly displayed.  Yet, with these two, hardly anyone could believe it was anything other than an act.</p>

		<p>Suddenly the drone had detached her leg from B'Elanna's and almost too quickly for the eye to see she had dipped the other woman.  B'Elanna was left hanging, straight as a board, barely off the floor.  Seven was holding her, one leg out and parallel to B'Elanna, the other knee bent deeply, holding her own torso just above her dance partner.  They were close to one another, so close that they could have kissed.  Their movements no longer seemed to be choreographed by the music, instead seeming to flow from some other source.  Everyone was silently stunned when Seven closed the small distance between their lips, sealing the dip with a kiss.</p>

		<p>Just as suddenly as the dip began, it was over and the two stood momentarily plastered tightly together.  The music ended and Seven stepped back from B'Elanna, but did not let her go.  Instead, the former drone blatantly caressed the hybrid's arms, stepping forward as she caught the smaller woman's hands, and then kissed each finger tenderly.  The two women still seemed unaware of the fact that they were surrounded by their crewmates as they stared into each other's eyes and spoke so softly a few words only meant for them.</p>

		<p>It took a few moments for those present to collectively shake off their astonishment, but even as the women still stared at each other applause erupted around them.  Not even thirty seconds later though both women appeared as their normal selves.  It was as if you could see anger cover B'Elanna's body and cold indifference enshrouding Seven.  The blonde dropped B'Elanna's hands and abruptly turned and marched away, leaving the holodeck altogether.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna stood there for a minute more seemingly planted to the spot.  Captain Janeway was brave enough to step onto the floor and approach the engineer.  It was at that point that some of those present formed the idea that this was Janeway's doing all along; just another way to try to make the two warring women get along.  However, most people knew better.  The engineering crew knew nobody could force B'Elanna to dance with Seven, let alone kiss her.  The command crew knew that Janeway would never go that far to get the two to make up.  More than a few others were observant enough over the years and wise enough to know that this was no act forced upon the women.</p>

		<p>The Captain got within a meter of B'Elanna and softly spoke her name.  She was astounded when the young woman turned her head only partially towards her commanding officer because what Janeway saw then was something she had rarely seen.  There were tears welling in the hybrid's eyes.  However, B'Elanna was not going to let her Captain comfort her.  She hissed too quietly for anyone but Janeway to hear: "Stay out of this Kathryn."  Then B'Elanna made her own exit from the Ball.</p>

		<p>Janeway stood there only a moment, her heart rending in two for the women who had just fled.  She could feel what had happened had been real.  Further, her years of experience, her observation of life and love let her know something she had never before conceived, yet now believed with every fiber of her being.  She now knew that the two women were destined lovers, that all their fights and anger were only a front.  They had covered up their love so deeply that even they had never had any idea... until now.  However a discovery in front of the entire crew, misunderstandings, years of anger and finally new embarrassment... these things were not going to make it easy for the women to accept their newfound love.  Only seconds passed as Janeway digested this.  She turned back to where her remaining command crew stood and proceeded with damage control.</p>

		<p>She disallowed Tom Paris from chasing after his former lover... she knew that the young woman needed time alone.  Instead she told him and all those around her to seek out others to bring out to the dance floor.  She implored them all to find a way to end the evening on another note... to distract those present at least a bit from this latest twist in the struggle of Hansen vs. Torres.</p>

		<p>As they obeyed their loving Captain, she herself invited a young man from biometrics out onto the floor.  She could contain her feelings well under her command mask.  She had years of experience making light and convincing conversation in situations like these.  She knew how to make anyone around her feel the very best about themselves and their lot in life, having had years of practice in two quadrants of the galaxy.  Only the woman behind the command mask was out of her reach at the moment.  That woman ached not only for her own lost chance, but also for two young women she knew were hurting more.</p>
