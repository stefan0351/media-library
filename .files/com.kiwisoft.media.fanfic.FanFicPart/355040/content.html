<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 8 -->

<p>When Buffy woke up this time, she had no idea where she was. There was an IV in her hand and the walls around her were all white.</p>
<p>'A hospital. I'm in the fucking hospital.' She realized.</p>
<p>She didn't have time to think much else before Giles rushed over to her with Willow, Oz, Xander, and even Cordy by his side.</p>
<p>"B-Buffy? Are you alright?" He asked his voice dripping with concern.</p>
<p>She was fine, why was everybody here with her and nobody with Faith? She wondered.</p>
<p>"What? I-I'm fine."</p>
<p>Everyone gave her a strange look.</p>
<p>"Well, that may be what your mind is telling you but your body seems to think the contrary. You have been un-conscious for 2 days."</p>
<p>Buffy couldn't belive her ears. It felt like only moments ago she was in Faith's room...Faith oh god Faith! Was this how she would feel if she woke up? Buffy hoped not. Her head was pounding and everything hurt.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's thanks to Oz that we even thought to look for you here."</p>
<p>"Oz?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You see, as an 18 year old there is no legal obligation to inform anyone of your whereabouts or condition. The hospital never called us."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm fine now. Did they tell you what was wrong with me?"</p>
<p>"No..."</p>
<p>"I told them." Oz spoke up.</p>
<p>"Geeze Buffy, how could you do something so stupid?" Cordelia said, ignoring tact as usual.</p>
<p>"Buffy...Buffy if something was wrong why didn't you talk to me? To any of us? We would have helped you! We love you!" Willow said.</p>
<p>Through all of this Joyce was suspiciously absent. Finally Buffy decided to ask.</p>
<p>"Where's my mom?"</p>
<p>"We...we never notified her. We wanted to see if you would allow us to help you through this without involving her. She is already concerned about you and..."</p>
<p>Giles lowered his voice...</p>
<p>"Slaying, we don't want her to worry about this."</p>
<p>Buffy shut her eyes tight. He was still thinking about slaying. She'd quit that job hadn't she? What did it take to earn an early retirement? She had died once already. She'd defeated the master. If she was the vampire slayer, than wouldn't that mean her job was done?</p>
<p>"Buffy, you have to stop all this."</p>
<p>Giles said making a wide sweeping motion with his arms.</p>
<p>God how could this happen? None of it was supposed to go this far. She just wanted something to ease the pain, to take her mind off things. Had she really...did she really od?</p>
<p>"Buffy...we just want to help you. We want to be here for you."</p>
<p>"Sure you do Xander. Just like you wanted to be there for me when Angelus was around? Just like you wanted to be there for me when you found out he was back?"</p>
<p>Xander recoiled in pain.</p>
<p>"Buff...I"</p>
<p>"Buff nothing. You will always be there for me. There for me to save, there for me to get in my way, there to turn on me."</p>
<p>The anger in her voice had caused all of them to back up a step, both in shock and pain. What had come over their Buffy? What was going on with her?</p>
<p>Buffy had had quite enough of this, she removed the IV from her arm and got out of the bed.</p>
<p>"Where are my clothes?" She asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Here. I brought you these." Willow said, being as kind as possible, and passing her a bag of things.</p>
<p>Buffy looked in the bag and disgust played across her face. It was her old clothes. Clothes she would have worn when she was still in highschool. Pre-grad Buffy clothes.</p>
<p>"Where are the clothes I came in here in?" She demanded.</p>
<p>"Buffy, I don't think you are in any shape to be getting up."</p>
<p>"I don't care what you think Giles. I don't care much about anything anymore. Remember????"</p>
<p>Giles looked down at the floor, his feelings clearly hurt.</p>
<p>Buffy saw the other clothes in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>"Get the hell out of here. All of you."</p>
<p>As the initial shock ended they all slowly left the room.</p>
<p>Buffy went over to the corner and put the clothes on.</p>
<p>Using her steeltoes, or Faith's steeltoes, she kicked the window sending glass shards flying in every direction. Buffy jumped out and ran across the hospital lawn towards the parking lot.</p>
<p>'The jeeps gotta be here somewhere' She thought.</p>
<p>The gang ran back into Buffy's room and towards the shattered window just in time to see Buffy get into her jeep and speed off.</p>
<p>"What are we going to do? Giles?" Willow asked, concerned.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I just don't know."</p>
<p>"And we thought Faith was bad." Oz said in his cool manner.</p>
<p>"Yeah, imagine a drug-addicted slayer! Totally unpredictable, and unreliable. Much like Faith without drugs..."</p>
<p>"Xander, that's enough!" Giles shouted.</p>
<p>He thought of Buffy like a daughter, and he wasn't going to let this happen to her without a fight.</p>
<p align="center">------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>All Buffy knew was that her stash was gone and she needed more. Who cared if they all knew? She was the slayer how could the stop her anyways?</p>
<p>Want, take, have or something to that effect wasn't it?</p>
<p>As she headed towards the dirty apartment once again she cranked her radio.</p>
<p>Billy Idol came on.</p>
<p>Buffy wondered why he always made her think of Spike.</p>
<p>Before long she pulled up to the appartment and went inside, this time she kicked the door open without even bothering to knock.</p>
<p>"Hey! What the hell..." The guy shouted.</p>
<p>"You again?" He asked, and under his breath he muttered "I wish all my clients took to it like this bitch."</p>
<p>Buffy heard him, but didn't care. She wanted more. She wanted something better.</p>
<p>"I need something else."</p>
<p>The guy laughed a disgusting laugh.</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>He brought the briefcase over to her and laid it on the table. He took out 3 hypodermic needles and a bag with a brownish powder..</p>
<p>"Take the powder, mix it with some water, find a vein, the ones near the wrists work best, stick it in and inject."</p>
<p>Buffy was aprehensive. Memories of her 18th birthday flooded her. But through the haze of addiction she couldn't let it stop her.</p>
<p>"How much."</p>
<p>"150."</p>
<p>"What? Tell me your kidding mother fucker!"</p>
<p>The guy was scared of Buffy. He had faced alot of people in his life, alot of dangerous people and none had scared him like this girl could.</p>
<p>"Ok-ok, 100 but that's it. A guy has to make a living you know."</p>
<p>She smirked at him and through money over. It was all she had left.</p>
<p>She took the needles and the new powder and left.</p>
<p align="center">------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Giles wanted to check on Faith. He was already at the hospital anyways.</p>
<p>Xander and Cordy had left. Oz had to go to band practice and Willow...Willow was still at the hospital.</p>
<p>"Willow...umm, I'm going to see Faith. Would you like to come?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I want to see how she's doing. I think Buffy may be having problems because of what went on with Faith."</p>
<p>Giles silently agreed, and they headed towards Faith's room.</p>
<p>There was a doctor standing just outside her door reading some charts.</p>
<p>"E-excuse me, what's going on here? The patient...is she..."</p>
<p>"She's awake." The doctor said and smiled at them.</p>
