<p><b>Chapter 2 </b></p>
<p>Lilly stood morosely in the hallway of her new school, watching the students mingling about and passing by. She'd hoped Michael at least would stick by her side in this unfamiliar environment, but he had seen a group of cheerleaders and gone after them like a stray puppy. She wondered if the Juniors here at Beauford County High were as immature as he. Lilly briefly hoped she'd see Miley here; she hadn't been able to get the girl out of her head since their meeting at the diner on Friday. The Truscotts had spent the weekend getting situated in their new house, though Lilly had multiple times considered sneaking out to go to the diner and hopefully catch another glimpse of her new friend. At least the furniture was getting delivered today and both Lilly and Michael had volunteered to start school instead of helping.</p>
<p>Lilly sighed and looked down at the class schedule in her hand. It wouldn't be too hard finding her classes in this place; her high school in Malibu had been five times the size of this. Nevertheless, she resented her parents for making her move with just over a month left in the school year. Another note held her locker number and combination and Lilly decided to go find that first. Someone stepped in her way and she looked up.</p>
<p>"Lilly, right?" The shaggy-haired boy suddenly in front of her grinned confidently, pointing both his index fingers at her.</p>
<p>Lilly narrowed her eyes. "How do you know my name?"</p>
<p>He laughed. "You're the only new girl in school since probably beginning of freshman year. Everyone knows who you are." Lilly rolled her eyes in annoyance. First Miley had known which house they were moving into, and now this kid was acting like they were best of friends.</p>
<p>He grinned again and Lilly decided she found the way he did it to be somewhat annoying. "I'm Oliver, but you can call me Smokin' Oaken."</p>
<p>"Uh, no thanks?"</p>
<p>His face fell somewhat, as if he'd fully expected her to be mesmerized by him. Oliver shrugged and leaned closer to look at her class schedule. "We got a lot of the same classes…I could show you around?"</p>
<p>He sounded a lot less egotistically since she'd shot him down and Lilly shrugged. He seemed nice enough and it couldn't hurt to have someone showing her the ropes. Of course, Lilly wished it were Miley doing so, but despite her best wishes she had not seen the girl. She nodded and Oliver smiled, a lot less annoying this time, and began walking next to her. He was going slow, as if he wanted to prolong their time together or show everyone he was talking to the new girl. Probably both, Lilly decided.</p>
<p>"So, Lilly, have you met anyone else here?" asked Oliver, trying to surreptitiously check out the blonde. She was pretty hot and he knew he had to make his move quickly before the jocks and pretty boys saw her. Though she hadn't seemed too interested in his lines earlier.</p>
<p>"Other than you, I met some girl named Miley the day we moved here. I haven't really been out much; we're still moving in," explained Lilly, wondering how she could stop him from checking her out.</p>
<p>Oliver suddenly stopped, his eyes widening almost comically. Lilly stopped as well, looking at him in confusion. The other students were merely walking around them and the crowd seemed to be thinning out somewhat. "Miley? You don't mean Miley Stewart, do you? I don't think there <b>is</b> another Miley."</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged, wondering why his voice sounded almost panicky. "I don't know her last name, we only talked for a few minutes. Brunette, blue eyes, pretty, probably around our age."</p>
<p>He made almost a strangled sound and grabbed Lilly's forearm. "You <b>talked</b> to her?"</p>
<p>"Uh…" Lilly didn't know what to say to that, unsure why the boy seemed so freaked out. Miley hadn't seemed horrible or anything, quite the opposite really. "Was I not supposed to?"</p>
<p>Oliver shook his head and looked around them, then ran a hand through his hair. "Look, you can't tell <b>anyone</b> here you talked to her, got that? Oh no, and now <b>I </b>talked to <b>you</b> after you talked to <b>her</b>." He seemed to descend further and further into madness, before rubbing a hand across his forehead. He began walking again abruptly and Lilly followed, completely confused.</p>
<p>Oliver grasped the classroom door handle. "I don't think it applies to you…I mean, you didn't <b>know</b>, right? That would be really unfair. Maybe we'll be fine…" He seemed to be talking mostly to himself and Lilly followed him into the classroom and took a seat next to Oliver in the back.</p>
<p>The boy turned to her again, his eyes intense. "Still, don't tell anyone." He turned away again and Lilly wanted to ask what the hell was going on and why he was having a panic attack over the fact she'd talked to Miley, when the teacher walked in. The blonde hardly listened all lesson, the only thing on her mind the burning question: What was wrong with Miley?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>The sweat was running in rivulets down Lilly's back and she grimaced at how sticky she felt. Sick of the hospital-like cleaning her mother had begun at the house, Lilly had grabbed her skateboard and decided to explore the neighborhood a bit. Now she remembered why that was a bad idea. In fact, as she looked around, she realized she had no idea where she even was. Crowley Corners was tiny population wise, but there were plenty of farms and ranches that took up quite a bit of land and since everything sort of looked the same to her, navigation was going to be a problem.</p>
<p>The streets were basically empty, even though it was early afternoon and she rolled along slowly. Some familiar buildings came into view and Lilly stepped off her board, kicking it into her hand. The diner, or the 'The Die-ner' as Michael had taken to calling it after his two-day bout with gastrointestinal issues, was just across the road. Lilly was tempted to go inside, for two reasons. One, the air conditioning was quite tempting and she really wanted to cool off, and two, Miley. She hadn't seen the other girl in five days, not since their meeting on Lilly's first day and, after Oliver's near meltdown, Lilly had merely become more intrigued. Oliver hadn't offered her any answers, but Lilly had found out Miley did not go to school with them. He didn't know where Miley went and had made it quite clear to Lilly he did not want to know.</p>
<p>Lilly walked closer to the shoddy building, debating with herself. If Miley wasn't in there, she'd be stuck in the creepy diner alone. On the other hand, if Miley was in there and she didn't go in, she'd be mad at herself. Heaving a heavy sigh, Lilly wished for luck and entered the diner. Multiple pairs of eyes turned to look at her, but quickly lost interest. The same creepy guys were sitting at the bar, though Lilly did not pay them much mind. Her eyes scanned the bar for Miley and disappointment flooded through her when she didn't see the girl. She was about to turn and leave, when she spotted the brunette in the far booth to her right. Lilly grinned and walked over.</p>
<p>She slid into the booth across from Miley, trying to keep her excitement from showing too much. Miley was deeply engrossed in her shredded napkin mountain and looked up when Lilly sat down. Miley seemed quite surprised to see her at first, but it was as if she caught herself and smiled, eyes sparkling. "Lilly from California. Fancy meeting you here."</p>
<p>"Miley Ray, my Southern hospitality tour guide," said Lilly with a grin, unable to dial down the excitement flooding through her system. She did not understand why this girl was so exhilarating. Oliver's multiple warnings to stay away from Miley rang in her ears and she ignored them. She pointed at the mess in front of Miley. "You've got a real issue with napkins, huh?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh…" Miley grinned almost shyly, looking down at her pile. She shrugged. "Nervous habit, I guess. My hands just get fidgety when they have nothing to do."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, understanding fully well. She, too, had a lot of nervous energy, the main reason she used to surf and skateboard all the time. Miley noticed her skateboard and motioned at it. "Are you any good?"</p>
<p>"Good enough, I guess." Lilly shrugged, not one to extol her own virtues. She'd won multiple skating competitions back in California, though it was unlikely she'd find anything similar in this place. "Do you skate?"</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "Nah, that's an accident waiting to happen." When she looked up to meet Lilly's eyes, the blonde could see that sadness in them again and wondered what it was about. Miley was intriguing, but she wondered why the kids at her school seemed to think she was dangerous to talk to. Maybe she was in the mafia or something. Lilly snorted out loud at the thought.</p>
<p>Miley gave her a weird look. "What's so funny?"</p>
<p>"You're not in the mafia, are you?" asked Lilly, not sure where her idiocy was coming from. Miley seemed not to mind regardless, merely giving her an odd look.</p>
<p>"Not that I know of, no."</p>
<p>A waitress came up to their table and Lilly looked up. The woman sighed somewhat exasperatedly as she saw Miley's pile of napkin. "Miley, could you please stop destroying the inventory?" The girl smiled sheepishly, not looking at the woman. "Now, does your friend want to order something?"</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes widened slightly; she hadn't even thought about the fact that she'd come into a business, where it was customary to order things. Her plan hadn't really gone beyond finding out if Miley was there. "Oh…uh…I didn't really bring any money…"</p>
<p>Miley met Lilly's eyes across from her. "Don't worry about it."</p>
<p>Lilly wanted to protest; she knew she very likely got a lot more in allowance than most kids in Crowley Corners and she didn't want Miley to waste what money she had. But the other girl seemed not to care and looked at the waitress, "She'll have a Coke. Oh, and can we get some fries?"</p>
<p>"You want a refill, too, hun?" asked the woman, pointing at Miley's empty glass.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am." Miley grinned toothily at the waitress and Lilly thought for the first time the girl's face seemed completely uninhibited. It made her wonder what Miley was trying to hide from her and whether she should've taken Oliver's warning to heart. Once the waitress left, Lilly looked at the other girl.</p>
<p>"Thanks, but you didn't have to do that, you know," said Lilly, feeling a bit guilty that here this girl was being nothing but nice to her and she was wondering if Miley was evil incarnate.</p>
<p>Miley rested both her elbows on the table and leaned closer, conspiratorially. "Well, I kinda got a secret."</p>
<p>Lilly's eyebrows rose almost imperceptibly. Was Miley finally going to tell her what was going on? Would this solve the mystery? She leaned closer herself, spellbound as she met Miley's eyes. They were so incredibly blue she thought she might drown. She urged her friend to continue with a nod of her head. They were so close now, maybe only a foot separated them and Lilly held her breath. Her heart was thundering already, though she couldn't say whether it was from being so close to beautiful Miley or from being so close to finding out the big mystery.</p>
<p>Miley looked completely serious, but then her façade broke and she smirked. "I eat for free."</p>
<p>Lilly tried not to let the disappointment show and leaned back slightly. She had not been expecting that, hadn't seen how Miley was clearly playing around. She cursed herself for even falling into whatever trap Oliver had set. Maybe they were all trying to mess with her, but Miley didn't seem like she would do that. She shook her head, trying to think of something to say. She didn't want Miley to know what she'd really been thinking. "I've never seen you eat."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Yeah, well, the food sucks."</p>
<p>Lilly felt like a complete fool and tried to shake the last vestiges of nervousness. She'd been so sure Miley was going to tell her a big, dark secret. Lilly did not like feeling like she was in the dark. Miley, though, had been nothing but nice and playful and Lilly resolved herself to forget whatever stupid stories anyone else told her. She leaned closer again.</p>
<p>"Free food, huh? So, you <b>are</b> in the mafia?"</p>
<p>"Something like that. My mom works here," explained Miley. Things made a lot more sense now to Lilly; she hadn't seen many teenaged girls hanging out in diners for fun.</p>
<p>The waitress from before came back with their drinks and fries and Lilly looked at her more closely. Brunette hair, blue eyes – she wondered if this was Miley's mom. The waitress set everything in front of them and brushed her hand briefly across the top of Miley's head, "Here you go, sweet pea." Yeah, definitely her mother, Lilly thought.</p>
<p>Miley looked up. "Thanks. Hey momma, I want you to meet my new friend, Lilly. She's from California. Lilly, this is my mom."</p>
<p>Lilly had always hated meeting parents and somehow this was a thousand times more awkward. She nevertheless said 'hello' and 'ma'am' like the good girl she was. She realized with a start that if her mother worked at a diner, it would be the absolute last place she'd ever be seen and she most certainly wouldn't introduce new or old friends to the woman while in that diner's uniform. She wondered why Miley didn't care.</p>
<p>"A new friend, huh? Well, it's nice to meet you, Lilly," said the woman and though she was smiling, Lilly could tell it wasn't completely sincere. She seemed apprehensive, mistrusting and Lilly almost felt like she was being given a once-over. She walked away after a few moments and Lilly turned to Miley, to see if anything on her face showed how odd her mother's behavior had been.</p>
<p>Miley was busy squirting huge amounts of Tabasco sauce onto the plate of fries. She smothered one completely, before sticking it in her mouth, the look on her face almost ecstatic. Lilly grinned, "Do you need a moment?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing quite like Tabasco, Lilly. I put it on just about everything. Drives my mom wild." More Tabasco-drenched fries made it into her mouth.</p>
<p>Lilly reached for the plate and picked up her own soaked fries. She'd never really been a fan of hot foods, but she wasn't going to pass up sharing fries with her new friend. She hesitantly put them in her mouth and her eyes widened at the taste. Despite Miley's earlier statement about the food and Lilly's apprehension, the fries were amazing. She quickly ate a few more and together they'd nearly emptied the whole plate within minutes. Miley was watching her, smiling.</p>
<p>"So, you like my fries and Tabasco?"</p>
<p>"You mean 'Tabasco and fries', right? But I have to admit, they were amazing," said Lilly, stealing the last fry off the plate.</p>
<p>Miley folded her arms, face serious. "I think we'll be good friends, Lilly from California."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what to say to that, but deep inside, she felt it, too. She had never met anyone like Miley before and she was dying to find out everything about this girl. She smiled and Miley returned it in full. Lilly couldn't remember the last time she'd felt so silly. One look at the clock, however, told her she wouldn't have another time like this for a while if she didn't make it home within the next half hour. Unfortunately, she still had no idea how she'd gotten where she was. Miley noticed the look on her face.</p>
<p>"You gotta go?" Her voice was almost sad and it made Lilly feel good knowing she wasn't the only one feeling this way.</p>
<p>"Mom's got very strict dinner times that must be adhered to under penalty of severe grounding. Now if only I can find my way back home," she said morosely. She wasn't quite sure whether she was fishing for help from Miley. She didn't want to leave her just yet.</p>
<p>Miley seemed unsure, like she knew exactly what Lilly was asking for and either didn't want to, or couldn't meet her request. Lilly suddenly felt stupid again. Miley shrugged. "I could maybe walk you home. It's not that far. I have to ask my mom, though…she doesn't really want me going out into town."</p>
<p>Lilly briefly looked out the windows, but there was literally nothing around. "Is there some crime problem in Crowley I don't know about?"</p>
<p>Maybe Miley was merely making excuses for not wanting to go with her, but when she looked at the girl's face, she almost seemed nervous. Lilly had no intentions of making her uncomfortable or getting the girl in trouble with her mother. She was just about to say she could find her own way back, when Miley bit her lower lip and slid out of the booth, "I'll go ask her."</p>
<p>It was several minutes before she returned and though she smiled at Lilly as if in triumph, the blonde could tell she wasn't happy. Lilly wondered what her mother had said to her and, more importantly, why her teenaged daughter couldn't walk the streets of Middle-of-Nowhere, TN by herself. Nevertheless, she grabbed her skateboard and followed Miley to the door – she wasn't about to turn down help she clearly needed.</p>
<p>As they got to the door, Lilly thought she felt eyes on her. She turned her head. Miley's mom was standing behind the bar, watching her with an unreadable expression. Lilly wondered what was going on. She did not acknowledge the woman, instead following Miley out into the oppressive heat.</p>
