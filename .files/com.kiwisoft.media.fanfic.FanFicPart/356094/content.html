<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 16 -->

<p>The next morning B'Elanna discovered to her chagrin that although she could remove her chest bindings herself, when it came to putting them back on she was unable to sufficiently tighten the cloth around her chest to adequately hide her breasts.  It was with a healthy dose of embarrassment that she was forced to ask Tom to assist her.  She managed to wind the cloth loosely around her in order to maintain her propriety but she suddenly missed Harry for more than personal reasons.  She had thought of asking Annika but wasn't quite ready to share this part of her morning ritual with her new love just yet, and the thought of asking Kate for help was something she wasn't ready to do.  Tom's fear of B'Elanna's strength and skills as a warrior kept him from making a fool of himself as he helped B'Elanna bind her chest and dress for the day.  To his credit his hands shook only slightly throughout the procedure.</p>
<p>When she was fully clothed she came out of the tent to find that Annika and Kate had already prepared breakfast for all of them.  They ate quickly and then they all turned to the task of tearing down the camp and preparing for the day's travel.  Without Harry the work progressed slowly.  Over the course of the year they had spent together they had developed a certain rhythm when they worked that made the tasks much simpler and quicker to accomplish than they were with other people.  Several times she had bumped into Tom or Kate as they worked, and they had to repack the wagon twice before they managed to fit all of the equipment in properly.</p>
<p>They got on the road several hours later than B'Elanna would have liked, but eventually they were all mounted and on their way.  They rode for several hours and then stopped for a quick cold lunch.  They were back on the road again but after another hour B'Elanna could see that Kate and Annika were suffering.  While both of them were used to riding on horseback it was only as a hobby and not as a method of prolonged travel.  This was the longest either of them had spent in the saddle and they were stiff and sore even though they had only been riding for a few hours.  B'Elanna pushed them as far as she dared, and to their credit neither of the women uttered one word of complaint.</p>
<p>Finally when it was getting dark B'Elanna called for them all to stop for the night.  Kate and Annika were swaying in their saddles and B'Elanna felt terrible for pushing them so hard, but the fact was that unless they made up the time they lost in the morning they would not reach their destination on time.  She and Tom began to pull the canvas for the tent out of the wagon and to her shock Annika came over and began to help.</p>
<p>"Lady Annika, please allow Tom and I to do this for you.  You are exhausted and you need your rest."</p>
<p>"I will rest when you do B'Elanna," said a very determined Annika as she continued to unload the wagon.</p>
<p>In the end B'Elanna relented and Annika helped them set up a modified version of the tent while Kate gathered wood, lit the fire and started dinner for all of them.  Tom and B'Elanna stretched some of the guy ropes from the tent between two trees and then threw the canvas over the ropes.  They pegged out the sides and corners and in this manner created a rather large, odd-looking pup tent that would keep the ladies dry should it rain in the night.  Annika set up the bedding in the tent while Tom and B'Elanna put their bedrolls next to the fire, content to sleep under the stars rather than put up the entire framework for the tent for just one evening.  They all ate by the fire with very little conversation between them.  During the course of dinner B'Elanna felt Annika lay her head on her shoulder even as she was eating.  When the meal was finished B'Elanna realized that Annika had fallen asleep with her plate in her lap and her head on her shoulder.  The strength of the feeling of tender concern that washed over B'Elanna surprised even her.  She wasn't prepared to feel so much, and it was all she could do to stop herself from crying over Annika's strength of character and the strength of the love she knew the young Lady had for her.  She had never been prouder of anyone than she was of Annika in that moment.  </p>
<p>She set the half-eaten dinner on the ground and gathered Annika in her arms, carrying the sleeping woman to the tent and laying her gently on her bedroll.  She trusted Kate to make certain that Annika was comfortable for the rest of the night.  Then, exhausted herself, she rolled up in her bedroll by the fire and was instantly asleep.</p>
<p>She awoke in the morning to the smell of breakfast cooking over the fire and to her surprise she found that Annika had arisen before them all and had built the fire up and begun the meal on her own.  She watched her love at work, unaware of the scrutiny, and smiled when she realized that Annika was humming as she toiled.  She was constantly amazed at Annika's ability to adapt to any situation in which she found herself.  She knew she couldn't have possibly fallen in love with a more perfect match.  She pushed herself up on one elbow to get a better view of her love's sensuous form as she worked, but the noise alerted Annika to the fact that she was no longer alone.  B'Elanna's heart nearly stopped when Annika smiled at her?she was so beautiful!</p>
<p>Seeing that B'Elanna was awake Annika dipped one of their mugs in the large pot of tea she was boiling and brought it over to the older woman as she lay in her blankets.  B'Elanna took the proffered mug and set it on the ground and then pulled Annika down beside her.  The beautiful blonde allowed herself to snuggle into the embrace of her love, and for a while they simple lay together watching the fire and reveling in the closeness of their bodies.  When she heard Tom begin to stir in his blankets, however, Annika kissed B'Elanna fiercely and then pulled out her embrace and went back to the fire to check on breakfast.  B'Elanna smiled at Annika's inbred delicacy and then took a long swig of the tea to prepare herself for the day.</p>
<p>This morning the packing was easy and quickly accomplished and before they knew it they were back on the road.  Once again, despite their discomfort, neither Annika nor Kate complained about the work or the pace that B'Elanna was setting.  They stopped briefly for lunch and to B'Elanna's delight they were at the next place she intended to camp long before dark.  There was a stream nearby for bathing and they were all looking forward to washing the grime of the road from their bodies and clothing.  They quickly set up camp and then took turns bathing in the river before returning to the camp to change into clean clothes.  </p>
<p>When they were all clean and clothed again there was still an hour before they needed to think about dinner.  Annika went over to the wagon and removed one of B'Elanna's swords and brought it over to where her love was oiling the leather joints on her armour.  She knelt beside the dark-haired woman and watched her meticulous work for several moments before speaking.</p>
<p>"I wish to learn how to use a sword as you do B'Elanna," she finally said.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked up with amusement in her eyes.</p>
<p>"You aren't serious are you my Lady?" she queried.</p>
<p>"I assure you I am serious."</p>
<p>"But why would you wish to know such a thing?"</p>
<p>"Because I wish to understand what it is you do when you fight.  I wish to share this experience with you, and I wish to know how to defend myself should the need every arise."</p>
<p>"Lady Annika, it is a difficult sport and requires a great deal of physical strength.  I'm certain that you wouldn't like it, and besides you are not exactly dressed for fencing my love."</p>
<p>"I feel quite certain that some of your clothing would fit me and be suitable for my purposes.  I am serious B'Elanna I wish to learn to fence."</p>
<p>"Annika, I'm sure you don't wish to be seen in men's clothing and fencing is hardly a sport for ladies?" B'Elanna began but she immediately realized her mistake when she saw the fire in Annika's eyes and the stern set to her jaw.</p>
<p>"Oh?now I understand LORD Beyla," she said in a voice dripping with sarcasm.  "You are to be the only woman who has the freedom of choice in this relationship.  You are just like a man in that you want me to be ladylike and dress appropriately and act like a piece of furniture for your benefit."</p>
<p>"Annika," B'Elanna interrupted, "I assure you that isn't what I meant."</p>
<p>"Then what exactly did you mean?"</p>
<p>"It just never occurred to me that you might be interested in such things."</p>
<p>"Well, I am interested, unless of course you think a lady such as myself is incapable of learning to fence."</p>
<p>B'Elanna wasn't going to fall into that trap a second time.</p>
<p>"Of course not Annika.  I truly believe that you can do anything you set your mind to?I'll?just find you some clothing to wear."</p>
<p>She scurried to the wagon and found some tights and a tunic that might be suitable for Annika while Kate and Tom watched, highly amused at how easily the Lady had beaten B'Elanna into submission.  This promised to be entertaining.</p>
<p>Kate followed Annika into the tent and helped her put on the unfamiliar clothing.  B'Elanna's breath caught in her throat when Annika finally emerged from the tent.  She was wearing brown tights and a white linen tunic that she had belted at the waist.  Her beautiful blonde locks were pulled back from her face and tied into a ponytail that hung down between her shoulder blades.  Although she could barely believe it, Annika looked even more beautiful than ever before.</p>
<p>B'Elanna led her out into the clearing and handed her a sword, demonstrating the proper grip and helping her into the starting position.  She then took her place opposite the younger woman and stood en garde.  Annika felt her arm tremble with the unfamiliar weight of the sword, and she began to wonder if she'd bitten off more than she could chew, but she refused to back down and she held her arm as steady as she could.  B'Elanna demonstrated the proper footwork, and soon they were crossing swords in a mock battle.  Annika found herself quickly out of breath, but she loved the feeling of learning a new skill, and she was amazed at how much easier it was for her to move without the burden of all the trappings of women's clothing.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was a patient teacher and she was impressed with how quickly Annika learned.  She stepped behind the lady and put her arms around her?showing her a different grip of the sword and guiding her hands to teach the proper methods of parrying and thrusting.  She was also enjoying very much the feeling of holding Annika's slim figure in her arms.  She lowered her voice until she was almost whispering in the young lady's ear.  Annika relaxed her body back into B'Elanna's arms and marveled at the strength she felt in the older woman's body as she led her through the movements of the fight.  B'Elanna continued to move Annika's body in the motions of fencing, all the while loving the fact that she was holding the woman she adored in her arms.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna I believe you are merely attempting to flirt with me and that you are not really teaching me fencing at all," Annika said after a while.</p>
<p>B'Elanna grinned slyly at the younger woman.  "And if I was would you like me to stop?"</p>
<p>"Don't you dare," Annika said with an answering smile, "But be warned that I will learn to fence and one of these days I may even defeat you."</p>
<p>"I have absolutely no doubt that you can do whatever you set your mind to Annika.  You amaze me.  I can't believe how well you've adjusted to living like this with me, and you already show great promise as a fencer."</p>
<p>"You are my life B'Elanna, and there is nothing I wouldn't be willing to do or sacrifice in order to be with you."</p>
<p>"So you really don't mind living so roughly as we are?"</p>
<p>"I am adjusting.  In truth I actually find myself enjoying this lifestyle.  In particular now that I have discovered the pleasures of men's clothing," she teased.</p>
<p>Seeing the look of dismay on B'Elanna's face she hastened to reassure her.  </p>
<p>"Do not worry?I will continue to dress the part of a proper lady in public as I know it is necessary, but I see no need to wear such confining garments when we are alone in the woods, do you?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna drank in the sight of her love's beautiful body looking somehow even more feminine in men's clothing and hastened to agree vehemently with Annika's assessment.</p>
<p>They continued the lesson for almost an hour until even Annika had to admit she was not strong enough to go on.  B'Elanna was impressed with how quickly the Lady had learned and how far she was willing to push herself physically.  They fell ravenously on the meal that Tom and Kate had prepared and soon afterward they all retired exhausted to bed.</p>
<p>The next day they were all up before the dawn in order to reach the tournament grounds before nightfall.  They traveled quickly and hard all day, barely stopping even to eat, but they managed to reach the town in time to have at least an hour's worth of sunlight left in order to set up their camp.  Every one of them was thrilled to find that Harry was already there ahead of them and had begun cooking a hot meal for the weary travelers.  They set up the camp in a hurry and then gratefully wolfed down the meal that Harry had provided.  Soon enough all but Harry and B'Elanna retired to sleep.  With a nod to Harry B'Elanna left the tent to sit by the fire, and she was soon joined by her trusted friend.</p>
<p>"So, did you have success with your trip?"</p>
<p>Harry paused a moment and B'Elanna was aware that her heart was pounding as she waited for his answer.</p>
<p>"I did my friend.  It is all arranged."</p>
<p>B'Elanna stared into the fire a slow smile spreading over her features.</p>
<p>"I will speak to her at the ball after the tournament."</p>
<p>"Think you'll be able to concentrate with all of that on your mind?"</p>
<p>"I think I'll manage Harry?don't know if I'll get any sleep tonight however."</p>
<p>"Well you'd better?you don't want to lose this tournament in particular do you.  Think what that would look like," Harry teased.</p>
<p>"In that case I suppose I had better get to bed."  She paused for a moment before saying, "Harry?I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me."</p>
<p>"The feeling is more than mutual I assure you B'Elanna, more than mutual."</p>
<p>The two friends embraced warmly before heading off to bed.  Contrary to her fears B'Elanna fell asleep almost the moment her head touched her pillow.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>The next day was a whirlwind of competition for B'Elanna. This particular tournament was a day shorter than the rest and so she spent the entire day racing from the sword ring to the jousting lists.  Only the fact that her retinue had expanded allowed her time to eat and change and attend all of the events.  Everyone was busy but they were all happy and B'Elanna once again ended the day undefeated.  It was after dark before the equipment was cleaned and put away and the horses' needs attended to, and once again the crew ate hungrily and retired immediately.  </p>
<p>True to her word B'Elanna was once again crowned as tournament champion by the end of the second day.  As tired as she was B'Elanna was almost vibrating with excitement as she prepared for the night's banquet.  Harry had to calm her down several times as she paced around their half of the tent.  He finally insisted she sit in a chair and simply listen to her own breathing until he felt she was calm enough to go and get Annika so they could walk to the banquet hall together.  He gave her a quick hug before she left and wished her the best of luck.</p>
<p>Walking arm in arm to the banquet hall Annika could sense that B'Elanna had something on her mind.  She attempted to draw the warrior out on the subject but B'Elanna was not forthcoming.  Once they reached the banquet hall and the dancing began B'Elanna calmed down somewhat, although it amused Annika no end to see her graceful warrior trip over her own feet twice during the dancing.  Whatever was on her mind, Annika was grateful that it hadn't interfered with her performance during the games.</p>
<p>They danced all night with their friends and were among the last to leave the banquet hall.  B'Elanna had seemed reluctant to go, and Annika was more confused than ever as to what was on her love's mind.  When they finally walked out into the night Annika forced herself not to pester B'Elanna with questions about what was on her mind.  She trusted that B'Elanna would speak to her when she was ready.  Her patience was rewarded when they were crossing the river back to the tournament campgrounds.</p>
<p>At the centre of the bridge B'Elanna stopped walking and they leaned against the rail and watched the black water slip away beneath them.  Annika recognized that something important was about to happen and so she merely waited silently for B'Elanna to finally tell her what was on her mind.  After a few moments of silent contemplation B'Elanna took a very deep breath, squared her shoulders and turned to face Annika.  Wordlessly B'Elanna gestured to the night sky.  Looking up they saw a blanket of stars whose beauty defied description.</p>
<p>"Annika if I had as many words as there are stars in the sky tonight I still could not adequately describe all that I feel in my heart for you."</p>
<p>She paused for a moment and then took both of Annika's hands in her own.</p>
<p>"Lady Hansart you know how much I love you.  I can never tell you what it means to me that you have forsaken everything you know in life to come and be with me.  I can never express my feelings of joy and pride in your strength and your love.  I only wish I were a poet or a bard that I might better tell you of my feelings?of my love.  There is so much that I wish I could give you."</p>
<p>Annika took B'Elanna's beautiful face in both of her hands and looked deeply into her love's liquid brown eyes.</p>
<p>"My beautiful B'Elanna?how can you not know by now that you and your love are all that I will ever need in this world."</p>
<p>B'Elanna almost lost control of her emotions at hearing Annika's heartfelt speech, but she managed to reign herself in for the moment.  She reached into the pocket of her tunic and drew out the ring she had been carrying with her for some time now.  She managed a weak smile.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear you say that my Lady, because all that I have to offer you in this world are my heart and my love?but nevertheless they are yours if you'll have them.  So what say you Lady Hansart?will you marry me?"</p>
