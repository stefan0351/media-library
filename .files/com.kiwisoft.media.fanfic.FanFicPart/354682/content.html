<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 14 -->

<p>Xander was the one to answer Riley as the rifle at his
shoulder unleashed a tongue of fire in Riley's direction. The former
soldier's instincts still seemed to be intact as he dived out of the
way, but the hailstorm did manage to catch one of his creatures and
sent one of his creatures squealing to the floor in a pool of dark
green blood. Willow had ducked down beside a near by jeep and Buffy
and Faith took that as their signal to jump into action. Each jumping
away from their starting positions to engage one of their demonic
foes. Spike chose to charge straight up the middle as he ran towards
his wayward progeny. "Come give daddy a kiss!" Riley had rolled to his
feet. "Ahh, but dad, I already gave you the gift that keeps on
hurting." The two vampires stalked around each other, both swinging at
apparent openings.</p>

<p>Xander held his rifle on them a second, but couldn't find his
shot. It was not a matter of being afraid he might hurt Spike as much
as it was he needed the majority of rounds hitting Riley. Instead he
crouched down next to Willow and braced the rifle on the jeep's frame.
He switched the fire selector from fully automatic to semi-automatic
and began seeking out targets away from the battling slayers. Buffy
was currently tangling with a Minotaur-like demon with neon blue and
pink making up his fur and flesh. "Faith!" The dark slayer glanced
over and saw the demon's height was giving it an advantage over Buffy.
She then looked back at her own demon was far closer to her own height
and took several steps back.  "Wanna trade B?" She continued to battle
as Buffy spoke. "You got it." Faith finished her demon off and moved
to another one. </p>

<p>"I don't know, this one looks pretty easy." She could see that
Buffy was just getting annoyed with her foe and was yet to be in any
actual danger so she allowed herself the banter. The light slayer was
breathless, but grinning. "I'll throw in a back rub." Faith grinned.
"Deal!" She then dropped to her knee at the side of a reptilian demon
that had human arms, but moved around on a reptile's tail. Since the
creature had to raise itself up on it's tail in order to attack so it
was unable to follow Faith before Buffy was able to move in, and this
time her height was an advantage because the creature's blows were all
going too high. Buffy had been fighting with a small one handed axe
and by aiming for the gaps in the scales the blade had no difficulty
sinking in.</p>

<p>Down on one knee she braced her hands on the floor and swung
out her feet to connect with the back of Buffy's demon's knee. The
creature crumpled and fell onto its back. She finished the motion by
tucking her knees under her and rolling up. Her left hand jerked the
creatures muzzle up while her right drove the knife she was fighting
with into the creature's neck. The creature screamed a warbling death,
but the amount of blood pouring from the wound let Faith know he was
not getting back up. The next thing she felt was hand pulling her up
and holding her in a chokehold from behind, but it was only there
seconds and the hands turned to dust around her neck. She turned and
Buffy was there holding the axe and standing in a pile of ash, the
body of the reptilian demon behind her.</p>

<p>They both turned and saw Riley fighting Spike. Faith spared a
second to look at Buffy, but she did not see a grieving girlfriend,
but a slayer and when that slayer looked into her eyes the both nodded
and charged. Sure demons reached out in them but flashing blades left
few alive, and none whole. Riley saw all that happen from his battle
with Spike and saw how few of his followers had survived the combined
efforts of the slayers and their sniper. Even his sire might not have
been able to beat him yet, but Riley was feeling tired, while Spike
was grinning from ear to ear. Riley reached into his jacket and pushed
a button, instantly Spike dropped to his knees clutching his forehead.
Riley grinned down at his sire's still human face and brandished a
stake, but the stake, and the hand holding it were shattered by a one
of Xander's high velocity messengers.</p>

<p>A second bullet took out the device and Spike stopped
clutching his head. Instead he kneeled on the floor and looked up at
his childe and growled. As the device was destroyed what few beasts
were left behind suddenly had the fight go out of them, but Riley was
not there to care as he jumped out the window and screamed at the
contact of sunlight as he tore up a man hole cover and disappeared
inside. The slayers ran out and were ready to dive inside until a
closely following Xander grabbed both of their shoulders and yanked
them back. They were about to yell at him when he pointed out a bulge
by the manhole that Riley had jumped over. He dropped his hands.
"Riley has the training and equipment to set up some nasty booby
traps, and I don't want to think what he'll have waiting in the
sewers. </p>

<p>Spike spoke up from the shadows of the building. "The weenie
is right!" Xander just leveled the assault rifle at Spike as the
vampire jumped back and held up his hands. The slayers nodded and they
both smiled at Xander as they thanked him. "I want to take this chance
to grab some gear, but it's a shock nobody has noticed the dead guard
yet. So we better get out of here soon." As they stepped back in the
building Spike was lighting another cigarette. "Nothing to worry about
there. Riley wanted the place to himself." All three darkened as they
looked at Spike. "Don't look at me. He sent his little friends out to
do the dirt while he re-fixed me." Buffy stepped close. "So Riley can
control demons?" Spike shrugged. "Not all of them pet. Just the ones
with the shiny new chips, a handful of which survived the big blow out
with the Initiative, but he DID pull out A LOT of equipment."</p>

<p>Buffy exhaled. "So he has the equipment to make himself a
demon army? Why didn't the Initiative do that?" Spike shrugged once
more. "He said something about getting more insight into the demon
mind." They all seemed to consider this, but Xander was the first to
recover. "I'm going to grab that gear." Willow's eyes suddenly went
wide. "I could try to find a manifest!" The redheaded hacker quickly
found a computer console and set to work. Faith looked around
dubiously. "Should we really be pawing everything? I mean they got
Spike's prints from that stake?" Buffy smiled. "The government has to
have us on files already, and Spike, well that's his problem." Spike
grimaced at the shorter slayer. "Great, now I am going to have to
break into ANOTHER damn lab. With my luck the fingerprint guy will
probably summon demons as a hobby."</p>

<p>They ignored the vampires whining as Xander returned with
several heavy olive drab bags. Both slayer's eyes got wide and Xander
grinned and shrugged. "Waste not want not." Buffy put her hands on her
hips. "And where do you plan on keeping all that?" Xander paused. "I'm
sure Giles will let me stash it with the rest of the weapons." Buffy
and Faith both smirked and nodded dubiously as all four of them walked
over to where Willow was working. She looked up as they approached. "I
have the Initiative manifest, but we will have to guess what he took."
Spike took a deep drag off of his cigarette. "Probably all of it.
There was three trucks worth of stuff." Buffy nodded her expression
back to a steely mask. "All right, let's go." As they opened the door
Spike looked out at the last rays of day and then gave Buffy a pointed
look. Faith shrugged and pulled a tarp off of one of the vehicles.</p>

<p>Spike looked down at where it landed when Faith tossed it at
his feet. He grumbled while he threw his cigarette and stepped on it.
"Thanks." Faith grinned. "Welcome." Spike then picked up the tarp and
draped it over his head while he followed them all out to the car. He
originally reclined on the passenger seat but had to sit up when
Xander got in the car after storing the munitions in the vehicle's
trunk. The three girls elected to sit in the back while Xander took
the wheel. Faith was at one window and Buffy was at the other so both
slayers could keep their enhanced senses on the look out for police or
military forces investigating the base. Willow was sandwiched between
the two girls, but did not seem to notice because a silence had fallen
over the entire group and remained until they made their way back to
the mansion.</p>

<p>By the time night had fallen and they were all able to get out
of the car. Spike simply tossed the tarp onto the ground, but at the
questioning glances of the two slayers he picked it back up and was
about to stuff it back inside the car. Xander stopped him, as the
munitions were unloaded. Xander got Faith's attention while they were
doing so. "Faith? You think I could stash this stuff inside the
mansion?" The dark slayer looked a bit wary as she eyed the military
equipment, but she eventually did nod. "Just put it in an unused part
and make SURE it's packed safe." Xander looked offended, but he
nodded. He then took the tarp from Spike and laid it with the pile of
gear. </p>

<p>When they entered the mansion only Anya was there and she was
able to read the looks on their faces, especially Spike's. "Why do you
have Spike and not Riley? Did he manage to turn the chip back on?"
Spike scowled at the former demon as Buffy spoke. "Yeah, where's Giles
and Tara?" Anya shrugged. "They went to the police station to look for
photos of Spike." Spike laughed as he took a seat. "Well unless they
have records going back a couple centuries they're wasting their
time." Buffy crossed her arms over her chest. "They are dealing with
the police because YOU charged into a hospital." Spike shrugged. "Be
happy I didn't kill anyone." Buffy narrowed her eyes at him. "Except
Riley." Spike threw his head back and sighed. "Oh come on slayer! I
did you a favor. You think Mr. All American would let his wife have a
career of her own?"</p>

<p>She stomped to stand right in front of him. "He was working
with me while you were working with Adam." Spike lifted his head back
up and grinned at her. "What? You trying to lay a guilt trip on me?
For that to work I'd have to have a conscience, and come on, your much
happier with the wild cat." The wild cat in question stepped up next
to Buffy's side and took her hand. "Still, you didn't have to kill
him." Spike shrugged. "Fish swim, birds fly, vampires kill. He's the
one who took the cuffs off." Xander had carried the gear into an
unused room and laid the tarp over it before coming back to the living
room. "Perhaps we should return the favor?" Spike rolled his eyes at
him. "Come on. If I remember right you were saying he was evil before
anyone else."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but turning him made him all the worse." Anya then
picked the moment to wrap her arms around Xander's elbow and spoke to
him quietly. "Umm… did you manage to snag a military uniform?" She
pouted as he shook his head and Spike smirked at the exchange. "All
right, I admit turning him was a mistake. Now lets all just move on."
Before they could move on sirens blared and 4 police cars screamed up
to the mansion. Spike was already moving as Buffy spoke to him.
"Spike! Hide!" A second later there was pounding on the door. "Miss.
Pryce! Come to the door or we are coming in!" Faith had gotten as pale
as any bed sheet as she walked to the door and opened it. The police
officer had his sidearm drawn as he and several others charged into
the room. "Miss. Pryce, is he here?" They all blinked as Faith
stammered. "Who? Is who here?" </p>

<p>The officers were fanning out to each person, and the Scoobies
were getting nervous. "Riley Finn or the man who attacked him. "You're
safe now. If they are here just tell us." The officers had pulled the
Scoobies up and were getting them out of the house as Faith shouted.
"No! It's ok. We're the only ones here. I mean it." The officers
stopped herding everyone to the door as Faith took a calming breath.
"We just woke up and Anya told us the Giles and Tara had went to the
station." The officers had dropped the weapons to hang at their sides
as the first officer began speaking again. "They never made it to the
station. The squad car was found with the officers killed and your
friends missing. We were afraid they would come here next." They were
all coming down from the shock of the police storming the house as the
cops starting holstering their weapons. "Still, we could protect you
better at the station."</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. "No, no, we just want to stay here, ok."
The officer looked dubious, but his expression also said he knew that
he couldn't force the issue. "Ok, but I want to station two squad
cars. We are dealing with a cop killer who seems determined to get
you." Faith nodded. "That would be great, thank you." The two groups
just seemed to stare at each other, but more as a matter of lingering
adrenaline then any antagonism. Faith kept nodding as she followed
them to the door. "Thank you officer." He nodded as well. "We'll be
right outside your door." She continued to nod. "Thank you." He
slipped out and Faith shut, and locked the door behind him. She then
turned around and slumped against it as Buffy walked over and pulled
her into a hug. "I was so scared Buffy, I thought it was going to
happen all over again."</p>

<p>Buffy smoothed the brunette's wild hair, while Faith didn't
say it they all knew she feared being in trouble with the law again.
Vampires were one thing, but the police were every where, and couldn't
just be killed like the undead, because for every one killed a hundred
started looking for you. Xander sat back down. "I guess that now that
the mayor and the Initiative are gone police are finally getting a
clue." Faith looked up with confusion on her face. While Mayor Wilkins
had been evil the fact was that if he didn't tamper with evidence she
would be in prison. Of course most of her murders were committed at
his command, so maybe it was only fair. She shrugged off the dark
thoughts as she stood up, but she kept contact with Buffy by holding
the other slayer's hand.</p>

<p>That was the moment Spike stuck his head out. "Well this is
bloody perfect. Guess I have more days and night of being locked in
the crypt. The days I don't mind, obviously but the nights are not
going to be pleasant." Buffy looked at Spike. "Just want do you DO all
day?" Spike saw the little smirk tugging at the slayer's face. "Shut
up! Let's see you have to spend the entire day inside under the fear
of a blistering, burning death." Anya then spoke up. "You should get
cable." Spike rolled his eyes. "I doubt they'd be willing to send an
installer out." Willow then spoke up, though her pallor, and the way
she seemed to mumble, made everyone fear she was in shock. "What about
a satellite system?" Spike's eyebrows arched. "Heyyyyy that's not a
bad idea." Buffy stepped forward, but she pulled Faith with her as she
kept her grip on the dark slayer's hand. "Ok, I think we have more
important things to discuss right now then Spike's TV watching
habits."</p>
