<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 21 -->

<p>The long shiny black limousine pulled smoothly into the parking lot
followed closely by two shorter chauffeured vehicles. All of them came
to a stop at the front of the big brick building that had been rented
for the reception. </p>

<p>Xander, Cordelia, Giles, and Joyce Summers exited the second car and
went directly into the building followed by Ira and Sheila Rosenberg. </p>

<p>After several minutes a frustrated Sheila Rosenberg came storming out of
the building and began pounding on the door of the limo that still
contained the newly weds. </p>

<p>"Willow!" the angry woman shouted. "Will you and your little friend get
out here right now?"
When she received no answer, Mrs. Rosenberg pounded so hard it hurt her
hand which made her even madder at the two young women in the car. </p>

<p>"Willow Rosenberg!" she yelled at the top of her lungs, her face beet
red with anger. "Get out here this instant. The guests will be arriving
any minute now and we need to set up the receiving line. This 'marriage'
is bad enough without the added embarrassment of being rude." </p>

<p>That worked better than she wanted. The door flew open and an extremely
enraged and dishevelled Willow Rosenberg-Summers jumped out of the limo
and into her mother's face. </p>

<p>"I've had just about enough of your attitude mother." Willow growled,
her entire body trembling with rage and hurt. "If you don't like the
idea of my wife and I letting the world know of our love, then there is
no reason for you to be here and Believe me, after the way you've acted
the last few weeks neither of us would miss you in the least. I will
personally see to it that you are escorted home and we'll make sure that
daddy gets home after the reception. So what is it mother, are you
staying or leaving?" </p>

<p>"Honey, please don't do this." Buffy whispered in her wife's ear. She
had followed Willow out of the limo and had stood calmly behind her
during the red-head's outburst at her overbearing mother. "You know how
your mother is and it isn't fair to expect her to become a different
person over night. This is our day don't let her ruin it." </p>

<p>Hearing her lover's plea on behalf of her own aggravating mother touched
the witch on so many levels that it took all her will not to release the
flood of tears that threatened to flow in rivers from her eyes.
It was hard to believe that after everything her mother had done to
them, her new bride still came to her defence. Even if they both thought
that. The guilt of throwing her mother out of the reception would have
wrecked the entire day for Willow, and Buffy was really thinking of her
lover when she spoke. </p>

<p>Sheila looked at the petite blonde slack jawed with surprise at her
words. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry love." Willow said. embarrassed when she calmed enough to
realise they were standing outside and that people were beginning to
arrive. "If you plan on staying mother, you'd better come in with us.
Just remember one more comment about my wife or our relationship and you
are out of here, not to mention out of our lives. Do you understand me?" </p>

<p>"Yes I understand." Mrs. Rosenberg said in defeat, realizing that she'd
over stepped herself and how lucky she was that her daughter's friend
had spoken up for her. "I'm sorry dear, I shouldn't have said that."
Silently accepting her mother's apology, Willow turned and wrapped her
arm around Buffy's waist kissing her lightly. </p>

<p>"You are truly amazing, you know that?" the red head told her bride.
"Every time I think I know how you'll react to something, you turn
around and do something like this. I so love you." </p>

<p>"Of course you do." Buffy said, smiling with complete adoration at her
love. "Don't you remember? I'm irresistible." </p>

<p>Both of the newly weds broke into peals of laughter as they led the way
to the doors.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The rest of the reception went fairly smoothly, thanks to Cordelia's
taking the time to research what was expected at both the usual
reception and what was done at a typical Jewish reception. </p>

<p>In order to keep the peace with Willow's family, she had been sure to
have a band to handle the traditional dances and activities so that the
Rosenberg's relatives were satisfied. </p>

<p>Once that part of the party was over and most of the older crowd had
left, Cordelia had arranged for the DJ from the Bronze to take over the
musical entertainment. </p>

<p>Having prepared for the change in atmosphere the girls had Xander go out
to their cars in the parking lot and bring in their bags that had a
change of clothes. </p>

<p>Once they were dressed in more casual clothing and the Rosenbergs had
gone on home the two lovers felt free to relax and enjoy themselves. </p>

<p>Surrounded by their friends they knew they had no reason to worry about
offending anyone, and were free to express their intense feelings for
each other. </p>

<p>They danced, drank, laughed, and had fun with their guests, not to
mention many PDAs. Finally they reached the point where they were
getting tired and Buffy began talking about retiring to the posh hotel
that their friends had all chipped in and got them for their wedding
night. </p>

<p>"I know you're tired honey." Willow whispered in the Slayer's ear. "But
if you'll just give me one more dance we'll ditch this place and head
for the sheets, okay?"
"Anything for you sweetie." Buffy answered, while nibbling at her
lover's ear, causing the witch to groan. "But don't take too long. I
need to have you now. And if you don't want to live one of Xander's
fantasies, you'll be getting me out of here soon." </p>

<p>"No probs, babe." Willow said, gulping hard. "Just a little patience. I
promise it'll be worth it. I hope." </p>

<p>Willow went over and said something to the DJ who smiled and nodded to
her, then reached out and shook the girl's hand. Willow turned and
strolled back to her curious lover, smiling brightly. </p>

<p>"What are you up to?" the blonde asked suspiciously, as she melted into
her beloved's arms. </p>

<p>"It's just...well..I kinda...this is..." Willow tried to explain, tongue
tied with emotion. "Ever since this song came out it's made me think of
you and how I felt about you. I'd be willing to bet I wore out 10 or 20
of these CDs just listening to it over and over. And I figured I'd share
it with you and hope it meant as much to you as it does to me." </p>

<p>"I'm sure it will, my love." Buffy answered, her voice thick with the
deep feelings she felt at her lover's admission. </p>

<p>Willow gathered Buffy into her arms tightly, as the DJ began the CD and
the music came flooding from the sound system. The Slayer felt as much
as heard her partner singing softly into her ear.</p>

<p>{{"And I'd give up forever to touch you | Cause I know that you feel me somehow | Your the closest to heaven that I'll ever be | And I don't wanna go home right now"}}</p>

<p>Buffy was oblivious to every thing around her. Her entire being was
focused on the beautiful alto voice of her universe singing in her ear
and the words being written on her soul.</p>

<p>{{"And all I can taste is this moment | And all I can breath is your life | And sooner or later it's over | I just don't wanna miss you tonight"}}</p>

<p>Willow could feel her heart pouring out of her and into the woman she
loved with each word. She was trying to convey all the soul searing
emotions that her heart felt for this tiny woman that she was holding in
her arms. Hoping all the while that her reason for being was
experiencing the same thing.</p>

<p>{{"And I don't want the world to see me | Cause I think that they'd understand | When everything's made to be broken | I just want you to know who I am"}}</p>

<p>Both young were entranced with each other and didn't even notice when
everyone else cleared the dance floor to watch the tender moment
occurring between the newlyweds.</p>

<p>{{"And you can't fight the tears that ain't comin | Or the moment of truth in your lies | When everything feels like the movies | And you bleed just to know you're alive"}}</p>

<p>Willow was overcome by her emotions and her throat was too tight to
finish to sing the final chorus. All she could do was hold her Buffy
tightly in her arms and let her feelings flow in mute rivers into the
ocean of her lover's soul. </p>

<p>Knowing the deep need to express herself that her new bride was trying
to deal with, Buffy remained silent and held on to the trembling
red-head letting the waves of emotion wash over her. </p>

<p>When the music stopped they continued to hold on to each other in the
middle of the dance floor. In order to minimise an awkward moment,
Cordelia signalled the DJ to play something else and, pulling Xander
onto the dance floor, began to dance. </p>

<p>Thus drawing attention away from the two entranced lovers, who were
totally absorbed in each other, oblivious to those around them. </p>

<p>Finally remembering that they weren't alone the newlyweds went to the
bar to have one last drink before sneaking out.
Raising their glasses to Cordelia in thanks for all her hard work, they
finished the drinks in one gulp. </p>

<p>They were setting down their drinks in preparation to leave when one of
their friends came up to them and handed Buffy a note. </p>

<p>"I don't know what it is." the young man explained. "This guy I've never
seen before, that was dressed like Rambo or something, gave it to me and
asked me to bring it to you. To be honest he was kinda scary so I did
what he said, I hope that's okay." </p>

<p>"No problem Jerry." Willow told the obviously still frightened young man
while her partner read the note. "It's probably a good idea that you
did. Cause if it's from who I think it is, you're right, he is scary." </p>

<p>Mumbling his thanks the young man rejoined the rest of the party and
went back to enjoying the festivities. Willow turned and looked at her
lover as the blonde read the note. </p>

<p>"What is it, Buffy?" Willow asked, worried that their one night
honeymoon was about to be called off. "Is everything alright?" </p>

<p>"I guess it's okay." the Slayer mumbled as she finished the missive and
handed it to the witch. "Check it out for yourself and see what you make
of it." </p>

<p>Willow took the note from her partner and the first thing she noticed
was the heavy bond paper that it was written on. Next she saw that it
was written with a neat flowing hand that while written with an ancient
form of lettering but the note was easy to read and was obviously
written by a well educated and in an aristocratic style by someone with
lots of practice at writing reports and messages. </p>

<p>The most surprising and somewhat frightening thing was who it was from
and what they wanted. She read it over several times to be sure that she
hadn't misunderstood it's meaning.</p>

<p><i>To The Slayer and The Sorceress </i></p>

<p><i>Ladies,<br>
I would greatly appreciate it if you would both meet myself and my
personal guard in the parking lot. </i></p>

<p><i>We mean you no harm and wish to relay information that I am sure you
will find both necessary and at least partially welcome. </i></p>

<p><i>Please come as it would be inconvenient for all concerned if I was
compelled to enter the building to deliver my message.</i></p>

<p><i>With Respect</i></p>

<p><i>Kresis<br>
Count of the First Circle<br>
Lord of the House of Red Swords </i></p>

<p>Willow looked at her wife and waited for her to indicate what course of
action they would take. </p>

<p>"Well it looks like he's given us no choice." The Slayer said, shrugging
her shoulders. "I thought about having you stay here, but he asked for
both of us and besides that you wouldn't stay anyway." </p>

<p>"You're darn skippy on that." Willow announced fiercely . "That's the
deal now. Where you go, I go, no discussion no, compromises. You got
that almighty Slayer?" </p>

<p>"Yes my loving wife and Sorceress." Buffy said, beaming at the red
head's resolve and devotion. "All or nothing from now on." </p>

<p>"You got it." the witch agreed, and linked arms with her lover. "Let's
go sweetie. We got a Count to see." </p>

<p>The two women walked out of the building and stepped into the well lit
parking lot. They strolled casually over to Willow's car and leaned on
it to await their visitor.
They didn't have to wait long. </p>

<p>Two dark figures separated from the shadows surrounding the parking area
and slowly approached them keeping their hands in sight to make the
point that they were unarmed and came in peace. Willow took the time to
study the two entities the were coming toward them. </p>

<p>One was the soldier she'd seen after the fight with Hela, she could tell
by the way he moved and the black patch over his right eye. </p>

<p>The other was the tall regal 'man' that had confronted the demoness and
although he had failed to destroy or capture her, he had caused her to
run away. He was walking with a slight limp and Willow saw that he was
missing his right arm. </p>

<p>When they were within a couple of feet Buffy stopped them. </p>

<p>"I think that's close enough gentlemen." the Slayer said holding out a
hand "I believe you said you had some news for us. So what is it? We
have friends to get back to." </p>

<p>"Ah right to the point Slayer, I can respect that." the one armed 'man'
remarked with a slightly quirky smile. "Especially on ones wedding
night." </p>

<p>He gripped the Slayer's forearm in the traditional warrior's greeting,
followed by the second figure. The Count then turned and lifting
Willow's offered hand let his lips brush across the back of her hand. </p>

<p>Willow blushed at this courtesy and a low defensive growl came from her
lover. In respect for the Slayer's feelings the Count released the hand
and stepped back. His companion simply bowed respectfully to the witch
then rejoined his commander. </p>

<p>"First I suppose I should introduce my companion and myself." Kresis
said, looking at the two warriors that had fought him and Hela to a
stand still, his respect for them rising as he realized how young they
were. "As I said in my note, I am Count Kresis and this is my aide,
general, and friend Caladin, and first I would like to convey or
congratulations and best wishes on this momentous occasion." </p>

<p>"Thank you." Willow answered quickly, before her lover could come up
with an insult for these unexpected allies. "But I'm sure you didn't go
through all the trouble to get us out here just to wish us well." </p>

<p>"Quite so, Sorceress." the Count answered. "I can see you are perceptive
as well as powerful and beautiful. No we didn't come here to wish you
well, I am here to give you some good news and a warning.
First of all we have searched thoroughly and all indications are that
our mutual opponent has left not only this town but this country all
together.
We will continue to hunt the bitch until we have delivered her to
justice in our home realm.
However I must warn you that Hela is a spiteful and vindictive being and
as long as she is free to roam your realm neither of you is completely
secure.
She hates to lose and she despises loose ends, and the two of you are
both.
Do not doubt for a second that she will be trying to come up with a way
to get back at you both in the most painful way she can conceive." </p>

<p>"We thank you for the warning Count." Buffy said thoughtfully. "Believe
me, we will take it to heart. I also wish you luck in your hunt, for
obvious reasons and to thank you, Caladin and your warriors, for your
best wishes and concern for our well being.
I only hope that we are not forced to face each other as enemies at some
future time." </p>

<p>"I wish the same Chosen One." came Caladin's gruff voice in reply. "But
if that should come to pass, you will be an enemy I will face with honor
and respect. Be Well." </p>

<p>The two figures bowed and turned, quickly disappearing into the night,
leaving the two young women looking at each in wonder at the old battle
scared veteran's parting words. </p>

<p>Willow looked over at her wife and didn't need to know her thoughts to
know what was going through her mind. </p>

<p>"Well that was semi-good news." Willow said lightly, trying to relieve
some of the tension their visitors had caused. "At least we can get
through the rest of the joining without having to worry about that not
so nice female trying to take you away from
me." </p>

<p>She gave the Slayer one of her best don't-worry-about-me smiles and took
the lovely blonde into a tight embrace. Willow could feel the tense
muscles relax as Buffy melted into the warm loving pressure of the
witch's embrace. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before all thoughts of Kresis, Hela, or any future
problems with either of them were driven from the Slayer's mind by her
lover's persistent attentions. </p>

<p>"What do you say we go inside, say our goodbyes and get this honeymoon
thing on the road?" Willow whispered into Buffy's ear. The warm air of
the red head's breath washed over Buffy's ear causing the Slayer to
shiver with excitement. </p>

<p>"Oh yeah." the blonde said, her voice horse with anticipation. "That's
the best idea I've heard since we got here."</p>

<p>Holding hands the two newlyweds ran into the building and bid their
remaining friends a fond farewell and told everyone to stay as long as
they liked. They were soon in Willow's car and headed toward the most
exclusive hotel in Sunnydale. </p>

<p>Willow parked her car in the covered lot and, after checking in at the
front desk, the two excited young women went to their room on the top
most floor. </p>

<p>When they entered the room they were both stunned by the opulence of the
room (suite really) that their friends had gotten them. </p>

<p>The entire suite was the very definition of understated elegance. While
under normal circumstances, they would have spent hours exploring every
inch of the rooms thoroughly. But on this night, after a cursory
examination, they were only interested in each other. </p>

<p>They fell into each other's arms and began kissing each other
passionately, tongues swirling around each other, trying to inspect
every centimeter of the other's oral cavity, while anxious hands tore
off clothing desperate to feel and taste bare skin. </p>

<p>Both were breathing heavily, interspersed with pleading whimpers for
more intimate contact. </p>

<p>Finally, after their clothing was scattered all over the area and their
knees were ready to buckle with unrequited lust, Buffy scooped her
red-haired bride into her arms and without breaking the kiss, carried
her willing captive into the adjoining bedroom and gently laid her on
the soft comfortable oversized mattress. </p>

<p>Buffy looked deeply into the eyes of her existence and saw only
overwhelming love and all consuming passion there. </p>

<p>Then with a growl of pure lust the Slayer took the body that held the
other half of her soul and the two lovers spent the rest of the night
satisfying the call of their needs and most primal urges, their names
being called out to the gods until they both collapsed in total and
sated exhaustion still holding each other as they drifted off into a
contented dreamless sleep. </p>

<p>The next morning, just as the sun made it's daily appearance on the
Eastern horizon and shafts of red, orange, and golden light lanced
through the cloudless sky driving away the last vestiges of night, the
two still very tired women were wakened by a persistent knocking at the
heavy oak door of their suite. </p>

<p>A grumpy half asleep red head untangled herself from her blonde lover
and, pulling on a robe, she went to answer the door. </p>

<p>As Willow suspected, when she opened the door she was greeted by two
gray robed Druids. Their hoods were up and it was impossible to see
their faces. </p>

<p>They were accompanied by four women that Willow recognised as members of
the coven that was assisting with their formal joining ceremony. </p>

<p>The six came in and one of the priests faced Willow ad placed his hands
gently on her shoulders. </p>

<p>"It is time for you to prepare, Sorceress." the man informed her in a
deep resonate voice that reminded the witch of their friend Lugh. "You
and your beloved, the sister of your soul, must now accompany us to the
place set aside for the preliminaries required by tradition for the
completion of your becoming as one." </p>

<p>"I understand." Willow answered solemnly. "I will awaken my other half
and we will follow your instructions." </p>

<p>With a nod from the priest, Willow and the four attendants went into the
bedroom and, with a fair amount of trouble, finally managed to wake a
reluctant Buffy. With the assistance of their attendants, both were
dressed only in two intricately embroidered black and silver velvet
robes.
Once they were ready the group joined the two priests that were
patiently waiting for them in the other room. Each priest approached one
of the two women and simultaneously explained the procedures to be
followed for the day. </p>

<p>"From now until tonight's ceremony, the two of you will be separated."
the priests droned. "We will be with you through out the day to assist
you in the various necessary rituals that must be performed. This is the
way it has been done for countless generations and has been handed down
by our forebears. Now if you will accompany us after bidding your
beloved a temporary farewell, the rituals shall begin." </p>

<p>With a quick kiss and whispered words of encouragement, the two young
lovers left each with one priest and two of the females. Neither knowing
for sure what they would face that day and each knowing that no matter
what was asked of them they would do it because that was what was
necessary for them to be together completely and forever. </p>

<p>If nothing else Willow was sure this would be an adventure. </p>
