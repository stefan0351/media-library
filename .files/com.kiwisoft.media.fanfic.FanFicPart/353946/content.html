<!-- About a Girl \ Part 12 -->

<p>Katie took Jessie's hand into hers; drawing it upwards against her face, placing a soft kiss on Jessie's palm before looking down into her big, blue, terrified eyes. "We don't have to go in," Katie said softly, her voice nonetheless carrying in the empty hallways making it almost painfully loud. "Seriously," she continued. "It's like an Oscar, being asked is enough."</p>

<p>"But everyone wants to win," Jessie responded stepping closer to Katie, pressing their bodies together sighing gently as she felt Katie's arm wrap around her. "I wouldn't have asked you if I didn't want to go."</p>

<p>"Okay," Katie whispered, her hands moving across Jessie's back slowly. It was one of those times where she just needed to give Jessie a moment. To sort out or accept whatever it was she was feeling at the moment. She had learned, as they spent more time together how deeply everything affected Jessie, how sensitive she was to everything around her. She herself was deeply affected by things as well, her mother's depression and the stress it was causing within her family, hadn't left her as unaffected as she tried to project. But she had learned somewhere down the road how to push it aside, how to put on a brave face and march like a good little soldier. But Jessie lived in a glass house where everything was visible, every wound, and every scar there for the world to see if they cared to look. She sometimes felt about as deep as a puddle around Jessie, but she loved that about her. She had learned that it sometimes meant that it took Jessie longer to settle things, that sometimes you just needed to give her time and quiet. So she held her, and waited for her to move. </p>

<p>"Ready?" Katie asked feeling Jessie shift in her arms and begin to move out of them, stepping back.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said reaching out for Katie's hand, grasping it in hers.</p>

<hr>

<p> "Can I borrow her for a minute or twenty?" Katie asked coming up behind Jessie, though her gaze was focused on Grace whom her girlfriend had been talking to. "They're about to play our song," she continued turning her head to face Jessie.</p>

<p>"We have a song?" Jessie asked smiling as Katie stepped into view.</p>

<p>"You'll see," Katie responded cryptically. "I had to promise the DJ my first born, so we've got to get out there and enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Sounds serious, you better go," Grace responded smiling at the display as she heard a few soft cords start up in the background. Jessie smiled back at her and then Katie took her by the hand, leading her out to the dance floor.</p>

<p>"Billie Holiday?" Jessie asked smiling as Katie wrapped her arms around her waist pulling her closer.</p>

<p>"God Bless the Child," Katie responded resting her forehead against Jessie's as a smile etched it's way across her features. "That's got her own, that's got her own," Katie whispered brushing her lips across Jessie's.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled as they pulled apart burying her head in the crook of Katie's neck as they swayed to the soulful sounds of Billie Holiday. The room faded, the voices of the others in the room faded, the lights and everything else except the voice and the feel of Katie against her faded into the background. And Jessie took a deep breath, inhaling Katie's scent letting the sensations wash over her and carry her away to a magical place covered in gardenias where the sun shone on your face all day long. So this was love, she thought to herself as she felt Katie's cheek press against her own, so this is love.</p>

<p>"Billie?" Katie whispered softly into her air as they moved together. "Sing for me?"</p>

<hr>

<p>Jessie pulled back her hand shaking her head slightly as she tried to get her hand to stop trembling. She didn't know why but she just couldn't stop tingling, it was as if every nerve ending in her body was on fire, and to her consternation she learned that that led to a loss of fine motor control. She'd been standing in front of the punch bowl trying to get a drink for over a minute now.</p>

<p>"That was quite a show," Jessie turned her head at the sound of the unfamiliar voice beside her. Her eyes focusing on the figure she soon recognized as Sarah Grasser. "You're a big woman on campus now aren't you?" Sarah continued when Jessie merely stared at her. "The newest thing. Katie's new hoola hoop."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Jessie said moving to take a step back. The last thing she wanted to do was talk to Sarah and her lemon juice thereby blighting her otherwise perfect night.</p>

<p>"You don't get it do you?" Sarah asked stepping in front of her effectively blocking her path.</p>

<p>"Move," Jessie said softly, her eyes meeting Sarah's. "Now."</p>

<p>"She's like a three year old. Always looking for some new, shiny toy … that she'll forget about three months later," Sarah continued holding Jessie's gaze and not moving so much as a centimeter. "She's like the sun, shining down on you, warming you until you think she'll always be there. But she won't, she'll go away and leave you shivering in the dark. It's her nature," she finished her head turning to the side, drawing Jessie's eyes with her to where a group of people who were gathered around Katie. Orbiting her.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about," Jessie said looking away and back over at Sarah. "She's not like that."</p>

<p>"Let me guess," Sarah started mockingly. "What you have together is special," she continued smiling coldly. "How did she do Sammler, huh? Poetry? Love letters?" Sarah went on, seeing Jessie's eyes flicker at the mention of love letters and smiling to herself. "Katouschka," she went on noting the look of jealously that flashed in Jessie's eyes at her use of her old nickname for Katie, "is a player. She only loves one thing, Katouschka. And if you don't think that you're going to end up being cast away into the land of misfit toys then you're not nearly as smart as everyone says you are." "T...that's not…" Jessie started, her words catching in her mouth before she could push them out. She could feel tears beginning to well in her eyes, and fought down the sick feeling in her stomach.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's going on?" Katie asked coming up behind the two, resting her hand on Jessie's shoulder as she looked between the two of them, not liking what she saw at all.</p>

<p>"Just chatting," Sarah responded smiling callously at Katie, her smile only growing when she saw Katie's eyes narrow with displeasure.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go find somebody else to talk to," Katie suggested, her voice a low grumble. She couldn't believe that this was the same girl she had been friend's with only months ago, she hardly recognized Sarah anymore, like the other girl had suddenly changed personalities one night leaving this imposter in place of her friend. It killed her that they had to fight like this, but she wasn't going to let Sarah abuse Jessie because of a mistake that she had made.</p>

<p>"What are you? Viceroy of Sammlerland?" Sarah asked arching an eyebrow at Katie. "She can't chose who she wants to talk to," she continued her eyes flittering over to Jessie. "Do you have to ask her permission to go to the washroom too?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you be off to see the Wizard? You know about that heart problem?" Katie asked her gaze practically causing Sarah's dress to start smoking. Sarah huffed in response, giving Katie and Jessie one last contemptuous look over before raising her head and walking away.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Katie asked as soon as Sarah was out of air shot, adjusting her position so that she could see Jessie's face.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Fine," Jessie replied straightening her shoulders, but Katie had spent enough time around her, watching her, to know that her response was utter crap.</p>

<p>"Alright," she responded carefully. "Then why don't we go get some fresh air?"</p>
