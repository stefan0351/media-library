<P>AN: I'm so so so sorry that it's been so long since I updated. I could give you excuses but it really doesn't make any difference. I made this chapter longer than any of my other ones in hopes that you will all forgive me. Thanks and I'm sorry.</P><P>(No POV)</P><P>Believe it or not, things really hadn't progressed since the magical kiss during laser tag. In fact, the lovesick pinning between the two had only increased. The easiest thing that Lori, Heather, or Carrie could do would be to tell Kate and Beth about their mutual feelings, but they all agreed that they shouldn't interfere in that aspect.  They were all convinced that they could get the two together without having to flat out tell them.</P><P>It's finally the end of the school year, all of the girls are getting ready for their semester tests on Monday. They only wished that they were seniors and would be graduating soon, but they are only juniors…too bad. John was graduating this year and all of the girls were thrilled. As far as they were concerned it was good riddance. Carrie and Kate decided that since they were the smarter of the four, they should split up and each study with one of the other girls. Carrie took Heather right away so that left Kate and Beth to study for their exams.</P><P>(Kate POV)</P><P>I can do this! I am bound and determined to help Beth pass all of her exams with flying colors. I have all weekend to help her learn the material. Studying really isn't hard, you just have to find a way to connect the material with something that interests you. My only worry is that I might not be able to connect with the thing that interests Beth the most…</P><P>(Beth POV)</P><P>So Kate is my tutor…could my luck be any better? She says that the key to studying is to find something that interests me and then connect it to the material. Oh Kate, I could tell you a lot of things that would interest me but they would all involve you and less clothing.  Wait a minute, maybe I could work this whole thing to my advantage.</P><P>If you couldn't tell, I've become a lot braver and way more confident since the kiss. Ever since we kissed, one of my dreams turned out to be true…her body reacts to me whether she likes it or not. Since then, I've noticed a lot of things that I missed before. For example, if I innocently brush up against her, she shivers. Don't get me wrong, my body reacts to her all the time, but I usually don't have to worry about it because she is so innocent and naïve.</P><P>One of the great things about our friendship is that we are both extremely touchy-feely people. So it's not out of the ordinary if I touch her or lean on her and same thing for her. I've been touching her a lot more lately but she doesn't seem to notice…I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.</P><P>(Carrie POV)</P><P>I am so smart…probably too smart for my own good. I was the one that suggested that we divide the girls up for studying. Kate and Beth don't know that Heather and I had studied a long time ago and we both know the material. Haha that leaves us with more time to spy on the two. I got some new gadgets recently and I'm super excited to use them.</P><P>"Heather, are you ready for this?" I ask her excitedly.</P><P>She throws her hair over her shoulder, "Psh of course…I was born ready."</P><P>I roll my eyes because she is so…Heather. I go to my closet and pull out the box with all of my equipment. I dump it on the floor in front of us and I laugh at Heather's shocked expression.</P><P>"Damn girl, compared to this…your boob-cam is sooo last year." She is still amazed while I separate it into different piles. She raises her eyebrows and laughs while I do this. I stop and look at her, "What?" She just laughs harder and finally says, "Did you really categorize your spy equipment."</P><P>I shoot her a glare and say, "There's nothing wrong with being organized. Just let it go Heather, we have more important things to worry about."</P><P>(Heather POV)</P><P>Wow I'm still laughin about that one…I mean I know how Carrie is but I think she just out-Carried herself.</P><P>"Okay, so the first thing is the hidden camera." She smiles brightly at me. I think for a minute, "But how are we gonna get that in Kate's room without her knowing it?" Her smile falls a little and she thinks, "I forgot that part…I've got it, we're gonna go over there and sneak into her room."</P><P>My only thought is that this could end very badly, but what the hell…no matter what it will be fun and I love adventure. I smile at her evilly and say, "Let's do it!" We high-five each other and then begin to put on the spy outfits.</P><P>Yes, you heard me right, spy outfits. They consist of black tights, ugly black shoes, a black turtleneck, a black beanie, and finally we put some black war paint on our faces. We could totally be the next James Bonds…no wait…Jane Bonds, YEAH!</P><P>(No POV)</P><P>Carrie and Heather quietly pull up to Kate's house. They make sure that they park a couple blocks down the road. They kill the engine and quietly close the car doors. Anyone watching would have found the scene in front of them hilarious, the girls were zigzagging, running, and crawling between various trees before finally flattening against the side of Kate's house.</P><P>They gave each other a nod and ran for the tree outside of Kate's window.  They start climbing up the tree to see if the girls are in Kate's room or not. Luck was not in their favor tonight because the girls were studying and laughing. They jump down from the tree.</P><P>Carrie looks at Heather and says, "Okay, I need you to create a distraction that causes them to come outside while I set up the camera in Kate's room."</P><P>Heather sends Carrie a panicked look before saying, "What kind of distraction? What should I do?"</P><P>Carrie rolls her eyes at Heather before saying sarcastically, "Gee I don't know, maybe you should run around naked and try to get their attention…after all they do bat for the other team."</P><P>Heather glares at her and says, "Strip…seriously? Gah Carrie I'm not Beth…she's the slut." Both girls bust out laughing before splitting up.</P><P>(Beth POV)</P><P>We actually haven't gotten much studying done because of the constant laughing. Well, that and the fact that I can't stop staring at her.</P><P>"So Tutor Girl, how much material did we learn this semester?" I'm almost afraid of the answer she's gonna give me.</P><P>She stops and looks at me, "Tutor Girl? Seriously? You've been watching way too much One Tree Hill."</P><P>There is no such thing. I give her a shocked look, "Oh please, you know you love OTH just as much as I do."</P><P>She smiles at me, "Well duh, it is the best show ever!"</P><P>We both laugh for a while before I decide to kick it up a notch. "K. Spencer, hoes over bros?" I laugh while putting out my fist.</P><P>She rolls her eyes and pounds my fist, "Hoes over bros. But first I'm Haley, now I'm Peyton? Who am I gonna be next? Lucas?"</P><P>I simply smirk and say, "Lucas, huh? Well, do you want to be my Broody?" I'm flirting with her big time right now.</P><P>She flashes me a grin, "Only if you'll be my Pretty Girl." Wow, major flirt points for her. I can only nod because she's got me hypnotized. You don't know how much I want that, Kate.</P><P>We sit in a comfortable silence until she breaks it, "Oh and I find it funny that you stayed Brooke in all of our OTH comparisons.</P><P>I fake shock with her, "Of course I stayed Brooke, she is hot, sexy, and amazing."</P><P>Kate raises an eyebrow, "You only say that about Brooke because you look just like Sophia Bush." Oh, busted! I smile guiltily at her before sheepishly nodding.</P><P>I don't know how we got so far off track. We've been heavily discussing OTH for the last 30 minutes and studying is the farthest thing on our minds. She stops mid sentence when we both hear a tortured noise coming from outside…it sounds like a dying cat.</P><P>(Heather POV)</P><P>"Meow," I say for the sixth time. I didn't have any better ideas, which is why I am currently hiding in Kate's backyard making cat noises like an idiot. I hear the back door open and I am praying that Carrie is setting up the camera. How long did she say it would take? Oh right, she left that minor detail out! Oh shit, they're searching the yard. I remain as quiet as possible.</P><P>"Maybe it came from your neighbors yard." Beth points out.</P><P>Kate thinks for a minute, "It could have but that cat sounded like it was in agony. We should try and find it so that we can make sure it's okay. I know how you are Beth, if there's even the slightest thought that this animal is hurt, it'll bother you all night."</P><P>Aww, that's so cute. Maybe these two really do belong together. They keep up this charade of looking while I casually change my hiding place every so often. I can't help but notice they way they look at one another when they think the other isn't looking. These two really are helplessly and head over heals in LOVE!</P><P>All of a sudden, Kate's phone starts going off in her bedroom. The girls both turn to leave and I can only hope that it was Carrie that sent them the text. Once they are in the house I run to the tree by Kate's window. Uh oh….no sign of Carrie. I start to climb the tree and peek inside Kate's window. The girls are back in Kate's room but nothing seems to be out of the ordinary.</P><P>I get a text from Carrie…it says, "I'M IN THE CLOSET OMG THIS IS SO SCARY! DO SOMETHING!" I continue to brainstorm, not quite sure what I should do.</P><P>(Carrie POV)</P><P>Oh no.  What do I do? Think Carrie, think. I just sent Heather a text, I hope she can get me out of this jam. While I'm thinking I hear Kate suggest that they go and get something to eat. Thank you Lord, maybe luck is on our side today.</P><P>They leave the room and I bolt for the window. I'm in the process of climbing down the tree when I accidentally hit Heather. Why is she in the tree? Anyways the force causes us both to fall out onto the ground.  Wow that actually didn't hurt that bad. Why was my landing so soft?</P><P>"Ugh. Carrie get off me. We so need to be getting paid for this." Oh shit, I landed right on Heather…poor girl. I scramble off of her and we hobble back to the car.</P><P>Once we arrive in my room I set up the monitors and work on getting the feed from the hidden camera. I smile at her, "Mission accomplished."</P><P>She smiles back, "The secret service should totally hire us." We're still waiting for it to work. That's funny…it's never taken this long before. Wait, something is definitely wrong here.</P><P>I groan loudly, "If they did hire us, we would so be fired. I forgot to turn the damn thing on."</P><P>She shoots a glare at me. Wow, if looks could kill, I would so be six feet under. "Maybe we weren't meant to interfere after all."</P><P>I raise my eyebrow, "Oh please, this is just a case of bad luck. We can figure out a new plan after we take these tests on Monday."</P><P>She laughs, "Sounds good to me. So, do ya wanna rent a movie?"</P><P>I think for a minute, "Sure, why not? It's not like we can spy on anyone tonight anyways."</P><P>AN: So if you couldn't tell…I'm a major One Tree Hill fan and I had to incorporate it somehow. Sorry again for it being so long since I updated. Comment and review. Until next time.</P>
