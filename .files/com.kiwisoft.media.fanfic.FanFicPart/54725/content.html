<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 22: Graduation - Part 2-->

<p>The Mayor stood in Faith's apartment, looking out the broken window. Two vampires were with him, frantically searching around trying to find any trace of Buffy or Faith.</P>
<p>"There's nobody here." A vampire said.</P>
<p>"No." The Mayor turned around and started to walk towards the bed. "Why would she take the fight outside? My Faith doesn't like to be cooped up. Find them."</P>
<p>"But sir, the Ascen -"</P>
<p>"Find them!" He yelled. They scrambled out of the apartment. The Mayor looked and sounded like he had snapped. "Faith's a good girl. She can handle anything they throw at her. She'll be all right…she'll be all right…she'll be all right."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy had taken a ladder down off the roof and to the ground. The shock at what had happened to Faith got lost in her need to save Giles. She noticed the small vial on the roof, and quickly swiped it, leaving just as the Mayor and his helpers had arrived at the apartment.</P>
<p>She ran as fast as her legs would take her, her adrenaline pumping, all the way to the hospital. By the time she made it up the three flights of stairs, and to Giles' room, she was panting. Her mother was sitting in a chair at the side of the bed, and got up quickly, as she saw her daughter.</P>
<p>"Buff-"</P>
<p>"How is he? Where's the doctor?"</P>
<p>"Breathe honey. The doctor said the paralysis has moved up to his chest. The pain has lessened, but it's sped up. They don't think -"</P>
<p>"I have the cure. I need to give it to him."</P>
<p>"What? Are you sure?"</P>
<p>"No, but what other chance has he got? Is the doctor coming back soon?"</P>
<p>"Any second."</P>
<p>"Okay, listen mom. I need you to leave town."</P>
<p>"But I'd miss your graduation."</P>
<p>"That's pretty much the plan. It'll be too dangerous, and I don't know what's gonna happen."</P>
<p>"I'm not going to leave you to face -"</P>
<p>"You stay, you'll get me killed. I have to do this, and I'll feel better knowing you're safe. Please trust me on this."</P>
<p>Joyce was trying to find something else to say, but she couldn't. The look of determination faded, and her face softened.</P>
<p>"You come back me, you understand?" She was determined not to cry.</P>
<p>"I will, mom. I promise."</P>
<p>"I love you, Buffy."</P>
<p>"I love you too. Now go. And hurry."</P>
<p>Joyce nodded, and left her daughter alone with Giles.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Ideas, ideas…" Willow wondered aloud to everyone in the library. She wanted to go to the hospital and see Giles. She wanted to find Buffy. But she needed to concentrate. If Buffy was helping Giles, that meant she had to, they had to, work on the Ascension.</P>
<p>If they didn't, they'd all be dead and all their efforts for Giles would have been for nothing.</P>
<p>"Well, we know what he's…" Cordelia started.</P>
<p>"A really, really, really, really, big…" Xander continued.</P>
<p>"Might wanna add a few more ' really 's in there." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Snake-thing." Willow said. "How do we kill him?"</P>
<p>"Poison mice. Snakes eat mice." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Sure that'd work. Maybe if we could get a couple billion." Xander said sarcastically. Cordelia eyed him. "Can I talk to you?"</P>
<p>She didn't respond for a second, and then nodded slowly, and they went into the office.</P>
<p>"What about you, Oz?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"We attack the Mayor with humus. He'll never see it coming."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Okay," Xander began, "what I said to you before, was wrong."</P>
<p>"How wrong?"</P>
<p>"At the extreme end of the wrong scale. I wasn't thinking."</P>
<p>"That's a shocker."</P>
<p>"I deserve any remark you throw at me right now, but…I didn't mean what I said. It kinda sounded like you were making an excuse to leave me and I know all about the horror stories of guys who have been dumped by you, and…"</P>
<p>"Is there a point to this?"</P>
<p>"I'm sorry. I really am."</P>
<p>Cordelia was being cautious. Should she believe him? Let herself get sucked in again? "You mean it?"</P>
<p>"I've never been more serious. And that's the truth."</P>
<p>She studied his face as she walked closer to him. He didn't appear to be lying. She hugged him. Didn't kiss him, though. No, then it would be too hard to leave.</P>
<p>"Do you understand why I have to go?"</P>
<p>"I'm getting there. Just don't disappear forever, okay?" </P>
<p>"No, I won't. I've got friends to come back to."</P>
<p>Xander smiled at her, and she smiled back. They left the office just as Willow exclaimed, "I've got a plan!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy was arguing with the doctor. She wouldn't let her put the solution in the vial, into Giles' IV.</P>
<p>"I have no idea what this substance is, or where it came from. Maybe if you knew what it was it would be different. If you let me run some tests -"</P>
<p>"He doesn't have time for tests! This could be his only shot!"</P>
<p>"He could also die from it."</P>
<p>"He's already dying! And if this could have saved him -"</P>
<p>The doctor's pager beeped. "There's a new arrival coming up from the ER. Just…don't…" She lost her train of thought as she ran from the room.</P>
<p>Buffy looked directly at Giles face. She leaned over him, and grabbed his hand.</P>
<p>"Giles I need you to listen, okay? I know it's getting harder for you, but you've gotta help me out here. See you're…well, you probably know by now. I got this little vial from Faith. I killed her for it, Giles. I killed a person for something that might not even work.</P>
<p>"But it has to. I'm not going to let you die. The doctor…she doesn't want to use this…even though it may save your life." She started to plead now, crying freely, blurring her vision. "I need you tell me you're okay with this. Just tell me I can use it, and that's all I need. You don't want to leave me, do you? You promised remember? So give me something, anything. Please."</P>
<p>In the background, she could hear people scrambling to get a patient into the bed next door, but she was blocking it all out. After a few seconds, when her hope was fading, she felt his hand squeeze hers. Very weakly, but she could feel it.</P>
<p>"I'll take that as a yes."</P>
<p>She rushed over to his IV bag, and uncorked the vial. She needed a syringe. She went over to the desk against the wall, and searched the main drawer.</P>
<I><P>'Found it.'</P>
</I><P>She tore off the paper covering, and opened the tube end of the syringe. She poured all the liquid from the vial in and sealed it back up. She injected the syringe's contents into the IV's rubber bung. She watched it mix with the sugars and the nutrients, and watched it travel down the tube, into his arm, and into his blood stream.</P>
<p>She didn't see or hear the person behind her, but she felt the hit on the back of her head. She collapsed and turned to see the Mayor reach down for her. He grabbed her by the neck, and dragged her to the next room.</P>
<p>Faith was in the bed. Her face bruised, red splotches all over, and she was pale. The doctors had gone. She was on life support, and there was nothing more they could do. She was in a coma and had a good deal of brain damage. It was near impossible that she would ever wake up.</P>
<p>"Do you see what you did to my Faith?" He seethed through clenched teeth, pulling her closer. Buffy made no attempt to struggle.</P>
<p>"I'm sorry."</P>
<p>"Oh, you'll have to do better than that young lady. You're a killer now. How does it feel? Cold blooded murder, Miss Summers, and you will pay."</P>
<p>He dragged her back into Giles' room.</P>
<p>"And we'll start with your mentor. Are you close?"</P>
<p>"You don't wanna do that."</P>
<p>"Oh it's only the beginning. Then I'll kill you. And your friends. And I'll eat you."</P>
<p>"There's one problem with that." She said, using both her arms to elbow him in the chest. "You're still human." She kicked him into the window, and he chuckled.</P>
<p>"And I'm still invincible. No matter." The orderlies ran into the room. "It's only a few hours away. Better get ready. You wanna look nice for the occasion, don't you?"</P>
<p>He strolled casually out of the room, and one of the orderlies became frantic. Buffy looked at Giles, who had begun to move.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"So, what do you think?" Willow asked her friends.</P>
<p>"I've heard worse plans." Xander said. "I could get in though."</P>
<p>"It seems more effective then Oz's plan anyway." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Humus is deadlier then people think." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Well, we'll use that as a back up. I just have to see what Buffy thinks." The phone rang, and Willow quickly picked it up. "Buffy! Thank God, you're okay…He is? Yeah, we'll be there. K, Bye." She hung up, and headed to the door.</P>
<p>"They're okay!" Willow said happily.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Giles were talking. The doctor marveled at his recovery. The feeling had nearly returned to his entire body. He wasn't ready to walk yet, and he was still really tired, but Buffy had saved him just in time.</P>
<p>"I was so worried that I was too late." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Yes I think I owe you a good deal of thanks."</P>
<P> 	"You don't owe me anything, Giles." She looked down at her lap.</P>
<p>"Why are you being so hard on yourself, I never lost faith in…"</P>
<p>She choked trying to hold back the laugh that wanted to come out. She stood up, and pulled back the curtain that allowed them to see into the next room. Giles turned his head, and saw Faith lying there.</P>
<p>"I did that to her. She could be like that forever."</P>
<p>"Buffy I…"</P>
<p>"I had no choice, right? I mean at least it wasn't for nothing. You're fine, and you're gonna get better and…"	</P>
<p>She trailed off as the gang entered the room.</P>
<p>"Hey, G-man! You had us worried for awhile. When they letting you out of this joint?" Xander said immediately.</P>
<p>"I wanted to get balloons and a little bear for you, but…" Willow said to him.</P>
<p>"It's perfectly all right, Willow. However, I will hold you to that."</P>
<p>"Full recovery, right?" She asked. He nodded. "I'm glad."</P>
<p>She turned to Buffy, who looked directly at her. After a moment of silence, Buffy hugged her tightly.</P>
<I><p>'Thank God you're here. I need you here.'</P>
</I><p>Willow looked at Buffy's face, understood, and then pulled her into a hug again. After a few more moments they turned and faced Giles.</P>
<p>"Have you made any progress on the Ascension?" He asked.</P>
<p>"Ooh, yeah! Here's the plan…"</P>
<p></P>
<hr width=100>

<p>In his office, the Mayor was giving last minute instructions to his group of vampire fighters.</P>
<p>"No snacking. Just kill. Feeding is crucial in the opening minutes to sustain the change.  Remember, fast and brutal. It's gonna be a whole new world come nightfall. Don't wanna weaken now. And boys? Let's watch the swearing?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"It could work." Buffy said, smiling at Willow. "But if it's gonna happen we need to move and we need to move now. Xander, Oz, get the stuff. Willow, Cordelia get the people."</P>
<p>"Let's not forget that it's standard in an Ascension for an eclipse. Vampires will be a factor also." Giles said.</P>
<p>"I factored that in too." Willow said.</P>
<P> 	"Then I suppose -"</P>
<p>"No, don't even think about it, Giles. You're staying right here. You just got your life back, and I'm not gonna let you risk it. You need rest." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"You're right, I just wish I could be there."</P>
<p>"We'll think of you. If we're not too busy." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Thank you, Cordelia."</P>
<p>"Let's move out." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Army base here we come." Xander said.</P>
<p>They walked out, and Buffy and Giles looked at each other one last time.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy got about five steps down the hallway, when she stopped in front of Faith's door. Willow jogged back to her.</P>
<p>"You coming?" She asked.</P>
<p>"One minute?"</P>
<p>"I'll wait for you downstairs."</P>
<p>Willow walked away, and Buffy entered Faith's room. She looked at her damaged face, and wondered if it would heal, or if the brain damage was as extensive as she was told. She shook it off, and leaned down.</P>
<p>She kissed Faith's forehead, and started to lean up again, when she thought she heard her. But her eyes weren't open, and her mouth hadn't moved. Then she heard it again. It was faint, but she could make out two simple words: 'Kill him'.</P>
<p>She would.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Thank God Giles already packed his books." Willow said later at the library.</P>
<p>Larry, Oz, Jonathan, and Xander were bringing in the last bags, and stacked them in the corner.</P>
<p>"Is that it?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"It's enough to do this several times." Oz said.</P>
<p>Cordelia walked in. "We're all set."</P>
<p>"Okay, thanks guys." Buffy said to Larry and Jonathan. "We have about forty-five minutes till the ceremony. You should get situated."</P>
<p>They left, and the gang was left alone in the library. Their gowns and caps were on the library table. They all went to grab them, and all helped each other zip them up. Willow grabbed Buffy's cap, and situated it on her head.</P>
<p>"This is it." Willow said. "We're gonna do it."</P>
<p>"If you think we are, then we are." Buffy kissed her, and turned to Xander. "I'm counting on you to coordinate."</P>
<p>"I won't let you down, Buff."</P>
<p>She grabbed Faith's knife off the table. It was still covered with blood.</P>
<p>"Let's graduate."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>It was time. The students were sitting in the yard, parents off to the side, and Snyder was at the podium.</P>
<p>"And now a special guest speaker, Richard Wilkins III."</P>
<p>The Mayor stepped up to the podium, and looked to the students.</P>
<p>"Well, what a day this is. A special day. Today is our centennial. The 100th anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale, and I know what that means to all you kids. Not a darn thing. Cause today, something much more important happens. Today you all graduate from high school.</P>
<P>"Today all the pain, all the work, all the excitement, is finally over. Now what's a hundred years of history compared to that?"</P>
<P>"My God, he's gonna do the entire speech." Buffy said to Willow, who was sitting next to her.</P>
<P>"Man just ascend already."</P>
<P>"Evil."</P>
<p>He had been talking still. "It's been a long road getting here. For you, for Sunnydale. There's been achievement, and joy, and good times. And there's been grief, there's been loss. Some people who should be here today," He looked at Buffy, "aren't.  But we are. </P>
<P>"Journey's end. What is a journey? Is it just distance traveled? Time spent? No. It's what happens on the way. It's the things that shape you. At the end of the journey, you're not the same. Today is about change.</P>
<P>"Graduation doesn't just mean y our circumstances change,  it means you do. You ascend, to a higher level. Nothing will ever be the same. Nothing." He cringed down in pain. The changes were beginning. And the students started to look around. Especially at the now blocked out sun. </P>
<P>"And so, as we look back on the events that have brought us to this day, we...must all..." He screamed. "It has begun. My destiny. It's a little sooner then I expected. I had this whole section on civic pride, but I guess we'll just skip to the big finish." </P>
<p>His skin, his clothes, they all tore. His body contorted, and changed, and face started to become more reptilian. Finally, he shed his human skin, and took on a demonic snake-like form. He was sixty feet long, and his huge mouth opened, and roared, animalistic and raw.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The students watched the demon snake Mayor and he eyed them. The parents were trying to rush out of the courtyard as fast as possible. Buffy yelled in the midst of her class.</P>
<P>"Now!"</P>
<P>They threw off their gowns and caps to reveal hidden assortments of weaponry. Bows and arrows, maces, axes, swords, from Giles stockpile of weapons; and flame-throwers care of the local army regiment, and Xander's soldier memories.</P>
<P>"Flame units!" Buffy called out.</P>
<P>The front line raised their flame-throwers, and pointed them at the demon snake. </P>
<P>"First wave! Fire!" Xander directed.</P>
<P>The flames burst out, and distracted the demon, but their efforts appeared only to agitate it. They continued this way, wave after wave of fire, doing their best to hold it off until the right time. They didn't go unpunished though. The snake quickly ate a young girl, and side swiped Larry with his tail, sending him flying in the air, and snapping his neck.</P>
<P>From behind all the students, the Mayor's vampires came forward towards the unsuspecting kids. Oz turned around sharply, and saw them coming.</P>
<P>"Xander!" He yelled.</P>
<P>"Bow men!"</P>
<P>The guys in the back row turned around, and were all armed with flame-tipped arrows. Some hit their mark instantly torching some vampires. Some didn't, and the remaining still came forward. Off to the side, a group holding stakes and crosses, led by Cordelia, went to face off with the vampires.</P>
<P>Still over on the stage, Snyder was yelling up to the demon snake Mayor. Buffy watched, wide-eyed.</P>
<P>"This is not orderly! This is not disciplined! You're on my campus, buddy, and when I -" He was cut off when the snake dipped down, and ate him.</P>
<P>"Fall back!" She yelled to everyone.</P>
<P>Back by the vampires, Cordelia successfully staked one, however, they weren't going to last much longer.</P>
<P>"Go! Get to the -" Buffy said to Willow.</P>
<p>Willow nodded. "Good luck!" She ran off, and Buffy went to get closer to the snake.</P>
<P>"Xander! Take 'em down!"</P>
<P>"Hand to hand!" Xander yelled.</P>
<p>The rest of the students dropped their weapons, and they all converged on the vampires. Buffy ran directly beneath the snake, and made sure it saw the bloody knife in her hand.</P>
<P>"Hey! You remember this? I took it from Faith. Stuck it in her gut. Just slit it in her like she was butter. Wanna get it back from me? Dick?" </P>
<P>She took off into the school, and it followed. It crashed through the wall, and in through the cafeteria, through the hallways, and lounge. Buffy kept ahead of it, and went through the doors of the library and out the window on the far side.</P>
<P>She ran out, and stumbled by the bushes, where Willow was waiting to push down on a trigger. She did, and inside, the bags of explosives in the library blew up, engulfing the once Mayor, and the entire school in flames.</P>
<P>They watched, transfixed for a moment, and then got up.</P>
<P>"Who would have thought I, me, would be the one to blow up the school?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"I knew you had it in you." Buffy said.</P>
<P>They wrapped their arms around one another's shoulders, and went to find their friends and fellow graduates.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"I have to admit. I'll miss the library." Giles said, later. They were all in his house and it was the day after the explosion. The fire trucks and policemen were there through the night, and no one would tell them anything. On some level, the police were glad to remain ignorant of the situation.</P>
<P>"I know I will." Willow said.</P>
<P>"We all will. Of course we never used it for the traditional reason. Well, not me anyway." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"It's your option. Freedom of choice is cool thing." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Yes, choosing illiteracy is a wise choice." Giles said with a hint of sarcasm.</P>
<p>"Are you sure they didn't knock something loose in the hospital? That seemed to almost be a sarcastic remark at my expense." </P>
<p>"Quite possibly."</P>
<p>Xander came in just then, and walked over to his friends.</P>
<p>"She's gone." He said.</P>
<p>"Are you okay?" Buffy and Willow asked at the same time.</P>
<p>He grinned at them. "Yeah, I am. I'll miss her, but she promised to call once she got settled. And maybe I can even visit."</P>
<p>They smiled at him.</P>
<p>"Oh, Xander?" Giles asked.</P>
<p>"Yeah, Giles?"</P>
<p>"I just wanted to clarify something. Inbreeding and hemophilia were most common among the royal courtiers of centuries ago. Not in this modern era or among the modern everyday British population. And it wasn't just English royalty. It was also the Germans, the Russians; well you get the idea. The next time you wish to make a jibe at my country, try to be better informed."</P>
<p>Xander stood there, dumbfounded.</P>
<p>"You know I've learned a very valuable lesson." Oz said.</P>
<p>"That good eventually triumphs over evil?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"That town names are misleading? Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Never mess with a Brit."</P>
<p>"That's an important lesson too." Sometimes Buffy just couldn't understand Oz. </P>
<p>They all stared at the speechless Xander for another minute, before Buffy turned to Willow.</P>
<p>"Let's go do something fun. I've got three months until college, and I intend on wasting every second of it."</P>
<p>"But we…prepare…" Willow began to protest.</P>
<p>Buffy picked her up. "You are not thinking about college right now are you?"</P>
<p>"Well…"</P>
<p>She kissed Willow long and sweetly. "Are you?"</P>
<p>Willow wrapped her arms around Buffy's neck. "Strangely, not anymore."</P>
<p>"That's what I thought." Willow started to reach her fingers for the side of Buffy's neck. "Please, no."</P>
<p>"Why not?"</P>
<p>"Do you want me to drop you?"</P>
<p>She thought it over. "I'll risk it." Buffy was extremely ticklish. She started to laugh, and was trying to keep her balance. "Big Bad Slayer can't stay up? Come on, you gotta carry me."</P>
<p>Buffy practically stumbled to the door, and had to turn so Willow could reach the knob to open it.</P>
<p>"Good job. You passed."</P>
<p>"What do I get?"</P>
<p>"You'll have to carry me home to see."</P>
<p>"Rosenberg, sometimes I don't know why I put up with you. Remind me quick."</P>
<p>"Cause I'm so loveable, silly."</P>
<p>"Oh yeah."</P>
<p>They walked out the door, and the three left in house, stared after them in amazement.</P>
<p>"They certainly are unique." Giles said.</P>
<p>"No…" Oz started.</P>
<p>"They're two of a kind." Xander finished.</P>
