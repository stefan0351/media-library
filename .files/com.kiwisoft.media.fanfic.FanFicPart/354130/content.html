<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 42 -->

<p>Sam rubbed at her eyes wearily, letting out a tired sigh.  She didn't
even need to look at herself to know that she had heavy bags under
her eyes, and that she probably looked as bad as she felt.  To call
the previous night hell, would have been an understatement of epic
proportions.  Hell never looked so good.  The entire evening had been
marked by an oppressive, terse silence.  Anxiousness pervaded their
every movement, indeed, by the end of the night it seemed to Sam as
if the furniture was becoming uncomfortable as well.  And, when she
arrived in the room she was to share with her mother — for who knew
how long — things only got worse.  They hardly spoke to each other,
and when they did it was cumbersome and ungainly, as if they had been
strained on a desert island for years and had become unaccustomed to
conversing with human beings — halting, and stuttering and stumbling
about.  There had been as ease, a flow to their relationship with
other, Jane treating Sam with a respect and comfort that Sam had
always appreciated and considered to be quite rare.  That harmony
which had characterized their relationship with each other had been
disrupted now, polarized, until Sam hardly recognized it.  When she
got up in the night to go to the washroom and was questioned by her
mother like it was the Spanish Inquisition, she realized what had
changed.  The trust Jane had always had in her was gone, that
intrinsic belief that she knew who her daughter, shattered.  Sam felt
like a stranger to Jane, and she was beginning to feel like a
stranger to herself.</p>

<p>"We have to form a unified front."  Sam blinked and turned her head
to the side.  It was Brooke.  She had almost forgotten that the
blonde was standing there.</p>

<p>"It's breakfast, not the invasion of Normandy," Sam responded.  If
she had worn glasses she would have taken that opportunity to take
them off and clean them, staring into the translucent surface
thoughtfully. </p>

<p>"This is not just breakfast.  Certainly it's breakfast, but it's not
JUST breakfast.  This is the breakfast to end all breakfasts," Brooke
responded tensely.  Sam looked over at her thoughtfully.  The blonde
was paler than usually, her features tightly drawn, her lips forming
a thin line.  She looked older and, Sam thought, distinguished.
Angst was a look Brooke wore well, wore with dignity Sam decided.
Still, she would have washed every trace of it away without the
slightest hesitation, if she could have.</p>

<p>"Maybe we should come up with a secret handshake, or buy matching
decoder rings," Sam responded a moment later.  Uniforms, and secret
rituals always made people seem more impressive than they actually
were.  Brooke glanced over at her but didn't respond to her
verbally.  Instead she took her bottom lip between her teeth, biting
down softly and stared out the window with slightly hooded eyes.</p>

<p>"Your mom likes eggs benedict," the blonde said a moment later her
voice curling as she spoke the last part making the whole sentence
sound like a question.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded nodding her head.  "And your dad likes grits,"
she added a moment later.  They had prepared both of those dishes
earlier on, with an impressive swiftness.  Was it as a bribe?  A
peace offering?  A prostitution?  They didn't know, they only knew
that at the time, in the silence, in the dark of the early morning,
it seemed like a good thing to do.</p>

<p>"It won't make a difference will it?" Brooke asked releasing her lip
and turning to face Sam.</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded.  "I don't expect that it will."</p>

<p>"I think," Brooke began, then stopped.  She was quiet for a moment,
looking down at her feet, her lip back between her teeth being gnawed
at once again.  "I think," she said starting once again, apparently
having regained her train of thought, "that I had convinced myself
that things would be different when they found out.  You know, like
one of those dream sequences in soap operas where everyone smiles and
hugs, and rose petals fall from above, and a rainbow appears even
though there isn't a cloud in the sky."  She sounded damaged, like a
ten year old who had just been told that there was no Santa Claus.
Sounding terribly trite even to herself Sam thought, we're not in
Kansas anymore.</p>

<p>"That's why I live mostly in my mind," is what the brunette said out-
loud however.  She had wanted to say something comforting, something
that would make it all go away, something that could give Brooke her
rainbow, but there wasn't anything she could say that could do that.
This was the reality of the situation, and they had spent perhaps
their entire relationship ignoring it.</p>

<p>Brooke was about to respond when the clicking of shoes on the tile of
the floor brought her attention to the doorway.  Sam followed her
gaze and they both watched as their parents entered the kitchen.
Their faces were as still as stone.  Brooke opened her mouth to
speak, she had pre-planned what she was going to say to them when
they entered the kitchen, it was witty and charming, the perfect ice-
breaker or hostility disarmer.  It was suppose to make them laugh
easily, and then stop and think about the banality of the situation,
the utter ridiculousness of it, and bring them to a new
understanding, the rising sun shining brightly through the kitchen
window warming them all.  The reality was that almost as soon as she
opened her mouth she closed it again and bit her lip once more, not
emoting a word or a sound.</p>

<p>They took their seats.</p>

<p>Mike pinched the bridge of his nose, and sighed deeply.  Jane rubbed
her bottom lip with her thumb mutely, her eyes focused on her plate.
Sam sat with her fork poised over her plate, the utensil shuddering
minutely because of the trembling of her hand.  Brooke sat still,
except for her hands, which took off and replaced the ring with wore
on her right repeatedly, her skin chaffing slightly under the assault.</p>

<p>The clock ticked noisily in the background.  They still had thirty
minutes before they could politely remove themselves from each others
company.</p>
