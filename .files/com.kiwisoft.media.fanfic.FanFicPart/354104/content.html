<!-- Well, This Happened \ Interlude: “Before Night Falls” -->

<p>Brooke gasped as Sam slid her hands under her shirt, moaning as the brunette
began to vigorously explore the rapidly heating flesh she found there.
Brooke raised her hands up to Sam’s face holding her steady as she rained
desperate kiss after desperate kiss all over Sam’s face.  They had been
living in a world that consisted of sexual frustration, sexual frustration,
and sexual frustration, and after their outing the previous night at the
club the stewing pot had boiled over.</p>

<p>Responding to the urgency in Brooke’s movements Sam pushed forward into the
other girl causing Brooke to step back again and again until her legs bumped
against the edge of her bed sending her and Sam tumbling down onto the
pliant mattress and soon to be discarded covers.</p>

<p>“Thank the lord for annual check-ups,” Brooke mumbled as she turned them
over so that she was straddling Sam’s waist.  “With honorable mention going
to the never-ending waiting line,” she continued pulling her top over her
head, impatiently throwing it somewhere behind her.</p>

<p>Sam smiled up at her, then brought her hands up to Brooke’s face bringing
the blonde’s head down until their lips crashed together.  As Sam continued
to ravage her lips as Brooke shifted her position so that she was draped
over the brunette’s body, groaning into Sam’s mouth as the journalist
slipped her thigh between Brooke’s legs.  Pressing down on the newly offered
surface, Brooke whimpered drawing her mouth away from Sam’s, burying her
face in the other girls neck, licking and nipping at the skin she found
there as she rocked against Sam’s leg with an almost primal urgency.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s…” Sam started to say.</p>

<p>“If you say horny, I’ll kill you,” Brooke muttered into the brunettes ear.
She made ceased her actions as she began to speak, but some involuntary
shudders still ran through her body as she tried to get her breathing under
control.</p>

<p>“I was going to say eager,” Sam responded smiling.  “We’ve got hours,” she
continued in voice that was considerably huskier than usual.</p>

<p>“That’s easy for you to say.  I know what you were doing during that
marathon shower you took this morning,”  Brooke responded raising her head
and looking down at Sam with a crooked smile on her face.  As her gaze
traveled down to rest on one of Sam’s hands, one could even describe the
expression on her face as a leer, if one were so inclined.</p>

<p>Sam stared at her for a moment, opening her mouth as if to protest Brooke’s
allusion, but her lips soon curved up into a playful grin, a flush traveling
over her body, covering her skin.  “Okay, so there was that,” she responded
slyly, watching with hooded eyes as Brooke’s sky blue eyes turned a stormy
gray upon hearing the admission.  “Since you’re so interested … in my
personal grooming routine,” Sam continued teasingly, “I could give you a
demonstration” Sam offered watching Brooke carefully, reveling in her
reactions.  This statement was accompanied by the blonde sucking in a deep
breath and shuddering slightly.  Sam took this to mean that Brooke wanted
her to proceed with her tutorial and wasted no time trailing her hands up
Brooke’s thighs until they came to rest on the blonde’s waist.  From there
she pushed softly shifting their bodies so that they were both laying on
their sides, face to face.  In this position she leaned forward bringing
their lips together while simultaneously running her fingers across Brooke’s
stomach, her nails scrapping across the pale skin until she reached the
waist band of Brooke’s pants.  Sliding her body up slightly, Sam then
slipped her hand down the front of Brooke’s pants.  Brooke moaned and moved
forward into Sam’s hand wantonly.</p>

<p>And they were lost.</p>

<p>Sam  ran her fingers through the silky softness of Brooke’s hair.  The
blondes head was resting on her shoulder, and Sam could feel the warmth of
her breath warming the skin just above where the textbooks said her heart
lay.  “I had the strangest dream last night,” she said into the stillness of
the room.  She felt Brooke shift against, her body ‘saying continue, please,
I’m on eggshells’ as it rubbed against Sam’s.  “It was dark out, and you and
I were laying in the whitest sand you’ve ever seen.  There were tiny pink
speckles in it, but it didn’t take away from the effect, in fact they just
made it all the more amazing.  Your head was resting on my shoulder, like it
is now, and I was looking up at the stars.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound strange,” Brooke said softly.  “It sounds idyllic.”
There was a wistful quality to her voice, as if she had transported herself
into the dream as Sam spoke, and was herself laying on the tropical beach in
the brunettes arms.</p>

<p>“I was…until I saw something shoot across the sky,” Sam responded.  She
could feel Brooke tracing her finger across her stomach, lightly drawing
imaginary shapes on her skin.  It was something Sam had come to expect from
the blonde, a post-coital ritual of sorts, and it always made her heart skip
a beat.  “Soon after the that I saw another streak, and then another and
another.  Then, the sky was filled with these blazing orange streaks.  All
around us it was raining these fiery orbs.  We got scared and stood up,
where we watched those fist sized balls of fire crashing down into the
ocean.  We started looking for a place to run, to hide, but there was no
place to go.  We were on an empty island, just us, a palm tree and the sand.
  We were so scared, but when we saw that there was no place to go, we just
kind of stood there together, watching.  And soon we noticed that none of
the rocks were landing on the island, like it was a sacred place.”  Brooke
stopped her motions, now drawing her arms around Sam, hugging the brunette
to her body soothingly.  “I moved closer to you and you and you wrapped your
arms around me and the shower started to slow.  Soon after that it stopped
completely, and all around us was calm again.  We lay back down; the only
change from the beginning of the dream was the air.  It was balmy.”</p>

<p>“I could listen to you forever,” Brooke said a moment later.  “I would,
gladly.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” Sam responded looking down at the blonde head covering her
chest, her tone droll yet gentle.  “I have a lot to say.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Brooke asked, freeing one of her hands to trail down Sam’s body
slowly, coming to rest on her knee where she fingered the scar she had
discovered weeks — or was is months? — ago .  “Tell me how you go this?”</p>

<p>Sam tilted her head back, her eyes roaming the ceiling, deep in thought.
“My bike,” she said finally, having tracked down the memory and gripped it
firmly.  “I had gotten Harrison to steal his Dad’s double head screwdriver
and take the training wheels off of it.  I got on the newly bipedal
instrument immediately, and for about five seconds every thing was going off
without a hitch.  It was beautiful.  I turned around to gloat, this turned
out to be my downfall,” Sam intoned gravely.  “I lost control of the bike
and toppled over.  Sam fall down go boom.  I must have cut my knee on some
part of the bike, maybe on something on the sidewalk, I was never really
sure what did it.”</p>

<p>“I want to know the history of your body, every scar, every scratch, every
crevice from head to toe,” Brooke related when Sam finished speaking.</p>

<p>Sam turned around in the circle of Brooke’s arms.  She leaned forward and
kissed her, as she thought ‘I want to swim in your arteries and veins’.
Brooke brought her hand up to the back of Sam’s head pressing their lips
more closely together, ‘I want to inhabit your heart’ her lips seemed to
say.  She wanted to be a part of Sam’s corporal history.</p>

<p>Sam’s hand trailed up Brooke’s side, “I want to know all of you,” she
breathed out softly, her hands no longer tracing but caressing the skin
underneath them.</p>

<p>Brooke gasped, and smiled into Sam’s mouth.  “Harlot!  You want to go again,
don’t you?” she asked smirking.  In response, Sam merely yanked the rumbled
bed sheet over their heads and allowed the two most dexterous parts of her
body to do her talking for her.</p>
