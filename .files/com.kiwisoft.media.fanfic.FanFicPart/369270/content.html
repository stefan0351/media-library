<p><b>Chapter 15</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The car ride had been oppressively silent, though Lilly preferred that to Michael telling her what a horrible thing she had done. He'd tried, at first, spouting his hateful words at her, but she'd silenced him with a look that was not to be argued with. Now they were sitting in a waiting room in the hospital, both lost in their thoughts and worry. Lilly was warring with herself, going back and forth between the obvious reality of things and the crazy superstitions that suddenly seemed to carry so much more weight. But an image of Miley's face kept appearing in her head, sometimes grinning, sometimes in the throes of making love to her, and others with blood dripping down her forehead. She didn't know what to feel or think and she was hardly keeping herself together. Michael was no help.</p>
<p>A doctor finally came their way and both practically shot to their feet, before he motioned for them to sit back down. The man's face was grim and Lilly's stomach knotted even more tightly in anxiety. The doctor pulled up a chair and sat, looking at them intently.</p>
<p>"I want you to know, both your parents are fine," said the doctor, like a warning to forestall their rising panic.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what to think. What did 'fine' actually mean? Alive? Conscious? The same kind of 'fine' Miley was every time she fell out of a tree? Just that brief thought of her girlfriend twisted Lilly's gut even further. She pushed it aside. Before she could ask the doctor about his definition of 'fine', he continued.</p>
<p>"Your father has a bad break in his leg and he's in surgery right now to fix it, but otherwise he is fine. We'll keep him here for a day or two, but other than having some mobility issues for the next few weeks, he will recover."</p>
<p>Michael remained stoic beside her, though she could tell he had relaxed somewhat, as well. "What about mom?" he asked and Lilly gripped her hands together tightly.</p>
<p>"A dislocated shoulder and a few stitches. She can go home as soon as we finish up the paperwork. If you'd like, I will take you to go see her. Your parents were very lucky," said the doctor seriously and Lilly felt like laughing. He was talking as if it hadn't been bad luck to get them into the accident in the first place.</p>
<p>Michael thanked the doctor and moved to follow him, almost leaving Lilly behind who was so lost in her muddled thoughts. She rushed after them, along the hospital corridors and through the ER towards a curtained off bed. When she finally stepped up to the bed and saw her mom, all the anxiety and fears she'd been walling off came crashing over her and she broke down. She was in her mother's arms immediately, crying, completely overwhelmed by the myriad of emotions she had been feeling.</p>
<p>Heather, too, was surprised to see her normally strong daughter in such a state and hugged her with one arm, laughing lightly. "Lilly, honey, it's okay. I'm alright and so is your father."</p>
<p>Lilly hung on for several more moments, before pulling away. She wiped her eyes almost embarrassed, looking at her mother more closely. Her right arm was in a sling and though there were some tiny cuts on her face and arms, she didn't really look too bad. Lilly sighed. "Mom, I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>Heather looked at her weirdly, cupping Lilly's cheek. "Honey, why are you sorry? You didn't do anything…"</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know why she had said it, really, but an overwhelming panic still hugged her tightly. She glanced back at her brother, whose face remained stoic. Lilly knew, deep down inside, what she was afraid of, but she did not want to admit it to herself. She shook her head, taking her mother's hand in hers and squeezing it. Heather wondered about the look in Lilly's eyes, about what her words had meant, but a nurse came in before she could ask. Lilly tried not to let her relief show, but she was extremely grateful to evade her mom's questioning for now. Because if asked, Lilly would have to admit that suddenly she was afraid Michael had been right all along. That Miley was evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>Lilly glanced at her vibrating phone briefly, before hitting 'Ignore' and stowing the phone back in her pocket. At least she'd had the presence of mind to silence it before entering the library; judging by the looks the librarian was already throwing her way, the woman was none too pleased with her presence. Deciding she couldn't risk standing by the entranceway any longer, and trying to take her mind off of the phone call, she went between some shelves.</p>
<p>Her mother had vanished somewhere among the books, saying she'd only be a few minutes, but it had been much longer than that. Lilly's father had been discharged from the hospital yesterday and since he was laid up at home, they'd decided to get him some reading material from the county library. With her mother not the safest driver at the moment, Lilly had gladly volunteered to get out of the house.</p>
<p>She'd spent the past two days at war with herself and had yet to come to a proper conclusion. Her parents were fine, but the seed of doubt had been planted. Michael still blamed her for the accident and though her parents had said nothing about it, Lilly wondered if they thought it, too.</p>
<p>Her phone vibrated again and she looked at it. A new voicemail. She sighed and deleted it, cursing the guilt she felt at the action. At least Miley did not have a cell phone and thus could not text her. Lilly knew it would be much harder to ignore the girl if she had to read her messages, but the voicemails she could delete without listening to them. And she had deleted several of them over the past few days. At first, Lilly had tried to be annoyed that Miley wasn't getting the hint and kept trying to contact her, but ultimately she'd had to admit to herself that to Miley, this would just be wholly confusing. If Miley felt something, she said it, and she wouldn't understand why Lilly was just ignoring her. Maybe she even thought something had happened to Lilly, as well.</p>
<p>Renewed guilt washed over her and she exhaled heavily, taking a sharp turn towards some computers. She had nothing specific in mind as she searched the library catalogue, but, as if on their own accord, her fingers began typing. Lilly wrote down her results on a piece of paper and wandered off towards some shelves in the back. She found what she was looking for with minimal searching and took her finds towards some machines off on the side. Lilly found herself sitting in front of a microfiche viewer, not even sure what she was doing. She flipped through the pages and realized she was looking at old newspaper reports. She had no idea why she had looked for these microfiche or what she was hoping to find.</p>
<p>Idly she switched between the pages, eyes barely scanning the headlines. Maybe she was going crazy. Maybe it was her punishment for being so horrible to a girl who had never been anything but sweet and loving towards her. Or maybe it was her bad luck from being with Miley finally catching up with her. Guilt grabbed at her again and she shook her head. Something caught her eye as she flipped past and she stopped, staring at the headline in shock.</p>
<p>"Local girl struck by lightning for 2nd time"</p>
<p>She suddenly realized what she'd been looking for all along. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears as she scanned the article. It described the time Miley had gotten struck in a schoolyard during recess. There wasn't much information, but something in particular stood out to her. A teacher had been interviewed for the article, who had told the journalist that Miley had been playing with some kids by the swings and quite suddenly ran off, away from everyone, right before she got struck. The article made no assumptions, but there was a line about what a stroke of luck it had been not more children were hurt.</p>
<p>Lilly pulled the microfiche out with shaking hands and put in another. It seemed like forever, headlines continuously flashing before her eyes, until she found the next article. She repeated this two more times, head spinning as her eyes scanned across the screen, hands sweating. Eventually she stopped, suddenly feeling exhausted, and closed her eyes against the blurriness of her vision.</p>
<p>She got up, almost as if in a haze, though her thoughts were going out of control. Lilly stowed the microfiche back in their shelves and wandered almost aimlessly to the front of the library. She had no idea how long she'd been sitting back there, but her mother was waiting as she returned to the front. They returned to their car, with Lilly stoically silent and her mother respecting her need for quiet.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what it all meant or whether it even meant anything, but one factor seemed to be present in all four articles – how lucky those near Miley had been to not be struck, as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>Voices filtered through her ears, practically unheard, while she sat and stared bleary eyed at the TV. It was beautiful weather outside, sunny and warm, but she could not get herself to leave the house. Part of her feared the possibility she could run into Miley and the other part wished it, making her unsure of herself. She'd even turned down a request from Oliver to come to the creek, citing a fake illness. She just could not deal with anyone and figured it was better to sit here and try to arrange her thoughts. Of course, she hadn't been doing that, either.</p>
<p>With a sigh, she shifted on the sofa, glancing at her phone sitting on the coffee table. Miley had not called her again since the library and Lilly didn't know how she felt about that. Had she finally figured out Lilly didn't want to talk or was something else going on? Had Miley lost interest in her? Or had she finished what she'd planned to do to Lilly and given up? Lilly scoffed at herself, at her horrible thoughts. And she knew they were horrible, judging by the awful guilt that had wrapped itself around her and wouldn't let go. Lilly no longer knew anything and she didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>A weight dropped into the cushions next to her and Lilly looked up. Her mom was giving her a concerned, yet reproachful look and Lilly suppressed a groan.</p>
<p>"What's going on, Lilly?"</p>
<p>Lilly decided playing dumb was her best bet and returned her focus to the TV in front of her. "What do you mean, mom?"</p>
<p>Realizing the girl was trying to avoid talking, Heather leaned forward and turned off the TV. Lilly turned to her, annoyed. "Hey, I was watching that!"</p>
<p>Heather raised an eyebrow. "You were watching The View? Really?"</p>
<p>Lilly scoffed and turned her head again, realizing she had been found out. She knew why her mother was giving her that look and she did not feel like talking. If her mother wanted to talk, she could very well be the one to start it, the girl figured. She remained silent.</p>
<p>Heather sighed, realizing this was going to be difficult. "Lilly, you know you can talk to me. I know something is wrong. You have been inside this house for five days now. You haven't gone to Miley's, you haven't talked to Miley, hell, you haven't even mentioned Miley's name. Did something happen between you two?"</p>
<p>"Why does something have to happen just because I'm not constantly talking about her? And anyway, you and dad need my help. I'm just trying to be here for you," said Lilly gruffly, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>"Well, when you spend weeks having every third word out of your mouth be 'Miley', it's a little odd when it stops completely, hun. And don't use your father or me as an excuse; he's either trying to work from home or watching movies and I'm hardly handicapped enough to need constant supervision."</p>
<p>"Are you saying you want me out of the house?" Lilly decided being difficult was the only way to deflect her real problem.</p>
<p>Heather sighed and turned to put her good hand on her daughter's arm. Lilly finally met her eyes. "You know that's not what I'm saying, Lilly. But I can tell something is wrong. I just don't like seeing you like this…all dark and brooding."</p>
<p>"I'm not brooding," said Lilly, realizing too late her eyebrows were drawn together, giving her that perfect brooding look. She groaned and leaned her head back, frustration shining through. "It's just complicated, mom."</p>
<p>"It didn't seem complicated when Miley was over for dinner. You were positively glowing. And every time you talked about her, you seemed pretty excited," said Heather, knowing she'd have to tread softly now that Lilly seemed to be on the verge of opening up.</p>
<p>Lilly scoffed. "Well, that was before…"</p>
<p>"Before what?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked away, realizing she'd lost. Her voice was hardly audible, as if she herself couldn't believe what she was saying. "Before the accident."</p>
<p>Heather looked confused. "What accident?" Seeing Lilly's face, realization sank in. "<b>Our</b> accident?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded morosely. Heather took a moment to collect her thoughts, trying to think back to her conversations with her daughter. "You think our accident was Miley's fault?"</p>
<p>Hearing her own recent fears put so bluntly made Lilly feel even worse. Yes, it <b>sounded</b> ridiculous, but that didn't change how she suddenly felt. "I don't know what I think, mom. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I can't help worrying that everyone was right all of a sudden."</p>
<p>"I thought you said all those superstitions were crazy talk?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. "I did. I just…isn't it kind of a big coincidence that you and dad get in an accident a day after she comes over for dinner?"</p>
<p>"Do you think if you'd never heard anyone else's accusations about Miley, that you would still think those two were connected?" Heather asked, glad that she had started this conversation. These thoughts seemed to really have been bothering her daughter.</p>
<p>"But I did hear them. And I can't just ignore them."</p>
<p>"You did before."</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed hard. "That was before you and dad nearly died!"</p>
<p>Heather grasped her hand, squeezing until Lilly met her eyes. "Honey, are you blaming yourself for what happened?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, tears filling her eyes as her brother's words rung in her head. Her mother pulled her closer, wrapping her good arm around her shoulders. Lilly snuggled closer, realizing for the first time how upset she'd really been.</p>
<p>"Lilly, neither your father nor I blame you. And we don't think it had anything to do with Miley," said, Heather almost forcefully, to bring the point home.</p>
<p>"But mom…" Lilly tried again, though in reality, a huge weight had already lifted off her chest. She hadn't realized how worried she had been her parents would blame her for bringing Miley into the house.</p>
<p>Heather silenced her. "No, buts, hun. Look, everything that happens is just a result of perspective."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Well, everyone is saying how bad things happen because of Miley, but maybe they're just not seeing the whole picture. Our car rolled three times, and both your dad and I came out relatively unharmed. I call that luck. What if the same is true for everyone else and they just can't see it?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked up at her mother, eyes narrowed. Her mother had worked for lawyers for years and always knew how to twist things around and the girl knew this was no different. "So, you're saying Miley is a good luck charm?"</p>
<p>Heather sighed. "No, I'm saying that people see what they want to and you cannot change that. But what you can change is how miserable you are, and how miserable you are probably making a very sweet girl, by not letting what those people see influence what you do."</p>
<p>Lilly let her mother's words run through her mind, repeating them over and over in her head to fully grasp what they meant. She knew her mother was right; she had known all along, but her own guilt over the accident and Michael's words mixed with those superstitions had clouded her mind. Lilly knew she loved Miley. Lilly knew Miley had never once hurt her. She had accused everyone else for trying to fit random coincidences into patterns and now she was guilty of it herself. How had she fallen prey to such bigoted thinking? How could she have hurt the only girl she had ever really loved?</p>
<p>Lilly sat up abruptly, snatching her phone off the table and stood up. She looked down at her mother, who was trying to hold back a knowing grin. Lilly took a deep breath and exhaled, her face determined. "I gotta go beg a very sweet girl for forgiveness."</p>
<p>She was out the door in the blink of an eye.</p>
