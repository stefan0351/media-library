<p><b>Wow, thank you guys so much for your intrigue in this story! This is my first Glee fic, and I really enjoyed writing these characters. Hope you enjoy!</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>The blonde walked into her empty house and decided to clean up some of the mess in the living room that she neglected to do the night prior, hoping that it would take her mind off of things. Her stomach grumbled halfway through and reminded her of the small fact that because she declined the lunch offer that she'd yet to eat anything. Trudging into her kitchen she opened her refrigerator to see what it had to offer her, immediately seeing the boxes of pizza from the night before. She took out the smallest box and found what was left of the Vegan pizza she'd ordered especially for the brunette singer, the pizza that they'd awkwardly shared. She had to admit that it was a very good pizza, she wouldn't mind ordering it again should she ever want pizza one night. She felt silly for thinking that because she was eating it, it made her feel a little closer to the overachieving Rachel Berry, something she never thought she'd be grateful for.</p>
<p>Her shower was long and cleansing, once she got dressed she sat on her bed, tapping her fingers on her legs, trying to figure out something to do. Her eyes caught the sight of her iPod, it seemed like the best offer she was going to get. She put the earphones in and began thumbing through her music selection, playing her playlist that she made of songs that the club covered throughout the year. She closed her eyes hoping to catch some of the sleep that she'd missed the night before, and before she knew it she was out cold.</p>
<p>Kurt and Mercedes had spent the majority of the afternoon scheming ways that they could help the cheerleader. At one point in her life, Mercedes had hated the queen bee. In fact, the majority of the school hated Quinn Fabray, either for jealousy reasons or because the girl tormented them until they would cry. Glee club brought them all together and Mercedes thought of the girl as a sister, she'd was adamant on helping the girl to get out of her funk. She too noticed that something was particularly off about the girl, Kurt's new found information shed some light on the situation. They did what they knew how to do best.</p>
<p>Quinn awoke from her comatosed stupor several hours later, the sun had just set and luckily when she woke up, she wasn't feeling groggy but refreshed. She went downstairs to sit on one of the couches, placing her cell phone on the coffee table. The staring contest lasted at least several silent minutes; she was willing the phone to ring giving her something to do on this treacherous night. She debated for another several minutes whether or not she should try calling the brunette. What would she say? How would she act? She'd been having visions of what would happen should she call, they either ended in Rachel hanging up on her or Rachel answering but Quinn would only breathe heavily into the phone. She kicked the coffee table.</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous!" she said out loud, mad at herself for taking this so seriously.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang a second later and she perked up, not expecting anyone, she slowly made her way to the front door. She looked through the curtains before she opened it to reveal many of the members of Glee club.</p>
<p>She opened the door with much confusion, "What are you guys doing here?" she asked</p>
<p>Tina wheeled Artie in, "Kurt told us you were having a party tonight" she said excitedly</p>
<p>"He <i>what</i>?"</p>
<p>A few of the members came inside, as she was holding the door she noticed two more cars pulling up, revealing the rest of the group. They all had large bags with them, some pillows and blankets.</p>
<p>Kurt got to the door, "What's going on?" she asked</p>
<p>"You were down and I figured a way to help you get out of your mood" he bumped hips with her, "With your mom gone and all we figured you wouldn't mind, me and Mercedes told everyone you were having a sleepover, and well Puck decided to bring alcohol and presto, instant muscle relaxer" he was quite proud of his concocted plan</p>
<p>Puck came up the steps with a few brown bags, he smirked at the girl and reached into the bag, "Wine coolers for the lady" he bowed, offering it to her</p>
<p>She smacked the side of his head but took the offering regardless, suddenly feeling her throat go dry as she saw that Rachel was right behind him. The girls stared at one another as Rachel went into the home, followed by Finn who was looking exceptionally happy.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go and light the tiki torches" Mercedes yelled walking out of the room</p>
<p>"Tiki Torches?" Quinn asked shutting the door.</p>
<p>Everyone was settling back into the Fabray living room.</p>
<p>"Can I talk to you for a second?" the blonde asked Kurt, pulling him away from the group and bringing him off towards the stair case.</p>
<p>"Seriously, what's going on?"</p>
<p>He sighed, "Sweetie, you are in serious need of a lift me up, and well after our talk today I knew you were too proud to admit your feelings" he told her, rubbing her shoulder</p>
<p>"My feelings?" she asked softer</p>
<p>"For Puck" he told her</p>
<p>"Puck?" she was starting to wonder if she ever woke up from that nap earlier</p>
<p>"Yeah I get it, you like Puck again, you had a bad history but that's in the past, and well we knew you wouldn't just invite him over so I brought everyone, and now you have no choice" he told her, "Right?" he asked, still seeing shock written across the blonde's features</p>
<p>Her eyes trailed across the room to see Rachel and Finn in conversation, laughing about something that probably wasn't that funny. She closed her eyes and swallowed.</p>
<p>"Right" she gave in</p>
<p>"You'll see, it will be fun. I hope you didn't eat dinner already, we took into account the manliness that is Puck and he offered to grill some food for us. Your pool is still opened yes?" he asked</p>
<p>Quinn shook her gaze away from what it was landed on, "Yeah" she told him</p>
<p>"Great, now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do" he told her and glided off</p>
<p>The blonde looked around, seeing everyone happily engaging one another. It took a few more minutes for the shock to wear off but she could at least see the silver lining in all of this. It was better than anything she was going to be doing all night, which included sulking to herself, and it gave her a chance to spend more time with the group, she'd learned she really did miss them over the summer. Most of all, it gave her the chance to be around Rachel and still be covered with the pretense that she actually liked Puck.</p>
<p>She opened the wine cooler and went upstairs to get her bathing suit on, knowing that alcohol plus a pool plus Puck equaled wet clothing, it was better to be safe than sorry when he was around. If only that motto would have resonated with her before she'd allowed them to have sex. She scowled at the wine cooler in her hand, that too, she decided was to blame.</p>
<p>She sat at one of the many metal grated tables that surrounded the pool, most of the members were already in the pool splashing around. Even though it was the beginning of September, it was still summer weather, something they could be thankful for she supposed. She zoned out as she focused on the pool and the people in it, she felt a presence next to her and looked up to find an awkwardly tall Finn with a certain brunette next to him. The patio lights, along with the blue tint from the pool light reflected off of her skin, Quinn scolded herself for thinking such things entirely sober.</p>
<p>They both sat in the chairs at the table, the brunette sat with a little hesitation. Finn jumped right into talking.</p>
<p>"Thanks for having us over Quinn, it's really good for the group. It was really cool of you. " he told her with a nod</p>
<p>She gave him a tight lipped smile and took a sip of the wine cooler that Puck brought for her.</p>
<p>Finn continued to rant, about god knows what. The blonde tuned him out minutes ago, it seemed that the brunette as well learned how to tune the boy out.</p>
<p>"Hudson, I need help" Puck called out to him as he got out of the pool</p>
<p>Finn smiled slightly before getting up to leave to see what his best friend wanted.</p>
<p>Rachel found Quinn's eyes, everything that she was going over in her head for the past 10 minutes or so was completely gone.</p>
<p>"Quinn" the brunette said finally</p>
<p>The blonde had long since looked away from the girl sitting across from her. She needed to keep her emotions in check.</p>
<p>After a few more moments of silence Rachel sighed, knowing she was never going to get the blonde to open up to her, all of her questions would go unanswered as far as she was concerned. The sad part was that she wasn't expecting anything different. The brunette began to rise from her chair without another look towards the blonde, knowing that whatever happened last night was a lost memory.</p>
<p>"You're drinking" the blonde said quietly, nodding to the beverage on the table in front of the girl.</p>
<p>Rachel's confusion was quickly erased when she realized what Quinn was talking about. The brunette didn't answer.</p>
<p>"I didn't think you were the drinking type" the blonde continued, finally lifting her head, eyes penetrating right into the brunettes.</p>
<p>To say the look stole Rachel's words would be an understatement; it stole her breath just as easily. Swallowing her fear and nervousness down, she decided she was ready to answer without sounding like a fool.</p>
<p>"Yeah well, Kurt said he'd cut me so" the brunette was only telling the truth</p>
<p>The blonde laughed slightly, a small smile playing on her lips, causing Rachel to smile as well.</p>
<p>"Sounds about right" she mused</p>
<p>Once again silence took over the two girls.</p>
<p>"Quinn" the brunette tried again</p>
<p>"Don't Rachel"</p>
<p>The brunette was taken aback, a wider smile betrayed her, one that Quinn easily caught.</p>
<p>"You called me Rachel" she told the other girl, pointedly</p>
<p>Quinn closed her eyes, almost in pain that she had let that slip. Things like that meant the world to the petite brunette.</p>
<p>"Why?" the brunette pressed</p>
<p>"Why did I call you Rachel? Because that's your name" the blonde fired back</p>
<p>The brunette frowned slightly, her smile faltered and she knew she was now dealing with the closed off side of Quinn, one that she was very much used to.</p>
<p>"No. <i>Why</i>?" she asked again, hoping to hint at what she was really asking</p>
<p>The blonde sighed, "Don't" she reiterated</p>
<p>"If we talk about this maybe we can figure-"</p>
<p>"I said don't" the blonde snapped</p>
<p>"Okay" the brunette said, "Sorry" she apologized</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too" the blonde replied</p>
<p>Cryptic messages were Quinn's forte, the brunette only wished that she knew what the girl was sorry for. Was it for snapping at the girl, was it for the night before? These questions had been driving Rachel crazy since <i>it</i> happened, her entire night was spent thinking about the blonde. Wondering if she'd ever know the truth, wondering if there was anything that would come of it. The brunette was no fool, she knew how easily it was for her to become attached to someone, she knew that just because someone was nice to her didn't mean that she should become in love with that person. Yet it happened anyway, only this time, she'd believed it was different. Hoping it was different at least.</p>
<p>The blonde picked at the label on the wine cooler, trying to avoid Rachel's gaze. It proved to be tempting but she was using every ounce of willpower that she had to withstand.</p>
<p>"Who wants a burger and who wants a hot dog?" she could hear a certain Mohawk call out to the group</p>
<p>Shouts and hollers were heard from all around the back yard, people calling in their orders. The blonde noticed the brunette looking around uncomfortably, triggering Quinn's realizations to come into focus.</p>
<p>She shot up from her chair and marched the short distance over to where Puck was starting up the grill.</p>
<p>"What did you get Rachel to eat?" she asked</p>
<p>Puck turned around quickly at the voice, "Umm" he answered blankly, his eyes looking towards Rachel.</p>
<p>"Kurt!" Quinn yelled</p>
<p>The boy look towards the grill and came over quickly, seeing an obviously pissed of cheerleader.</p>
<p>"Did you guys consider Rachel's food preferences?" she asked</p>
<p>"Rachel?" he asked, confused by the blonde's use of her first name, "Sorry, I didn't realize" he replied fearfully, not wanting to piss off the blonde any further.</p>
<p>Rachel approached the three, hoping to solve this matter.</p>
<p>"It's quite alright, I'm not that hungry anyway" the brunette said sweetly</p>
<p>Quinn turned towards the girl, "No, it's not okay"</p>
<p>The blonde turned quickly and went into her house, near rampage mode as she went to look in the freezer for something the girl could eat.</p>
<p>A few of them followed after the blonde, to see what she was doing.</p>
<p>"Quinn, what are you doing?" Puck asked</p>
<p>"I think my mom has some kind of veggie burgers in here" she told them sharply, pulling almost the entire contents of the freezer and throwing them on the floor.</p>
<p>Everyone shared nervous glances; they rarely saw her in this type of a mood any more, at least when it wasn't attributed to her pregnancy hormones. No one knew how to broach the situation. Puck took a step forward.</p>
<p>"Babe" he offered</p>
<p>"Do not" she told him, holding her hand up to warn him.</p>
<p>The brunette looked on in horror; the mood swing that Quinn was suffering from was far more severe than she could have ever anticipated. The blonde's eyes were glassy and she was near tears.</p>
<p>The cheerleader opened some cabinets and shuffled things around until she found what she was looking for. Taking the flash light, she walked out of the kitchen and towards a door in the hallway, disappearing a moment later.</p>
<p>Kurt, Puck, Finn and Rachel all stared at each other, unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>"Rachel, go after her" Finn said</p>
<p>"Me? Why me?"</p>
<p>"Because for some reason, she's adamant on finding <i>you</i> something to eat" Kurt told her</p>
<p>Rachel took a deep breath and began to walk towards the door the girl disappeared behind, finding a staircase; it was obvious that the girl had gone into the basement.</p>
<p>"Quinn?" she called out softly</p>
<p>She could hear mumbling and grunting, along with some obscenities off in the corner of the room. She walked up slowly to find Quinn kneeling down in front of another full sized refrigerator unit with a pull out freezer.</p>
<p>The brunette let out a breath and gently placed her hand on the girl's shoulder, kneeling down next to her, hoping to get her to calm down.</p>
<p>"What's going on" the brunette asked, effectively getting the girl to slow her movements.</p>
<p>Quinn huffed, "I know my mom has some kind of Veggie burger somewhere, I'm trying to find them" she says like it's so obvious.</p>
<p>Rachel can clearly see that the girl is virtually amidst an emotional breakdown.</p>
<p>She reached her hand out to cup the girl's face, a gesture one of her dad's would do to get her to calm down, only she never realized how much weight would be brought with that one action. The brunette did in fact find wetness under the girl's eyes and as she studied Quinn carefully, the blonde released a shiver that no doubt was caused by the cold air coming out of the freezer.</p>
<p>"No. What's going on" she asked, hoping once again that the reiteration would get to the core of what she was really asking.</p>
<p>The girl seemed to understand.</p>
<p>"I don't know"</p>
<p>"Why are you going through so much trouble? A month ago, hell even a week ago, you didn't care about me-"</p>
<p>"I do care, okay? So much" she said in a moment of rare honesty</p>
<p>The brunette looked over the girls face, she was quivering, her emotions raking through her, she'd never seen the girl this out of place.</p>
<p>"Why are you crying?" she asked, bringing her voice down even lower.</p>
<p>The blonde let out a shaky breath, "because I care too much" she told the girl, looking into her eyes.</p>
<p>Once again the cheerleader managed to knock the wind out of the brunette without trying hard at all. She was sharing one of the most intense moments she'd ever shared with another human being and it was with the unlikeliest person she could have guessed.</p>
<p>She continued to study her face, "I felt it" the brunette said finally, "I felt the risk, the passion…everything"</p>
<p>The blonde stayed quiet.</p>
<p>"I know you did too" she continued, "I know you're not going to admit it out loud, which is fine, why would you?" the girl asked, the sadness in her voice causing the blonde to surprise her.</p>
<p>"It was the most passionate moment I've ever had with someone" she said slowly, "I felt it Rachel, all of it" she told the girl truthfully, just above a whisper.</p>
<p>"It meant something" the brunette told her reassuringly.</p>
<p>"We can't let it" the blonde retorted almost too quickly.</p>
<p>The brunette didn't let it deter her, "I think we already did" she told her bluntly</p>
<p>The blonde moved forward with the guidance of the brunette's hand that was still close to her face. Because the blonde neglected to turn on the basement lights, the only illumination was coming from the freezer, the icy smoke billowing out of the cold box only created more of a haze for the girls.</p>
<p>"Rach" the blonde whimpered softly, barely touching the girls lips that she's been craving since she last felt them.</p>
<p>"It's okay" Rachel replied softly before touching her lips to the other girls, knowing the blonde was too weak to do it herself.</p>
<p>Once they connected, almost all of their worries vanished. It was just the two of them, the freezer provided coolness for their overheated bodies in the moment. Their eyes were firmly shut, memorizing the feeling of the contact, memorizing what it felt like to have the other one in such a close proximately. Soft moans generated from within them, urging the other on even further. They stayed like that, kissing in the dark and coldness of the basement, barely moving for at least a minute. It still wasn't enough. There was no way to describe the kiss. It was softer than the first one, certainly like nothing they'd ever experienced before, it was gentle, it was what they both needed to reassure them that they weren't hallucinating the night before.</p>
<p>They broke away mutually, breathing hard regardless of the slowness of the kiss, immediately smiling at one another as they rested on each other's forehead. Quinn swallowed and closed her eyes for a brief minute before opening them back up to look into the brunette's eyes.</p>
<p>"I haven't been able to get you out of my head" she told her softly</p>
<p>The brunette bit her lip, afraid to ask the next question, "Do you want to?"</p>
<p>The blonde smiled slightly to herself, looking down while shaking her head, "No"</p>
<p>The brunette waited a beat before lifting the girl's eyes to her, "I'm just as scared as you are"</p>
<p>Quinn swallowed again, still trying to catch her breath so she could get these important words out, "I can't go back to the way we were, I won't be able to now"</p>
<p>Rachel could feel her emotions finally getting the best of her, she didn't want to cry in front of the girl, but it seemed she wouldn't have the choice in the matter, "I don't want that either"</p>
<p>"What are we going to do?"</p>
<p>"Whatever we need to" the brunette told her, she didn't know how she had all the answers but they seemed to satisfy the girl across from her</p>
<p>Quinn nodded.</p>
<p>"Are you guys okay down there?" someone called from the top of the stairs</p>
<p>The blonde wiped her eyes with the back of her hands; "Yeah, we're coming up now" she called out trying her best to sound neutral.</p>
<p>"We should clean this up I guess huh?" Quinn asked</p>
<p>Most of the food was put back within a few seconds, Rachel began to chuckle as she bent down to pick something up.</p>
<p>"What's so funny?"</p>
<p>The brunette stood up with something frozen in her hand, "Veggie Burgers" she laughed</p>
<p>Quinn chuckled as well, taking a step closer to the girl, hearing the sharp intake of breath.</p>
<p>The blonde connected their lips once more, neither knew the next time they would be alone and Quinn wasn't sure she could go that long.</p>
<p>The brunette smiled into the kiss and pulled the blonde closer to her, allowing their bodies to be flush against one another. The kiss dwindled into small pecks on the lips that both girls found themselves giddy over. They finally decided it was time to get back upstairs so that people wouldn't begin to wonder what was going on, the blonde forwardly took the brunette's hand in hers and they walked up the stairs like that. At the top however, Rachel noticed the hesitation that Quinn had in taking the last step. Feeling like she needed some encouragement, the brunette brought the girls hand to her lips, placing a small kiss on her palm. She gave her a smile and passed her on the stairs so she could go first. Quinn smiled to herself, tucking a strand of hair behind her ears and finally taking that last step back into reality.</p>
<p>"What took you guys so long?" Finn asked</p>
<p>"Couldn't find the Veggie burgers" Quinn answered the boy, flashing a sly smile towards the brunette who was already laughing to herself, the brunette returned the smile with a wink before continuing on her path to give Noah the burgers they both worked so hard to find.</p>
<p>The group ate in contentment around 3 of the tables, every once in a while jumping in and out of the pool, playing sharks and minnows, and even had a chicken fight tournament. The blonde watched from the sideline for the majority of the time, comfortable in her wonderment as she watched the small group act as though they've been friends for years. She was right to assume that she would be thrown in the pool against her will, but even that couldn't take her out of her overjoyed mood. Most of the members waited with bated breath as the cheerleader resurfaced above the water, if the lash out over the vegetarian burgers was any indication, they were preparing for serious repercussions. Most of them were shocked to see that she was laughing and only wiping the water out of her eyes. It seemed that the group could breathe again, going right back to the way they were seconds before. The wine coolers weren't necessary for Quinn to feel relaxed, the buzz she was having off of Rachel's presence was enough to do the trick. One by one, they got out of the pool, sitting around the tables, allowing themselves to dry off before they went back inside. It was nearly midnight and no one seemed tired, however the blonde was dying for everyone to go to bed. Kurt found the hidden American Idol game that Quinn purchased upon joining New Directions and recruited people to sing with him. The rest of them sat around watching on in amusement, laughing when someone would miss a note, waiting to see if anyone could top the last person.</p>
<p>Quinn managed to connect eyes with Rachel eventually, nodding her head towards the kitchen, hoping that the brunette would get the hint to meet her in the other room. She got it with ease and rose up from the couch just moments after the blonde left the room. She walked into the kitchen not knowing what she would find.</p>
<p>The blonde was only pouring herself some water to drink when she felt the brunette's presence.</p>
<p>She turned around fully to face the suddenly shy Rachel, leaning her hip against the counter. Bringing the cup up to her lips occasionally, she was amused just by the very sight of the other girl staring at her so intently.</p>
<p>"Hi" the blonde said into her cup</p>
<p>The brunette finally took the necessary steps to allow her to be fully in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Are you having a good time?" the blonde asked</p>
<p>The brunette could only nod, afraid that her voice would betray her if she attempted to speak.</p>
<p>"I was thinking, of maybe asking you" the blonde started, suddenly tongue tied, "if you wanted to sleep in my room, ya know, because the floor is so uncomfortable" her nerves hijacked her mouth and she started to sound like an unsure Rachel Berry because of it, "I'd hate for you to get a stiff back, or something"</p>
<p>The brunette realized how much trouble the cheerleader was having and decided to intervene, she reached out, lightly hooking her fingers around the girl's forearm, letting them slide down until she reached the other girl's hand, "That'd be nice, thank you"</p>
<p>The girls shared a small smile. This feeling was so unfamiliar to Quinn, she'd never had it this bad for someone so suddenly. With Finn, it was just expected, football quarterback and the head cheerleader, it was easy. Puck was a drunken haze, an illusion of what she really wanted. Rachel Berry was nothing like she'd ever experienced before, it was new, it was scary and she'd loved it. She wanted to know all there was to know about the other girl, good and bad. She wanted to know her life story, why she was the way she was, she wanted to get inside her mind and wonder what she was still doing standing in the same room as her. She despised the girl at one point in her life, she told herself it was because Rachel had a blaringly obvious crush on her boyfriend Finn, but in reality she was just jealous of the girl, knowing who she was and what she wanted. She'd always wanted to reach out to the brunette, tell her that she was sorry for all the pain she caused her, but she always found herself closing up at the last second. Her defense mechanism was to just become a bitch so no one would see just how vulnerable she could be. Somewhere along the line she found that she was exhausted of constantly putting up a front towards the other girl and finally just let her guard down, allowing her to care about the trivial things she used to will herself not to think about.</p>
<p>Rachel knew that there was more to Quinn then met the eye; she'd been through a lot after all. There was only so much time you could spend on an emotional roller coaster such as the one the blonde had been on for the past year now. The verbal torment the girl put her through was just a way to take out the anger and hurt she had, while it did upset Rachel, she couldn't hold it against the girl, especially when she was as fragile as she was. There was a certain mystery that surrounded the cheerleader, the brunette was always curious about her but never believed she'd be close enough to ask.</p>
<p>The girls managed to slip away, both feigning exhaustion. Quinn set the members up with places to sleep and it was pretty much every man for themselves. She sighed in relief when the group managed to take up all the spaces in the house, giving the blonde an excuse to have Rachel sleep in the room with her. Though she couldn't imagine herself doing anything with the girl so soon, just having the girl near here seemed to calm her down a significant amount.</p>
<p>The blonde shut the door softly behind them, the brunette allowed her eyes to roam and wander around the walls, taking in the room that she'd always imagined the girl to take refuge in. It just seemed so her. The brunette turned hesitantly towards the other girl when she felt eyes on her intently.</p>
<p>"Why me?" Rachel asked cautiously</p>
<p>"I don't know" Quinn replied painfully honest, "I just know that…this, whatever this is, isn't going to go away" she paused, contemplating her next words, "I don't want it to"</p>
<p>The brunette closed her eyes, knowing that while the answer wasn't exactly something definite, it was just what she wanted to her. They didn't have to have all the answers, in fact it didn't even have to make sense, because they both knew that it didn't, but at least they both felt the same and that was enough for them.</p>
<p>"We should um, get ready for bed" Quinn told her, to which the brunette nodded.</p>
<p>The girls separated for a few moments while they did their nightly rituals, both trying to put off the inevitable, they didn't know what the rest of the night was going to bring.</p>
<p>The blonde walked back into the room slowly, finally done getting ready.</p>
<p>"Now what?" Rachel asked standing in the middle of the room, fiddling with her fingers as she waited nervously</p>
<p>Quinn gave her a smile, letting her know that she shouldn't be scared. She sat on the bed, leaning against the head board.</p>
<p>"Tell me about your life" she said, "Everything"</p>
<p>So the brunette did. She started with the basics, her reason for becoming a Vegan, how she was raised with two fathers, what it was like to meet her birth mother. One topic segued into another, the brunettes initial stiff position at the edge of the bed turned into a lazy lay next to the blonde as Quinn ran her fingers delicately up and down her forearm. They shared laughs, sincere moments, they gushed to each other about things that meant a lot to them, they encouraged the other when things came up that were hard to talk about. Music was their common denominator; it often led back into that topic of conversation, which was fine by the both of them. The brunette was intrigued by Quinn's musical taste, wanting to hear all about why she loved the songs that she did. Eventually the brunette's head rested on the blonde's shoulder, it was something that felt right. Quinn was absentmindedly dragging her nails up and down the girl's skin, leaving goose bumps in their wake.</p>
<p>She couldn't believe how content she was on listening to the other girl speak, an action that used to drive her crazy. She never took the time to actually listen to the subtle cues and hints the brunette would drop about her life when she spoke. However, she found it strange that while Rachel was talking, she'd known almost all of it already.</p>
<p>"I guess we should get to sleep huh?" the brunette asked after a moment of silence</p>
<p>The blonde yawned and looked toward the alarm clock next to her bed. It blared 5:03 in the morning, she couldn't believe how quickly the time had passed.</p>
<p>"Nah" she said through another yawn, "I'm a vampire, I don't sleep" she joked</p>
<p>The brunette giggled against her body, squeezing the side of the blonde's stomach, her left arm was laid across the girl's abdomen for some time now.</p>
<p>"Well that would certainly explain some things" Rachel teased back</p>
<p>The blonde continued to run her fingers through the brunette's hair, she knew that the girl was only kidding but something triggered inside of her. She stopped running her fingers through the girls brown locks.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for the way I've treated you" she said, needing to get the words out, "I didn't know you, I'm so sorry" her voice cracked, she was embarrassed with herself that she could be such a monster to someone so genuine.</p>
<p>"It's okay, I know you didn't mean the things you did" the brunette didn't know that, but she hoped.</p>
<p>The blonde lent down, brushing back hair from the girl's forehead and placing a small kiss on the top of her head before resting her cheek in the same place. After some time, Quinn rearranged herself to be laying flat on her back, instead of resting against the head board. She kept her hold around the girl, she could tell the brunette was beyond exhausted; in fact, she was pretty sure the girl woke up just after the sun rose almost every day. Rachel nudged her nose up, getting the blonde to back up slightly, allowing her to move freely. The brunette closed the distance between them and they shared a sweet goodnight kiss, both girls lingered however, not minding the close proximity of their faces. The last thought Quinn had before sleep took her over was that she hoped the brunette would still be in her arms when she awoke a few hours later. Rachel sighed contently, hoping that the blonde would still be this person when they woke up the next morning.
