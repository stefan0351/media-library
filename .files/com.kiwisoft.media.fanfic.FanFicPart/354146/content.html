<!-- And It All Became So Clear \ Part 4 -->

<p>Secure, warm, and loved. I felt all of those things as I opened my
eyes to greet the morning. A smile spread across her face as I remembered the previous
night. I was happier than I could ever remember being in my entire life and I knew that
without I owed it all to the woman I was snuggled up against. Raising myself onto my
elbows looked up so that I could regard the sleeping face above me.</p>

<p>&quot;It's about time you woke up,&quot; Buffy said with a smile,
her eyes still closed.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you were still asleep,&quot; I said watching her.</p>

<p>&quot;I know what you thought,&quot; she said finally opening her
eyes. She looked down at me and smiled. &quot;Waking up like this makes morning infinitely
more tolerable.&quot; She commented. I smiled back and shifted so that our faces were only
inches apart then moved in and kissed her as my hands started to roam. &quot;I think I've
created a monster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would be counter productive to you job don't you
think?&quot; I asked nipping at her neck.</p>

<p>&quot;What was I thinking? Really Will, I'm a Slayer not a
machine,&quot; she said laughing now. The object of stopping at the motel had been to get
rest, however, we didn't much succeed at that. In fact I know for sure that I expended
more energy once we arrived than before.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I tire you out?&quot; I asked with fake concern.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't we find out?&quot; she asked flipping me over.</p>

<p>&quot;I love the way your mind works,&quot; I said giving into the
double assault of Buffy's hands and tongue. She laughed and mumbled something that I
couldn't hear then we settled down for some serious loving.</p>

<p>Buffy and I managed to drag ourselves out of bed around noon when
Giles came knocking at our door. As we exited our room, I accidentally bumped into the guy
who had the room beside us. He looked down at me and kinda smirked, then started trying to
look around me. When Buffy came out of the room, he shifted his gaze between the two of
us, then started laughing saying &quot;No way!!! No wayyyy&quot;, and headed back into his
room yelling &quot;I told you so!&quot;.</p>

<p>Once he was gone Buffy looked at me and said &quot;We're going to
have to work on volume control.&quot;</p>

<p>The ride back to Sunnydale was uneventful and torturous. It was
driving me mad, being shoved up against Buffy for the entire ride and not being able to
touch her. Not to mention the fact the Buffy and Faith kept getting in little fights about
nothing, then tried to hit each other, the main problem with that being that I was in
between them. The only thing that saved me from having to endure this for the entire ride
was that I nearly got clipped in the eye and Buffy put a stop to it. At that point we
still had about three more hours to go though so a game of twenty questions was started
up. I'm not sure which was more painful, being the cream in a Slayer Oreo, or trying to
find out what brand of tea Giles was.</p>

<p>Despite all reason, we went Bronzing later that night. Buffy tried
to get me out there dancing with her and Faith, but I wasn't exactly 'gettin' jiggy wit
it' and decided to just switch between watching them, playing pool with Xander and
avoiding Cordelia. We stayed there for about two hours before Buffy and I decided to book.
We just wanted to spend some time alone, and she still had to make a patrol so I went with
her.</p>

<p>It was wonderful just walking around holding hands talking. Even
though Buffy's attention was split between me and looking for vamps, just being out there
with her felt really special, like we were a real couple. Except for one brief moment
where I was inexplicably mad at society for making us feel like we should have to hide
what we were feeling for each other, the patrol went wonderfully. Afterwards we went for
mocha's then ended up at the park. We sat down on the swings while we finished our drinks,
then Buffy pushed me on them. It was all ridiculously romantic, and I loved every second
of it. After that we moved over to the bench and just sat there for a while, just looking
up at the stars. We got bored of that after a while though, and somehow ended up kissing
on the bench. I don't think that it was one or the other of us who started it, it just
happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Buffy exhaled a moment after we broke apart,
which wasn't exactly the reaction I was expecting. Then I noticed that she was looking
behind me. I figured that there was a vamp or something behind me and turned around so
that I could see. It wasn't a vamp, however, it was Xander and Faith.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; I repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I covered that Will,&quot; Buffy responded, standing
up. I joined her and we walked over to our stunned friends.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know that you were a 'girlfriend' girlfriend.&quot;
Faith said with a smirk winking at Buffy.</p>

<p>&quot;Wil....Bu...ki...tongu...&quot; Xander started then stopped
settling on a stupefied expression. Buffy and I looked at each other, then back to Xander
and Faith and sighed. It was going to be long, long night, but what else was new?</p>
