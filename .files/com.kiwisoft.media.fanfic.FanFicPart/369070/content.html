<p><b><hr size=1 noshade>Chapter IX</b></p>
<p>The ancient radio on the counter was playing an old Dolly Parton song, its old speakers distorting the sound into a horrible, tinny mess. Miley's mother was at the kitchen sink washing dishes, humming along to the song over the horrible noise. On the right of the eat-in kitchen bench sat Grandma Ruby, browsing the obituaries in the local newspapers, her reading glasses perched low on her nose. An old clock above the doorway with pictures of chickens instead of numbers ticked loudly enough to be heard over the din of the radio. Miley looked up at it, watching the second hand moving across the dial in sheer boredom.</p>
<p>Susan moved to put some of the dishes away and noticed Miley's wandering attention. "Miley, eat your breakfast."</p>
<p>Miley's gaze returned to the bowl in front of her. She dipped her spoon half-heartedly into the watery oatmeal, scooped some up and let it drip back into the bowl without much enthusiasm. Glancing up, she noticed her mother's stern gaze directed at her. Miley frowned.</p>
<p>"Momma, you know I don't like oatmeal."</p>
<p>"I know, honey, but we're out of everything else. I'm going to the store later," said Susan, drying her hands on the dishtowel.</p>
<p>Miley perked up at the thought of a store with tons of things to see. "Can I come?"</p>
<p>Susan hesitated, knowing Miley's presence could triple the time spent in the store, but the sound of heavy footsteps out in the living room distracted her. "If you finish your oatmeal."</p>
<p>Miley grimaced at the thought and turned back to her new enemy. When she heard someone enter the kitchen, however, she looked up, just in time to see Richard plant a 'good morning' kiss on her mother's lips. Something cold twisted inside of her and when he turned to wink at her, Miley quickly averted her eyes. Susan, mindful of her daughter's feelings, kept a fair distance from Richard while they talked before he left for work. Nevertheless Miley kept her eyes glued to her bowl while she choked down her breakfast and tried not to gag, whether from the oatmeal or the improper displays of affection she couldn't tell.</p>
<p>Several hours later she sat in the passenger seat of Richard's brand-new Ford F150 truck, a bag of delicious gummy worms in her lap, the incident at breakfast already forgotten. Her mother had needed to make a quick stop at the post office and instructed Miley under threat of loss of her gummy worms to stay where she was. Miley, for once, was content to just sit in the truck, happy she'd gotten to spend alone time with her mother and even managed to talk the woman into buying her candy. Richard's truck was pretty nice, too, as long as he was nowhere in it. He'd gotten a ride to work so Susan could use his truck to run her errands in Murfreesboro; Grandma Ruby's old truck was unlikely to make the journey anymore.</p>
<p>Miley snatched another gummy worm out of her bag and sucked it into her mouth. It was finally Spring and warming up enough that she had her window rolled down, enjoying the warm breeze outside. Miley moved to prop her legs up on the dashboard and accidentally kicked the console with a loud thud. The glove compartment sprung open and several folders spilled onto Miley's feet. She quickly set the gummy worms aside and bent down to pick up the folders â€“ she knew she'd be in trouble if her momma found her like this. Just as she was trying to stuff the folders back into the glove compartment, she saw her name written in bold on the front of one of them.</p>
<p>Miley didn't hesitate to open it, consequences be damned. Inside was a sheet with her biographical data and school information and in the right pocket were several pictures. She pulled them out, heart hammering in her chest. Had she finally found proof Richard was out to get her? The pictures were mostly in black and white, candid shots of her out in what looked to be Murfreesboro. She couldn't be sure exactly when they were taken, but the last showed her sharing milkshakes with her father at Poppy's Burgers. Something pricked at the back of her eyeballs and Miley quickly shoved the pictures back into the folder.</p>
<p>She reached for the others and noticed there were more names written across their fronts. Miley opened the first folder, noticing the same set-up as in her folder but for one difference â€“ a large, red X had been drawn across the biographical page. She quickly went through the other three, finding the exact same thing. Miley flipped through the pictures stashed in each of the folders. They were similar to hers â€“ all of four different teenaged girls out in public places. Miley did not recognize the other girls, but noticed from the background in the pictures some of them were clearly not taken in Middle Tennessee - one girl was fighting through knee-high snow, while another relaxed at the beach.</p>
<p>The driver's side door opened, startling Miley heavily enough she spilled the photos onto the floor. Susan got into the truck and immediately noticed Miley staring at her, pale-faced and silent. She turned to look at her daughter, worried for a brief moment about the girl's health, but then noticed the folders and pictures spilled across Miley's lap. Sudden dread and anger boiled up inside of her â€“ how would she explain to Richard Miley was going through his personal things? How could she get Miley to finally listen to her?</p>
<p>"Miley Ray S-" Susan started, her voice rising by the third syllable, but Miley interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Momma, there are pictures of me."</p>
<p>She sounded not at all insolent like Susan had imagined, but almost scared and it stopped her for just a split-second. Then she thought of Richard lending her his truck and having his things gone through in return. "Why are you going through Richard's things? I've had enough of this Miley, honestly. Put everything back right now."</p>
<p>"It was an accident, momma," said Miley in defense, but knew it didn't matter. What mattered to her were the strange folders and the four girls who had been crossed out like items on a shopping list.</p>
<p>Susan didn't wait for Miley to follow her instructions and grabbed the photos and folders herself to stow back in the glove compartment. "I swear, everything is an accident with you, child. Richard is a good man and I'm sick and tired of you acting like he's the devil. This has got to stop, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley watched, a sinking feeling in her chest, as her mother forcefully took the pictures from her hands to stuff back into the glove compartment. Why wasn't her mother listening? "There are pictures of other girls, too a-and information on them. Why does Richard have all these folders, momma?"</p>
<p>Susan slammed the glove compartment shut, making Miley jump just a little. She sat in the driver's seat, despair over the unsolvable situation weighing heavily on her. She didn't turn to look at her daughter when she finally spoke, pulling on her seatbelt instead. "Richard is a physical therapist; he has a lot of patients and he has files for each patient. You, too, were his patient, Miley."</p>
<p>"But the other girls are all crossed out," countered Miley, unsure whether the folders she had found could merely be patient files from Richard's job.</p>
<p>"I don't know, Miley. Maybe they're no longer his patients," said Susan impatiently, already pulling out of the parking spot.</p>
<p>Miley frowned, considering the possibility. It still did not sit right with her. "There was a picture of me and Dad."</p>
<p>Susan shot Miley a quick, stern look. "I'm done talking about this, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley knew from the tone in her mother's voice and the look in her eyes she was telling the truth. Her mother refused to believe her, too caught up in Richard's web of lies and deceit. All she could hope for was to call the only person in the world who would trust her no matter what. She risked a side-ways glance at her mother.</p>
<p>"Are you gonna ground me?"</p>
<p>Susan sighed heavily and her whole body seemed to sag as if the fight had been drained out of her. "There's really no point, is there? You're just gonna do whatever you want anyway, with no regard to anyone else."</p>
<p>Miley wanted to protest, but decided to remain silent. Something pricked at the back of her eyeballs again and she whipped her head around to stare out the window, forcing the tears back. Richard was taking the only family she had left, but Miley couldn't just sit there and let it happen.</p>
<p>Several hours later she was lying on her bed, her cellphone on her chest as she stared up at the ceiling, Lilly's voice over the speaker calming her. At least her mother's uncaring attitude about grounding Miley was allowing her to speak with Lilly after her discovery earlier. Lilly, who'd liked Richard well enough the few months she had known him, sounded a lot more skeptical than Susan had.</p>
<p>"I don't know, Miles, it does sound kind of shady, I admit. He hasn't been your therapist in months, so why would he have your file?" Lilly wasn't expecting an answer and did not receive one. She knew Miley was upset, more over her mother's attitude regarding this mystery than over any potential danger Richard posed. Lilly, on the other hand, was worried.</p>
<p>"You said there was a picture of you and your Dad?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded absentmindedly, then remembered she was on the phone. "Yeah."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't think there was any way Richard could explain that away â€“ he'd been Miley's therapist long after Mr. Stewart had passed away. She wished for the umpteenth time she could be with her girlfriend instead of on a road trip with her parents. But they were already halfway to Florida and Lilly would not be able to see Miley for another week. Lilly heaved a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>"Justâ€¦try to stay away from him for now, okay? We'll try to figure something out when I get back. And Miley," Lilly added, though she knew any warning would likely fall on deaf ears, "be careful."</p>
<p>"I always am," said Miley and though it was her trademark answer, for once she sounded almost serious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>It was the first truly nice day of the year â€“ sunshine, few clouds and the smell of spring in the air. There were even a few birds, their songs interrupting the otherwise calm air. The trees ahead were sporting fat buds already that would unfurl into leaves over the next month. Miley normally would have considered this the perfect day for being outside and climbing a few trees, but today she merely walked along dutifully, not even straying from the path. She was glad to get out of the house where she'd practically been confined for days without reprieve, but would rather have done so without half of her current company.</p>
<p>Several days of rainstorms had forced Miley to remain indoors under the watchful eyes of her mother and grandmother and the girl hadn't dared, for once, to get into even more trouble by escaping. Now that the sun had finally come out, Susan had suggested they go for a walk on the nearby hiking trails, though since she had invited Richard along, Miley would almost have preferred to stay at home. Almost, because there was only so much sitting inside she could take.</p>
<p>She was walking several feet ahead and turned around every few minutes to ensure they were still behind her. She'd been instructed not to wander off, but every time she turned her head Miley had to look at her mother and Richard ambling along while holding hands and she considered bolting for the tree line every time. Facing the front, she quickly extended the distance once again, not liking having to be here with Richard one bit.</p>
<p>Up ahead she came across a branching path, a small sign detailing its level and distance. Miley stopped to look down the new path, momentarily forgetting about her mother and Richard behind her. Thick, tall trees lined the path and though they had no leaves, little light seemed to reach the ground. The smaller path ran straight for a good fifty yards, before making a sharp turn hidden from view by the thick tree trunks. Miley frowned as she looked along the part she could see, the hairs on her arms rising as an odd feeling settled inside of her. Something was telling her to take this path, to follow it to its conclusion, though she could not say what it was drawing her in. The path seemed ominous at best. She took a step towards it, but a sudden voice behind her reminded Miley she was not alone.</p>
<p>"You don't wanna take this path, do you?"</p>
<p>Miley turned and looked directly at Richard. She'd followed Lilly's advice and managed to stay away from him as best as she could and this was the first time she'd met his eyes in days. His voice had been even and calm, as always, but something akin to curiosity in his eyes gave away his nonchalance. Miley cocked her head slightly, now curious herself.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>Richard finally let go of her mother's hand and stepped closer, eyeing the path before them with an unperturbed gaze. "I just don't think you want to take this path, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley narrowed her eyes. Could Richard, too, feel the eerie vibe washing over her in waves as she stood in close proximity to the path? Was whatever he didn't want her to know hidden at the end of the path and he was trying to keep her from finding out?</p>
<p>"It just looks so dark and closed in. I think we'd all rather enjoy the sunshine, don't you?" Richard was talking to her, but Miley knew he'd added this reason for her mother's sake. She somehow knew he did not care about the creepiness. Susan, however, nodded in agreement, already moving along the main path as if dismissing Miley's idle idea.</p>
<p>Knowing Richard did not want her to go, however, kept Miley from being deterred. She set out onto the dark path, not looking back. "I wanna see what's at the end; it looks mysterious."</p>
<p>Susan complained and tried to talk Miley out of it, but Richard did not utter a word as the two adults followed her along the path. Miley ignored her mother, unconcerned by the thought of possible punishment, and pushed on, deeper into the woods, past trunks twice the girth of her body, bare branches occasionally brushing her arms and face. Without the sun to warm them it was considerably cooler in this section of the woods and Miley rubbed her arms for warmth. She considered turning to check the others were still following, but did not want to be greeted by a display of Richard warming up her mother.</p>
<p>Miley continued, silent as she walked along the path. She knew her mother was still following, the woman's pleas to just turn around letting Miley know she was there. Richard said nothing, but Miley knew he was still following. It took another few minutes before a clearing opened up ahead, warm sunshine painting a circle onto the cold, moist earth. Large, heavy stones outlined the sun circle, as if someone had anticipated its presence. Inside the stone circle were the remains of charred branches, ashes dusted across the stones. Miley stepped into the clearing without hesitation. She walked up to the stone circle, her curiosity winning out as always. It still smelled faintly of burnt wood along with some other curious scents she could not discern. Odd symbols had been drawn onto the surfaces of the stones with ash and though they were partially smeared and foreign, somehow Miley felt she had seen them before. She reached for one of the stones, a strange tingling in her fingertips as they brushed across the ash symbol.</p>
<p>"Miley!"</p>
<p>She glanced over her shoulder at Richard. She hadn't realized the two adults had fallen so far behind and watched as they reached the edge of the clearing. Miley stood and wiped her hand on her pants, before stepping into the stone circle. The ash was soft under her sneakers and she turned her face upward, letting the warmth seep back into her bones as the sunlight fell on her.</p>
<p>Then suddenly everything happened in quick succession. The sunlight faded and with it its comforting warmth. Goosebumps erupted across Miley's skin, the small hairs on the back of her neck standing on end. She sucked in a quick breath at the familiar heaviness in her stomach and looked back to where her mother stood. Richard, his hand now on Susan's elbow, was pulling her backward into the path they'd just left. His eyes met Miley's, the first time since she'd met him they were anything but calm and in that split-second she realized Richard, too, knew what was about to happen. The bolt of light reached down from heaven and pierced her chest and then there was nothing.</p>
