<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Stirring the Pot -->

<p>It stands to reason that if you wait for a problem to sort itself out, one of two things can happen: 1) the problem will eventually sort itself out or; 2) the problem will grow 1000x times worse. Also, according to some wise ass named Murphy, 'whatever can go wrong will go wrong'. Nicole realized all of these facts as she watched events unfold with a feeling of complete and utter horror. </p>
<p>The morning had started innocently enough. She and Lily had gone for a walk at a nearby park not far from Terri's house. Despite her 'bitch' image, Nic really was a quiet and romantic person. She loved to take quiet walks with Lily and just hold her hand, talking about nothing and everything and passing the time feeling loved and accepted. It was something she never got at home, unconditional love, but it was something Lily gave her without reservation. Nicole still wondered what she did to deserve someone as special and wonderful as Lily. </p>
<p>They walked all that morning talking about what they wanted to do after high school. Nicole was relieved to hear that all of Lily's plans included her in some way. Lily wanted Nic in her life for the foreseeable future and for the first time in her life Nicole felt like she really belonged with and to someone. She never wanted that whole and complete feeling to end. And Nicole had shared Lily's sentiment about sharing a life together. Over all, they were both very happy when they'd arrived back at Terri's. </p>
<p>That was until they saw the strange car in the driveway. The black sedan sent chills down Nicole's spine and made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. She didn't know how she knew but she just knew that that car meant trouble. Her suspicions were confirmed a few minutes later by loud angry shouts coming from the house. </p>
<p>"Stop it! You can't do this, Dad! I won't let you!" It was clearly Brooke in near hysterics. The mention of the word 'Dad' brought Lily and Nicole running to the door. </p>
<p>"Shit, Mike," Nicole swore. They opened the door to a scene that would haunt them both. Mike stood in the middle of the room with an almost wild look in his eyes. Brooke was standing in front of Sam who was sprawled on the floor at her mother's feet with Terri and Jane checking on her. It was obvious that Mike's anger had gotten the better of him and he'd taken it out on Sam. She was staring back up at him with a look of complete terror on her face that neither Lily or Nicole could remember seeing before. It was shocking to see the normally calm Sam looking so scared. </p>
<p>"What the Hell is going on here?" Nicole yelled, drawing Mike's attention from Sam to her. He glared at her. </p>
<p>"Family business, go away. Your parents will be here shortly," he snarled. Lily crossed the room to help Sam and Brooke, heedless of Mike while Nic crossed her arms and arched an eyebrow at the maniac male. </p>
<p>"Family business, huh? I know all about family business that involves hitting. Lay a hand on Sam OR Brooke again and I'll break every bone in your body, understand?" she growled refusing to back down. If there was one thing Nicole was familiar with handling, it was a bullying parent. Mike advanced slowly on her. </p>
<p>"Who are you to tell me what I can or can't do? Brooke is MY daughter, and I'll do as I see fit!" he bellowed. </p>
<p>"Leave her alone and get out of my house, Mike!" Terri yelled from where Lily and Brooke held Sam up by her arms. Jane was crying and examining Sam carefully. </p>
<p>"Not without my daughter," he spat turning his attention to Terri and Jane. "And you," he hissed at Jane. "Knew all this time where they were. If I hadn't flown out here to surprise you I never would have known you'd been lying to me. How could you?" </p>
<p>"How could YOU?" Jane shot back beyond angry. "You just beat the crap out of Sam because she tried to protect me and Brooke from you. What does that say about you? You beat a 17 year old girl who was trying to protect her mother and the girl she loves from an insanely angry man!" </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam whispered quietly. "You OK?" Brooke wiped at Sam's face and managed to spare the girl a smile. </p>
<p>"Yes, Sammy, I'm fine," she said placing a gentle kiss to Sam's forehead. </p>
<p>"Get out of my house before I call the cops, Mike. Or take care of you myself. I have a gun permit, you know," Terri threatened lowly. Mike huffed and glared. </p>
<p>"Fine, but I'll be back for my daughter. You have no legal right to her, she's mine," he declared. </p>
<p>"I belong to NO ONE," Brooke ground out as she held onto Sam. "Least of all an abusive, homophobic asshole. You told me that if I didn't end things with Sam that I had to leave. Well, I left. Deal with it." </p>
<p>"You're too young to make such decisions, that's what you need me for," Mike told her condecendingly as he headed for the door. "I WILL be back. Be packed and ready to go, Brooke. I mean it." </p>
<p>"Get lost, Mike," Brooke spat, her voice dripping with venom. Mike slammed the door behind him leaving the six women in silence. </p>
<p>"Here, Sammy, sit on the couch," Jane said leading Lily and Brooke to set their precious cargo down on the sofa. Sam sat with a groan and closed her eyes. </p>
<p>"What the hell happened here?" Lily asked finally. </p>
<p>"I'll get the first aid kit and some ice, be right back," Terri said leaving the room. Brooke sat down next to Sam as the brunette leaned into her. Jane shook her head. </p>
<p>"I'm not exactly sure but that was NOT the man I was going to marry," she muttered as she went back to looking over Sam's injuries.</p>
<p>"Can someone please tell us what the hell is going on?" Nicole asked walking up behind Lily to wrap her arms around her for comfort. Brooke continued to hold Sam silently so Jane took it upon herself to explain.</p>
<p>"Mike came to surprise me and when I wasn't at the hotel, he found out where the taxi's had been taking me, I guess. He pulled up and caught Sam and Brooke out front. They tried to talk to him and brought him inside but he just went ballistic." </p>
<p>"After we argued for a few minutes, he went to slap me and Sam stopped him. The next thing either Brooke or I knew, he was just beating her and ranting that it was all her fault. When Brooke went to stop him, he shoved her and Sam got in his way again. She let him know that he was never laying a hand on Brooke, ever," despite the dire situation, a hint of pride creeped into Jane's voice as she spoke about Sam's actions. </p>
<p>"He started to hit her again until Terri dragged him off of her. He then demanded that Brooke go home with him and he was taking her whether she liked it or not. That's about when you two arrived." </p>
<p>"Jesus," Nicole swore as she looked at the damage done to Sam. She had some cuts and bruises on her face and a dazed expression on her face. Her eyes were glassy and she didn't seem to be looking at anything in particular. </p>
<p>"You OK there, Spam?" Nic asked softly. Sam blinked a few times and tried to focus on Nicole. She frowned. </p>
<p>"Yeah," she sighed but said nothing else. Nicole looked at Brooke in worry. It was unlike Sam to be so quiet. Brooke looked close to tears and bit her lip. </p>
<p>"Here's the first aid kit," Terri announced walking back into the room. "Let's take a look at you, kiddo." She gently wiped some blood away from Sam's face with a gauze pad as Sam stared blankly at her. </p>
<p>"You OK, Sam?" Terri asked concerned. Sam closed her eyes and leaned further into Brooke's arms. </p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam repeated. </p>
<p>"Maybe we should take her to the hospital," Lily suggested. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"'M OK," she said. "I just hurt," she explained. </p>
<p>"Where Sammy?" Jane asked. Sam opened her eyes for a second and looked at her mother. </p>
<p>"Everywhere," she admitted. "Is everyone OK?" </p>
<p>"Sam, worry about yourself," Brooke told her. "We're fine." </p>
<p>"Sam, where are you hurt?" Jane asked again, growing aggitated. Sam sighed. She hated it when her mother was in overprotective mode. </p>
<p>"My head and ribs mostly," she replied. "I'm fine, really." </p>
<p>"Liar," Brooke accused playfully. She could feel Sam shaking from pain and fear in her arms. She knew she was going to have nightmares about her father beating Sam for a long time to come. And she was never going to forgive him for it either. </p>
<p>Jane and Terri examined Sam's face as she squirmed slightly and Jane checked her ribs. Satisfied that she was badly bruised but not broken, they left her alone a few minutes later. She snuggled back into Brooke's warm embrace and sighed. </p>
<p>"Can we not ever do that again?" she asked pitifully. Brooke hugged her gently. </p>
<p>"I'm so very very sorry, Sammy," Brooke apologized, her voice thick with unshead tears. </p>
<p>"Not your fault, Brooke," she reassured the blonde. "But what are we going to do when he comes back?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno, Sammy. We'll deal when it happens. Let's take care of you for now and put you to bed." </p>
<p>"'Kay," Sam agreed. A nap sounded really good to her right now. She kind of hoped that when she woke up this entire day would turn out to be nothing more than a horrible nightmare. But somehow, she knew that wasn't going to be the case. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam was asleep in the bed she shared with Brooke, finally having settled down after a doctor friend of Terri's came by and looked her over. He would have rathered that Sam went to the hospital but she refused so he was forced to evaluate her there. Mike had banged her up pretty bad but she'd be all right with a few days rest. The doctor wrote a prescription for some pain medication and antibiotics and left her to rest. Brooke was laying in the bed beside her when Jane looked in to check on her. </p>
<p>"How she doing?" Jane asked. Brooke lovingly brushed some hair out of Sam's bruised face and sighed. </p>
<p>"She's asleep but she had trouble getting comfortable. God, Mom, I can't believe that that man was my father," she said in shock. Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I know, I can't believe it was him either. Brooke, I'm sorry but I don't think I can marry your father after what he's done," Jane said sadly. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"I don't want you to," Brooke admitted. Jane looked at her in surprise. "Mom, and you'll always be my mom," she smiled at Jane, "you deserve better than him. I know he's my Dad but I don't know who he is anymore. I want to see you happy and he won't make you happy in the long run. Plus, if he'll hit Sam like this, what will he eventually do to you or me or Mac?" Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"Good points all," she agreed. "I'm glad you understand." </p>
<p>"I wouldn't have let you marry him after this," Brooke said firmly. She looked back at Sam's sleeping face and sighed. </p>
<p>"I love her so much, Mom," she said as she started to cry, the days events catching up with her. Jane moved closer to hug the crying blonde. </p>
<p>"I know you do, honey," Jane soothed. </p>
<p>"I just don't understand why I should be forced to choose between my father and my very heart and soul. It's not fair," Brooke wept. </p>
<p>"No, it's not. I am so sorry," Jane whispered. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam's sleepy voice carried over to them both. She frowned when she saw Brooke's tears. "Aw, baby don't cry," she implored. Brooke buried her face in Sam shoulder as sobs shook her frame. Seeing that the girls needed each other more than her right now, Jane stood up and quietly left the room. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"This is just freaking great. For all we know, Mike and our mothers are going to appear on the front doorstep with the Army in tow at any second," Nicole ranted. Lily gently rubbed Nicole's shoulders. </p>
<p>"Relax, Niki, it can't be that bad," she looked up at Terri. "Can it?" </p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's probably going to get pretty bad," Terri conceeded. "And unfortunately there's nothing I can really do to help."</p>
<p>"You've already done so much by letting us stay here in the first place, Terri. I don't know if we've thanked you enough," Lily said. Terri shrugged her off. </p>
<p>"No thanks is necessary. I was happy to help," she told them. "I really wish there was more I could do." </p>
<p>"It's better you not get any further dragged in," Nicole broke in. "No one should have to deal with my mother if they can avoid it."</p>
<p>"That bad, huh?" Terri asked. </p>
<p>"You know Joan Crawford?" Nic asked. Terri nodded. "Donna Reed compared to my mom." </p>
<p>"Yeesh," Terri groaned. "My condolences." </p>
<p>"Thanks," Nicole snickered. She hugged Lily tightly. "So, what do we do now?" </p>
<p>"We could leave again," Lily suggested. Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"We can't spend our lives running, Lil. That's not the life I want for you." </p>
<p>"But I don't want to be seperated from you," Lily complained sadly. </p>
<p>"You won't be, ever, Lil. Even if they send me away, I'll come back. I promise," Nicole vowed. Lily smiled at her. </p>
<p>"I know you will," she said. "I just wish it didn't have to be this way." </p>
<p>"Unfortunately, this is the way it is right now. Lily, we WILL find a way through this," Nicole told her worried lover confidently. "I don't know how but someday this will all just be a bad memory that we can overlook together." </p>
<p>"I hope so, Niki," Lily sighed. Unseen by Lily, Nicole bit her lip and sent up a silent prayer to whoever was listening that one day she would be right. She wasn't so sure and being optomistic was a new role for her. But for Lily, she would try. </p>
<p>They were still standing in the kitchen with Terri when Jane walked in and joined them. </p>
<p>"How's Sam?" Lily asked. Jane shook her head. </p>
<p>"Hurt and tired," she lamented. "I swear I should call the cops on Mike for what he did to her," she said angrily. She was so mad at Mike that she wanted to wrap her hands around his throat and squeeze. But for Brooke's sake, and Mac's, she swallowed her urge for revenge. </p>
<p>"You should," Nicole spat harshly. "Asshole deserves to be arrested for hurting her like that. And if he does it once, Jane, he'll do it again. Next time it could be you, or Brooke, or God forbid, little Mac."</p>
<p>"I know," Jane admitted sadly. "That's why I just told Brooke I can't marry him now. Not after this. Our relationship is over." </p>
<p>"In a way I'm sorry," Lily said quietly. "You two were happy for awhile. And this is such a stupid thing to lose your engagement over but in a way it's good that you got to see what he was really like BEFORE you married him." </p>
<p>"I guess," Jane shrugged. She looked up at Terri. "Was he ever like this with Kelly?" Terri frowned. </p>
<p>"Not that I really know of, at least not physically. Kelly did complain from time to time that his mood swings were extreme. One second he was fine and then enraged the next. It was one of the contributing factors to her leaving him. Among her 'other' problems. She never would have left Brooke with him if she thought he'd ever hit her though." </p>
<p>"He always struck me as so calm and quiet," Lily spoke up. Nicole snorted. </p>
<p>"Yeah, and it's always the quiet ones you have to watch out for," she remarked. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>They were quietly eating dinner, except for Brooke and Sam who were still sleeping in their room when the doorbell rang. With a look of dread and resignation, Terri rose to answer the door. Upon opening it, she was immediately faced with several police officers as well as Mike, Gayle Julian and Maria Esposito. </p>
<p>"We're here for our daughters," Gayle announced snottily. "Unless you want to spend time in jail, I suggest you hand them over." Knowing that she had no choice but hating it, Terri opened the door all the way and let the stampede into her house. </p>
