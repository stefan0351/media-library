<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER EIGHT</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL</p>
<p>'Mamaw' Ruthie Stewart, Robbie Ray's mother and Miley and Jackson's grandmother, lived on a small farm of her own just outside of Pine Ridge. A friendly but outspoken woman, she was also known to be very protective of her family… and she knew her family needed her now.</p>
<p>Standing on the front porch of her small home, she watched as Robbie Ray's pickup truck made its way up the dusty driveway towards her. It pulled up beside her a few moments later, and the driver's side door swing open. Ruthie smiled as her son climbed slowly out of the pickup and walked over to her.</p>
<p>"Hey, mom," Robbie Ray greeted his mother.</p>
<p>"Good to see you, son," Ruthie replied, hugging him gently. She paused. "I want you to know, I'll always love poor Susan like my own daughter."</p>
<p>"Thanks, mom," Robbie Ray said softly. Miley, Lilly, Heather and Jackson climbed out of the truck as well, and Ruthie walked over to hug them one by one.</p>
<p>"Hey, mamaw," Jackson greeted her softly.</p>
<p>"It's good to see you, boy," Ruthie answered. She lowered her voice slightly. "Don't ever be afraid to show how you feel, Jackson; if you have tears in you, don't be afraid to let them out." She gave him a small hug and then turned to greet his sister.</p>
<p>"Hi, mamaw," Miley said softly as Ruthie wrapped her arms around her granddaughter.</p>
<p>"Miley, sweetie," Ruthie murmured. "I'm really proud of how well you held up today. I know how much you must miss your poor mother."</p>
<p>"More than anything," Miley whispered, trying not to cry again. She rested in her grandmother's arms for a long, quiet moment. Then she gently pulled away and gestured to her blonde-haired best friend.</p>
<p>"Mamaw, this is my best friend Lilly," Miley introduced her quietly.</p>
<p>"So this is the young lady I've heard so much about," Ruthie said, smiling gently. She held out her arms.</p>
<p>"It's nice to meet you, Mamaw Stewart," Lilly said, smiling a little as Miley's grandmother hugged her.</p>
<p>"Now, Lilly… we're practically family," Ruthie said gently. "It's Mamaw or Ruthie, understand?"</p>
<p>"All right… mamaw," Lilly replied, smiling shyly.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Later, the family gathered together to share a small dinner, and Ruthie told everyone she expected them to clean their plates. Fortunately, her home cooking was hard to resist, and even Miley seemed to eat heartily.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to see you still have your appetite, sweetie," Ruthie said to her granddaughter with a smile.</p>
<p>"I think Lilly wins the prize here," Robbie Ray said playfully. "She's even giving Jackson a run for his money!" Jackson was known to have the biggest appetite in the Stewart family, but Lilly was almost a full helping ahead of him.</p>
<p>"It's not my fault mamaw cooks so good," Lilly said with a grin, trying not to blush. She looked over at her brunette best friend.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling, Miley?" she asked carefully.</p>
<p>"Ok," Miley responded quietly. "It's nice to have a hot, home-cooked meal again." Lilly winced slightly when she realized what Miley was saying. Swallowing, she reached out and gently stroked Miley's back.</p>
<p>"It's gonna be okay, Miley," she said softly. Miley felt tears beginning to sting her eyes again.</p>
<p>"I hope so," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I know so," Lilly replied gently. Miley knew Lilly was only trying to help, and she appreciated it more than words could say, but suddenly her feelings of grief just seemed to overwhelm her, and she lashed out without thinking.</p>
<p>"How would you know, Lilly? You don't know how it feels to lose your mother… to have her just torn from you all of the sudden! You don't know how much it hurts… and you never will!" Tears streaming down her face, Miley jumped up from the table and ran out the back door.</p>
<p>"Miley!" Lilly called after her. She was on her feet in an instant and rushed outside after her best friend. Miley had already made her way to the barn outside, and Lilly found her kneeling in the doorway, sobs shaking her body. Lilly knelt down beside her carefully and quietly slipped a caring arm around her.</p>
<p>"I'm so, <i>so</i> sorry, Miley," she whispered sadly. "You're right… I <i>don't</i> know what you're going through. I just want to help… if you'll let me."</p>
<p>"I'm s-sorry, Lilly," Miley sobbed. "Please d-don't leave me… it just hurts so much!" Lilly felt her heart break, seeing all the grief and pain consuming her best friend, and fresh tears began to trickle down her cheeks as well.</p>
<p>"I wish I could just hold you in my arms, and make the pain go away…" Lilly whispered, her voice breaking. "I know I can't… but I swear I'll always be here for you, Miley! Always!" She wrapped her arms around Miley and pulled her close, burying her face in Miley's long brown hair.</p>
<p>"Always, Miley…" Lilly whispered again, and then she and Miley just sat there on the ground and held each other and cried.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"How's poor Miley doing?" Ruthie asked her son later as they sat on her front porch swing together.</p>
<p>"She's doin' all right, considering," Robbie Ray said quietly. "Lilly's with her."</p>
<p>"Lilly really is a wonderful friend," Ruthie commented. "She cares for Miley a great deal."</p>
<p>"She and Miley are really close," Robbie Ray added. "I don't know if I entirely understand it, but I'm really glad Miley has someone like Lilly in her life." Ruthie smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"Miley's really lucky to have found her," she agreed. She looked over at her son, noticing he had grown quiet.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling?" she asked him softly.</p>
<p>"I don't know," Robbie Ray answered honestly. "How am I supposed to feel, after losing the woman I love?" Though he tried to hide it, he couldn't quite keep the anger out of his voice.</p>
<p>"Exactly the way you're already feeling," Ruthie replied gently, resting a hand on her son's shoulder. "Each of us has to deal with the pain of losing a loved one in our own way."</p>
<p>"I don't know how you did it… when dad passed away," Robbie Ray managed, staring out into the distance.</p>
<p>"I had my moments," Ruthie said quietly. "Just because I just never let you or your brother or your sister see me cry doesn't mean I didn't cry at all. I just knew I had to stay strong, for my family… and in the end, that's what got me through losing your father." When her son didn't respond, Ruthie sighed.</p>
<p>"I know how much you must miss her," she said softly. "I promise, it <i>will</i> get</p>
<p>easier… eventually." Robbie Ray turned to look at his mother, an expression of understanding and respect on his face.</p>
<p>"Thanks, mom," he said softly.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Later that night, in the loft-like room Miley and Lilly were sharing, the two best friends shared a quiet moment together. Although she was no longer crying, Lilly noticed her friend had grown unusually quiet, and she worried what Miley might be thinking about.</p>
<p>"You know I'm right here if you want to talk, Miles," she offered. Miley smiled wearily.</p>
<p>"I know, Lils… and that means a lot to me." She found Lilly's hand and held it tightly in her own.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking about my mom again," Miley said quietly. Lilly gently squeezed the hand she held.</p>
<p>"I understand," she said softly. "I just wish I could help."</p>
<p>"You <i>are</i> helping, silly," Miley replied, "just by being here with me." Smiling a little, she pulled Lilly into a gentle hug. They parted a few moments later, and Lilly looked at Miley thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"What?" Miley asked her, blushing slightly.</p>
<p>"Nothing," Lilly answered. "I was just… thinking about something."</p>
<p>"About me?" Miley asked her.</p>
<p>"Sorta," Lilly answered. "Just an idea I had, really." Miley arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking, whenever you… y'know, think about your mom… maybe it wouldn't be so bad if you had a way to just let them out, instead of trying to keep them inside you."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Lilly?" Miley asked her, not understanding.</p>
<p>"Well… here, how about this…" Lilly turned and reached into her backpack, which she had brought with her. She pulled out a small book, obviously a journal.</p>
<p>"Lilly, is that…" Miley started to ask.</p>
<p>"It was going to be my diary," Lilly explained, "but I want you to have it instead, Miley." She held it out to her best friend.</p>
<p>"Please take it, Miley… you need it more than I do." Miley very carefully took the offered book, smiling a little as she did.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lilly," she said softly.</p>
<p>"That book can be your safe place," Lilly replied. "Any time you start feeling sad about your mother, or even if you just want to have a place to keep your memories of her, you can write them down in that book. No one else ever has to see it; it's yours and yours alone." Miley set the book down on the bed beside her and reached for Lilly, pulling her in for a hug.</p>
<p>"What did I ever do to deserve a great friend like you?" Miley whispered happily. Lilly laughed softly.</p>
<p>"You've just been yourself - and the best friend I've ever had," she whispered back.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>When Lilly awoke the next morning, she was startled to discover Miley was no longer lying beside her in the small bed they were sharing. She sat up quickly, worried something might've happened to her best friend, but her fears faded instantly when she saw Miley sitting near the single window in the room, carefully writing something in the journal Lilly had given her the night before.</p>
<p><i>Looks like she's using it already</i>, Lilly thought to herself. <i>I really hope it helps her…</i></p>
<p>She was startled out of her thoughts when she suddenly heard a soft, beautiful voice raised in song. It took Lilly a moment to realize where the singing was coming from: it was Miley. As she sat there, writing in her new journal, she was singing softly to herself.</p>
<p>"Miley?" Lilly whispered quietly. "Is that you?" She was trying hard not to disturb Miley, not only because she didn't want to intrude on her best friend's quiet moment alone, but secretly she didn't want Miley to stop singing either. There was something about her voice – soft and angelic – that just about took Lilly's breath away. At that moment, Miley suddenly turned around and noticed Lilly watching her.</p>
<p>"Oh! I'm sorry Lilly, I hope I didn't wake you up!" Miley gasped.</p>
<p>"You didn't," Lilly replied, her voice still hushed. "Miley, was that… was that you singing a moment ago?" Miley looked a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she admitted after a moment. "I hope it didn't bother you too much."</p>
<p>"<i>Bother</i> me?" Lilly asked incredulously. "Miley… that was beautiful!" She swallowed.</p>
<p>"You're just saying that 'cause you're my best friend," Miley said with a shy smile.</p>
<p>"I'm saying it because it's true," Lilly responded. "I never knew you could sing like that." She took a breath.</p>
<p>"Have you ever sung before?" she asked Miley quietly. "In front of people, I mean?"</p>
<p>"Just at church," Miley replied. "You know, in the choir."</p>
<p>"You should totally sing for other people," Lilly breathed. She saw the doubt in Miley's eyes. "Seriously, Miles… you have a great voice."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lilly," Miley said quietly, blushing slightly. "I don't think I'm quite ready for that though."</p>
<p>"I understand," Lilly told her. "I still think you should someday, though." She paused for a moment.</p>
<p>"What was that song you were singing, Miles?" she asked curiously. Miley looked uncomfortable for a moment, but it faded quickly. After all, if she couldn't trust Lilly – her best friend – who could she?</p>
<p>"It was… a little song I was writing," she admitted simply. "For my mom."</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean…?" Lilly started to ask. Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"I was taking my best friend's advice," she answered, smiling a little. "Would you… would like to hear it Lilly? It's not finished yet, but…"</p>
<p>"I'd like that," Lilly answered, "if you're sure you're comfortable with that." Miley smiled and nodded, then climbed back in bed beside Lilly and slowly opened her new journal. Taking a deep breath, she began to sing again.</p>
<p>"<i>You used to call me your angel… said I was sent straight down from heaven…</i>"</p>
