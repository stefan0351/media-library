<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Five -->

<p>Brooke was released from the hospital a few days later. Other than the memory loss and her other healing injuries, there was no real reason to keep her there. So she followed her parents into the large unfamiliar house, hanging back slightly with Sam as she walked through the door. </p>
<p>There was a small `Welcome Home Brooke' banner hanging from the ceiling and a small gathering of her `friends' led by Harrison. Brooke groaned. She really wasn't in the mood for this. She knew Harrison was her boyfriend and meant well but he was only succeeding in making her feel smothered. He was trying too hard to make everything all right and to help her remember. It was driving Brooke absolutely crazy. She shot Sam an annoyed look for not warning her. </p>
<p>"Hey, I didn't know," Sam protested with a shrug. "Harrison and I don't exactly talk much." </p>
<p>"Welcome home, Brooke," Harrison said with a wide smile. He gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek that made her uncomfortable. She really didn't like all these strangers touching her. </p>
<p>"Thanks," she mumbled pulling away slightly. The gangs greeted her and innundated her with irritating questions which she did her best to answer without getting snappish. It felt to her like she was at someone else's house, at someone else's party, living someone else's life. Which in a way, she supposed she was. </p>
<p>Throughout the entire ordeal, she kept one eye on Sam who looked as bored as she felt. From what Brooke could gather, Sam and Harrison had once been close friends but had recently had a falling out. She knew that she was somehow the cause of that but no one would clear it up for her. Nicole and Mary Cherry barely gave Sam the time of day but Brooke understood that that was normal. But Lily and Carmen, Sam's longtime friends, were standoffish to Sam as well and that confused Brooke. </p>
<p>(What did Sam do that was so bad?) she wondered quietly. </p>
<p>It was like having a giant jigsaw puzzle but no picture of the complete image. Brooke had snatches of what she was told but no context to put them in.</p>
<p><br>She and Sam were once sworn enemies-Why? Now they were friends-How did that happen?
<br>Nicole tried to run her over-And yet they were still friends, why?
<br>Sam shoved her out of the way of the car-Wow. Why? 
<br>Harrison had chosen her over Sam-Ouch, what kind of damage had that done?</p>
<p>No one seemed willing to answer any of her questions, especially Sam. God forbid Brooke asked her anything remotely personal. The girl shut down tighter than Fort Knox. Brooke had made the mistake of asking Sam about her father only once. The raw pain and vulnerability that flashed across Sam's brown eyes before she could mask it surprised Brooke. She didn't press Sam for any information but rather changed the subject out of respect for the girl. But she did ask Jane about it later and was heartbroken to hear about Joe McPherson's death and how it had effected Sam. It did, however, help her paint a clearer picture of Sam.</p>
<p>"Guys, I appreciate the party, but all I really want right now is to get some sleep," Brooke declared an hour after arriving home. She turned to Sam with a sheepish smile. </p>
<p>"I don't suppose you could show me which room is mine?" she asked. Sam grinned back at her. </p>
<p>"Be glad to," Sam responded. Brooke said her good nights and followed Sam upstairs. Sam led her into a room that was, in Brooke's opinion, Hellishly overdone. </p>
<p>"This is it," Sam announced happily. "Bathroom is through that door and beyond that is my room if you need anything." </p>
<p>Brooke walked around the room picking things up and studying them, hoping some glimmer of a memory would return to her. But nothing did so far. She picked up photos, stuffed animals, sat on the bed, and poked through her closet. It all remained unfamiliar and cold. With a heavy sigh, she walked into the bathroom and poked around there as Sam observed her. Finally, she wandered into Sam's room. </p>
<p>"Nothing to see in here but my mess," Sam joked as Brooke looked around. Sam's room was darker than hers and warmer somehow. It was also, as Sam had warned, a mess. Clothes, papers, and books were literally everywhere with little rhyme or reason. It wasn't slobbish, just chaotic. Or, as Brooke was discovering, pure Sam. </p>
<p>"The clothes hamper is that plastic thing thing over there," Brooke teased as Sam blushed slightly. </p>
<p>"I know that. These," she said picking a t-shirt up off her dresser. "Are my clean clothes." Brooke laughed and sat down on Sam's bed. </p>
<p>"Hmm, softer than mine," she commented absently. Sam shrugged and flopped down in her desk chair. Brooke continued to study the room with interest. </p>
<p>"What exactly do you find so fascinating?" Sam asked curiously a few minutes later. Brooke blinked in surprise. </p>
<p>"You," she answered honestly. Sam frowned in confusion. "Look, Sam, everyone else delights in telling me all about themselves. To the point that I'm actually quite sick of hearing about them. Lily has told me all about her activism and her marriage to Josh. That, by the way, seems like a match made by a blind man." Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"Josh tells me all about how we used to go out together. Which astounds me because I find him about as interesting as wall paper paste. Nicole tells me what a great and fashionable person she is and what great friends we are," Sam snickered at that one and Brooke smiled. "Which doesn't add up since I know she tried to turn me into road chow a while back." </p>
<p>"Carmen goes on and on about cheerleading and eating disorders. By the way, with a body like this, why do I have an image problem?" Sam looked at her with a half-smile and shrugged. </p>
<p>"Harrison, well, I'd rather not talk about him right now. I honestly don't know what I saw in him before the head trauma. And as for Mary Cherry? Well, I don't understand a word she says and frankly she scares me." </p>
<p>"She should," Sam snickered. "But all of that brings us back to me." Brooke nodded and lay on her back staring at the ceiling. She felt oddly at home in Sam's room. </p>
<p>"Right. So everyone tells me everything about themselves and yet you say very little. I don't get it. So it makes me want to figure you out," she explained.</p>
<p>"Suit yourself but I'm hardly a Rubix Cube," Sam sighed. "But honestly Brooke, you could know my entire life story, front to back and still have no clue as to who I really am." Brooke sat up and faced Sam again. </p>
<p>"I don't doubt that," she said softly. "But that's not how I want us to be." Sam shifted uncomfortably in her seat. </p>
<p>"You should be concentrating on getting your memory back, not investigating me," Sam countered gently. Brooke huffed at her. </p>
<p>"My memory either will or won't come back no matter what I do," she argued angrily. "It's not going to kill me to get to know the people who factor in my life until then. Everyone else lets me, you're the only hold out." </p>
<p>"I'm not holding out, Brooke. I just don't think it's that important," Sam told her. </p>
<p>"Well, I do. I depend on you, Sam. I feel safe around you and trust you. I want to get to know you. Please?" she asked. Sam sighed. She really couldn't argue with a request like that. </p>
<p>"OK," she relented seeing that there was no point in arguing with Brooke over something so foolish. But she wasn't going to volunteer any information. She'd answer some questions but that was it. </p>
<p>"So you'll stop fighting me on this?" Brooke asked hopefully. Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"I said `OK', not that I'd bare my soul to you, McQueen. I'll answer your questions honestly but I reserve the right not to answer them if I don't want to." Brooke smiled. It was a small window of opportunity but for the chance to get to know Sam a little better, she'd take what she could get. </p>
<p>"Deal." </p>
