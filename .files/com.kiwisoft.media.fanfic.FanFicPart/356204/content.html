<p>"Well, isn't it everybody's favorite teen journalist Sam McPherson?" Nicole said as she entered the Novak and saw Sam standing in front of the sinks.</p>
<p>"Go to hell Nicole."</p>
<p>"I've already been there, thank you." Nicole approached Sam.</p>
<p>"I'm actually glad I found you here Spam, we need to talk."</p>
<p>"I doubt we have anything to talk about."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I think we do."</p>
<p>Nicole took out Sam's notebook from her bag and held it up in front of the brunette's face. Sam looked at it for a while without really knowing what to do. Should she take it? "Go ahead, take it. It's yours. Be more careful next time."</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly. I've heard about you and Brookie."</p>
<p>"Wha..." Sam frowned then she sighed. "It's none of your business Nicole."</p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong Spam. You made it my business when you started to snoop around my business." Nicole said pointing at the notebook.</p>
<p>"It's not like this is news to anybody, Satan. Everybody knows you are a manipulating bitch. And the rest; well, it comes as no surprise after that sordid attempt at a drag racing career."</p>
<p>"I don't think you should be insulting me now that I am feeling so generous Spam. I came over here to offer you some help to win your loved one back."</p>
<p>"I don't need nor do I want your help. I'm not falling for your little tricks anymore. Your middle name is payback, I'll never forget that."</p>
<p>"I'm not playing you Spam, I just spent the last half hour with your heart broken girlfriend and she said she never wanted to see you again. And besides, I ran over you. You should be the one paying back." Sam looked at Nicole rather stumped. Her tone of voice was not at all familiar. She never thought the blonde could house real feelings in that ice cold heart of hers. However, Sam was softening up because of that desperate feeling inside of her.</p>
<p>"She said that? Where is she?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you that, I promised her. She doesn't know I came down here to talk to you."</p>
<p>"Okay, why are you doing this again?"</p>
<p>"Brookie is my best friend, I love her. I hate to ser her like this and for some odd reason I'm sure you're the only remedy. Anybody can see that, she loves you like crazy. In addition, you do love her, right?</p>
<p>Sam nod.</p>
<p>"And besides, wouldn't you help out a friend in need?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I am not evil." Sam said grinning.</p>
<p>"Okay Spam, do you want your girlfriend back or not?"</p>
<p>Sam had to think about that. Well not the part about getting her girlfriend to speak to her again, but the part where Nicole helps her. Nicole, the same person that more than six moths ago went a little loony and almost ran over Sam's one and only love. Ending up with Sam trying to get Brooke out of the way, Nicole heading right for the wall and taking Sam with her on the way. Brooke had told Sam to just ignore Nicole, not to bother about the past and concentrate on the future. However, that had been impossible for Sam. The last couple of moths (before the whole pregnancy/notebook disappearing thing) Sam had been obsessed with trying to find out why and how Nicole had managed to get away with what she'd done only with therapy and regular visits to the AA. But on second thought that sounded kind of a drag. And Sam had to admit that Nicole had been keeping an unusually low profile their senior year at Kennedy High. No 'Delusions of Grandeur', no bitching around trying to destroy Sam's life. Just... Cheerleading. That's the only thing Nicole had been up to. And she hadn't even tried to take the captain position away from Carmen. She had been happy with co captain. Apparently, everybody in the cheerleading squad pretended like nothing had happened, so why shouldn't Sam? The thought about loosing Brooke over this was just too much for Sam's poor heart, she could already feel it breaking into thousands of small pieces. She decided that, as weird and creepy it might've seemed, she would accept Nicole's help.</p>
<p>"Okay," Sam said, "I'm going home now and try to get a hold on someone from Sunnydale I..."</p>
<p>"From that hell hole?" Nicole frowned.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I uh... have a plan."</p>
<p>"Need help?"</p>
<p>"Maybe... I need you to find Brooke, you know where she is?"</p>
<p>"Maybe..."</p>
<p>"Can you call me when you've found her?"</p>
<p>"You've got is Spam. But I can't promise she'll be happy to see you."</p>
<p>"I'll take care of that." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>Nicole headed for the door when she suddenly turned around.</p>
<p>"Oh, by the way Spam, are you pregnant?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Who's the father?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed. "Brooke."</p>
<p>"Spam, you do need help." Nicole said leaving the Novak with a big grin on her face.</p>
