<!-- World Without Love \ Part 3 -->

<p>Seven startled. As lost as she had been in the song and her emotions she had completely forgotten about B'Elanna being there in the Jeffries tube with her. Then something happened, something that left B'Elanna with her mouth wide open in disbelief. Seven of Nine blushed. She seemed to be embarrased that B'Elanna had witnessed her... yeah her what? Emotional outbreak?</p>

		<p>'Embarrasment is irrelevant', Seven decided but couldn't help the blush. "Yes, Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>"You know Seven, you can call me B'Elanna." That was >not<, what she had intended to said, but she couldn't keep it from coming out of her mouth. Why was it so hard to ask Seven if she was okay?</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna..." she said, slightly uncomfortable with using the other womans given name.</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon decided to try it again. "Seven? Is there something bothering you?"</p>

		<p>"Why would you ask that, Lieu...B'Elanna?" B'Elanna smiled, pleased by the other woman's use of her name.</p>

		<p>"You just seem to be disturbed by something, I mean you sung while wor -"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna tried hard not to get angry, when Seven interrupted her rudely. "I wasn't aware that that is against protocol."</p>

		<p>"It is not and don't try to distract me from the topic on hand. I just want to help you ... I want to be your friend." It was Seven's turn to let her mouth hung open in surprise. Not only was this one of very few offers of friendship she had received since being aboard Voyager (her time as drone not counted), surprisingly it also came from the person from whom she would have least expected it. Although B'Elanna one of the few persons was, Seven actually considered 'worthy' of her friendship. She was brilliant with her engines and most competent, and she was also very beautiful, a fact she herself seemed to be oblivious to, all in all B'Elanna Torres, the half-Klingon Chief engineer of the starship Voyager, came very near to Omega. Seven of Nine appreciated the presence of the feisty Klingon.</p>

		<p>"I want to be your friend, too," Seven answered honestly, "but I don't trust you."</p>

		<p>Now that was brutally honest. 'Typical Seven' B'Elanna thought. "You have the right not to trust me, after all I haven't given you much reason to do so, but I am Klingon, Klingons value friendship greatly and in this respect I am very Klingon." B'Elanna had an almost pleading look on her face. She really wanted to be Seven's friend. Although she herself couldn't quite understand why.</p>

		<p>"Acceptable," Seven said in her best Borg-voice, unconsciously testing, if B'Elanna was able and willing to put up with all of herself, human and Borg. But the engineer seemed to have no problems with that, 'that would be the first time, I should note it in my personal log' Seven thought.</p>

		<p>"So now that this matter is solved ... do you want to tell me what bothers you? Perhaps I could help you."</p>

		<p>"Why are you so certain that something is bothering me?" Seven answered the question with a question trying to avoid the issue. She was not at all comfortable discussing personal matters with other people, not even with Captain Janeway, who she thought of as a friend.</p>

		<p>"Oh come on Seven, don't try to tell me you're fine, I have seen that that is not true," B'Elanna said that, remembering the tear she had seen Seven cry and all the emotion and passion she had laid into the songs.</p>

		<p>"I am experiencing some unsettling emotions. I don't know how to describe it, I think I may be . . . lonely." now she had said what was weighing on her it was not hard to continue, "I miss the unity, the many of the collective. But I don't want to be Borg again, I value being an individual. I just . . . don't want to be alone," Seven considered what she had said a moment and then added, "like you."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was stunned into silence, opening and shutting her mouth without saying anything.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna are you damaged?" Seven asked concerned. B'Elanna ignored the question, but finally said something, rather faintly: "Like me?"</p>

		<p>Seven's enhanced hearing of course picked it up. "Yes, you don't want to be alone, that was the conclusion of my field study of you and Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna remembered the study and how angry she had been about Seven's using her and Tom as objects of her study. She also remembered one sentence, which Seven had written in that study. B'Elanna knew about it, because she had retrieved all material Seven had gathered and read it, of course with the permission of the captain. That particular sentence had her doing some serious thinking about her and Tom's relationship for the last month. Just one sentence in a long, very long study. 'Female shows no signs of romantic feelings for the male.' Seven had recognized in mere days what had B'Elanna taken more than a year. But she knew Seven was right. She loved Tom, she really loved him, but just as a friend. By hindsight she was glad that Tom couldn't care less about the study.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't quite know what to say and decided to use Seven's own words when helpless: "Explain," and then she continued, "there was no conclusion to the study."</p>

		<p>"When I begin something, I always end it. So I wrote a conclusion later, after you had requested and received my material, which is perhaps why you don't know about it. However, I came to the conclusion that you stayed together with Lt. Paris, not because you love him, which you don't , you don't have the symptoms typical for such state of mind," Seven sounded like she thought being in love was a mental illness, B'Elanna thought, "but because you don't want to be alone." Seven concluded.</p>

		<p>All this was said in typical Seven manner, matter of factly and letting no emotions on. B'Elanna shortly wondered how Seven had managed to turn the conversation from being about herself to being about B'Elanna, but this thought quickly submerged in the mass of thoughts and feeling that came crashing down on B'Elanna. 'She is right, she is right ...' sounded her inner voice. B'Elanna sat in the Jeffries tube, slumped down, head on her hands and tried to sort out what repercussions this particular insight would carry with it, when suddenly the Capatin's voice came in over the comm: "Red alert, all hands to battle stations ..."</p>
