<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 8 -->

<p>Kelsey purposely stayed away from the cabin when she knew that Alyssa would be there, coming in late every evening after the woman was already asleep and leaving the cabin early before she woke up. She had thought, if nothing else, her warning had gotten through when she noticed that Alyssa had steered clear of Karen and her bunch until today, when she saw Karen hand the blonde a note which she read and nodded an affirmative reply. Today was the first Port of Call stop in St. Martaan and Kelsey knew that Alyssa was free in the afternoon to go into town with her friends. Kelsey had a sinking feeling that was exactly what the group had planned. She also knew exactly where they would take Alyssa during her first excursion. There were two sides to the island, the French and the Dutch. She knew the group would head to their usual hangout on the French side where the beaches were a bit more colorful, to say the least. </p>
		<p>Finishing her duties, Alyssa hurried back to the cabin to change. She was excited about her first excursion into town. She had never been out of her own state before, let alone to a new country. She was thrilled when Karen had invited her to join them for a beach party. She put her bathing suit on under her shorts and tank top and grabbed her bag with a change of towel and long sleeve shirt, and ran down the corridor toward the launches. Karen, Pam and another woman were waiting for her at the gangway and they boarded the tenders to shore. Climbing toward the back of the launch, Alyssa didn't notice Kelsey until she was seated and the vessel was underway. Kelsey looked briefly at her and then turned away to look out over the water. Alyssa felt a pang of regret, but quickly pushed it down and turned to the group that was already laughing and carrying on.</p>
		<p>As expected, Kelsey saw Alyssa board the tender along with Karen and her usual entourage. She tried not to stare, but caught the blonde's eye briefly before looking away. She kept her eyes focused on the shore until they boat docked and they were going ashore. She could see that Alyssa wore her bathing suit under her khaki shorts and white tank top, and it confirmed her suspicion of exactly where the group was headed as they boarded their bus. As much as she hated to, Kelsey turned and boarded the bus heading in the opposite direction. She just hoped that Alyssa knew what she was doing and would be all right. Kelsey spent the two hours going through the shops and having lunch. Finally, bored with her solo excursion, she headed back toward the ship. She went directly to the cabin and showered and changed before going down to her office to check on things. It was dinnertime and growing dark and Alyssa had yet to return to the ship. The last launches left the island at 7 PM and it was 6 PM already. Kelsey made her way to the deck above the launch docking and looked down at the passengers disembarking and noticed Karen and the other two women, but no Alyssa. She scanned the group and wondered if she had missed the blonde earlier. Heading back down to the cabin, she still found it empty with no sign of her roommate. </p>
		<p>"She's a big girl and can take care of herself. It is not your responsibility to watch every step she takes. She is probably down in one of the crew cabins thumbing her nose up at regulations!" Kelsey paced the cabin talking to herself and reminding her self to stay uninvolved. "You don't need this kind of trouble. Things are just starting to go smoothly and you don't need to get yourself involved with anyone!"</p>
		<p>After a few moments of self-incrimination and berating she spat out, "Bite me!" and went out of the cabin down to the crew's lounge where she found Karen and her crew still partying.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me, have you seen Alyssa?" Kelsey stood her whole 5'10" above the group with her hands on her hips and a no bullshit look on her face. Karen looked up and smiled, but somehow the smile didn't look very receptive.</p>
		<p>"Well, let's see...." Karen drawled in her English accent while a smattering of nervous giggles could be heard from one of the other women with Pam. "You could say we all saw her!" Karen broke out into laughter at that comment and it set Kelsey's blood boiling. She picked up Karen by the collar and pulled her out of her seat sending the chair flying backwards.</p>
		<p>"What did you assholes do to her?" Kelsey's blue eyes were almost black, but Karen was just drunk enough to stupidly see it as a challenge.</p>
		<p>"What the hell is it to you...you don't have exclusive rights to her...or do you?" Karen was grinning and looking over at her friend and winked. "Didn't seem so today, did it Pam?"</p>
		<p>Before anyone had an idea or thought process to answer the question, Kelsey had Karen up against the wall and was definitely 'in her face'. "I'm going to ask you one more time. Where is Alyssa?"</p>
		<p>Karen sobered at the intensity of Kelsey's actions and knew she was playing games with the wrong woman. Her stomach knotted, but she wasn't about to let her friends see her back down to anyone. "How the hell should I know! We were having a party and she split!"</p>
		<p>Kelsey tightened her grip on Karen's shirt and looked Pam directly in the eye. "Is that all?" The woman paled visibly and replied, "We didn't see her when it was time to come back to the ship. I don't think she's come back yet."</p>
		<p>"Damn!" Kelsey swore under her breath and pushed Karen back against the wall and hurried from the room to the launch area. She was at the gangway when she heard someone calling her name and turned to see Pam running toward her.</p>
		<p>"Wait!"</p>
		<p>"What? I don't have time right now!" Kelsey was angry and was ready to throw someone over the side, it didn't really matter whom at this point.</p>
		<p>"Hey, I just want you to know that I tried to stop what was going on, but I was outvoted. We were at the beach sunbathing, you know the nude one.....and everyone was partying and drinking and Karen was trying to get Alyssa drunk again and succeeded in getting her to loosen up enough to go topless. She seemed to be having fun so I didn't think too much of it and then I went with Kellie to get more beer. When I got back, I could tell that Alyssa was upset, she had put her top back on, but I knew something had happened. Karen acted like nothing was going on, I tried to talk to Alyssa but she wouldn't say anything. We were sitting having another beer when the bus pulled up at the stop and Alyssa just jumped up and grabbed her bag and ran for it. I tried to go after her, but Karen said to let her go and I'm sorry, but I did." </p>
		<p>Kelsey watched the woman look away regretfully, but it didn't matter to the tall woman, she was seeing red about that time. "So, you just let her go because Karen told you to? My God woman, don't you have a brain? I don't know what happened, but you can rest assured I'm going to find out and if any of you have done anything to Alyssa....you all had better start growing wings, because someone's leaving this ship without benefit of a ride!" Kelsey turned and walked down the gangway and took a seat. She was only one of two passengers headed back to the island. The crewmembers had been listening to the entire conversation and looked at Kelsey worriedly.</p>
		<p>"Let's go!" She barked and they quickly launched the tender back to shore without comment. </p>
		<p>Kelsey jumped from the boat before it had even been secured and headed down toward town where the buses unloaded. She wasn't sure where to even start looking when she saw blonde hair walking up the street slowly, her head bend looking down at the sidewalk and not where she was going. Kelsey stopped and waited for the woman to reach her without moving or saying a word. Alyssa almost bumped into Kelsey when she realized someone was in front of her looking up and seeing familiar blue eyes was all it took unhinge the blonde and she pushed the tall woman away crying.</p>
		<p>"Well, go ahead! Say it! 'I told you so'!" Alyssa's eyes were red from crying as she spat the words out with a vengeance.</p>
		<p>"Hey, I came looking for you because I was worried, not to reprimand you!" Kelsey tried to keep her voice even to calm Alyssa down.</p>
		<p>"Well, don't worry! I can take care of myself!" Alyssa moved past Kelsey and began walking down the street, this time with a purpose.</p>
		<p>Kelsey turned and in two quick strides had caught up to the woman's shorter legs. "Why are you mad at me...I'm not the one who hurt you!"</p>
		<p>Alyssa stopped dead and swung around to face the taller woman, "Who said anyone hurt me? Is that what they said? What did they tell you?"</p>
		<p>"Easy!" Kelsey replied and grabbed Alyssa by the arm to stop her. This turned out to be a mistake and Alyssa pulled back quickly whispering through gritted teeth, "Don't touch me!"</p>
		<p>"Okay! I won't touch you, but slow down for a moment and talk to me. What the hell happened today?" Kelsey waited for a response from Alyssa, but all the blonde did was turn and begin walking back toward the boats. </p>
		<p>"Alyssa?"</p>
		<p>"I don't want to talk about it. Nothing happened." Alyssa threw over her shoulder and picked up her pace. Kelsey kept right along side easily and kept pushing the issue. "If nothing happened, why are you so angry and why are you out here alone?"</p>
		<p>"What do you need to hear it? Okay, you were right! They weren't nice to me and they aren't my friends, okay! I was just the butt of someone's joke. Does that make you feel any better?" Kelsey could see that there was no reasoning with the woman and just pushed her to board the launch back to town.</p>
		<p>"No, it doesn't make me feel better in the least." Kelsey whispered under her breath and sat down opposite Alyssa and didn't say anything more. The ride back was in done in silence and when they re-boarded the cruise ship Kelsey walked Alyssa back to the cabin and then went in search of some answers.</p>
		<p>Alyssa was glad when Kelsey left, she wasn't in the mood to relive the afternoon's events. It had been Alyssa's first experience at a nude beach and between the beer and the encouragement from the other woman, she had stripped off her top along with the rest of them. It was a wild but exciting experience for her. She had been careful not to drink as much as she had the other night and was feeling slightly buzzed, but no worse. Pam and Kellie left to get more beer, leaving Karen and herself alone on the beach. They group had settled away from the other bathers and Alyssa had been relieved early with the privacy. It wasn't long before she felt a shadow over her and opened her eyes to see Karen leaning over her. Before she could say anything Karen's lips had descended upon hers and she was trying to deepen the kiss. Alyssa hadn't fought the new sensation until Karen's hand began to pinch and roll her nipple hard. It hurt and when Alyssa tried to push Karen off, Karen increased the intensity of the kiss. Finally, pushing Karen away, she sat up breathlessly and grabbed for her top. Struggling into it, Karen watched laughing and remarked, "Oh my God! You're a virgin! Jeez, what are you doing saving yourself for Kelsey? Well, forget it honey...she ain't interested in your type!"</p>
		<p>Alyssa didn't answer, but she could feel her face growing red. Karen continued laughing and when the others had returned she was afraid that Karen would say something and they all would be laughing. As the conversation went on, the tension was building and Alyssa was sure that every time Karen opened her mouth she was about to ridicule her in front of everyone. When Pam asked her if she was all right, she tried to ignore the comment in hopes that Karen hadn't heard it either. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore and when she saw the bus pull up, she just grabbed her things and ran. She didn't care where it was headed as long as it was away from that group. She road around the island the remainder of the day crying and berating herself for being so blind and stupid. What she couldn't explain was the fact that, at first, the kiss hadn't bothered her. It wasn't until Karen had added pain to the sensation that she had reacted against it and Karen. By the end of the day, she was tired, confused and headed back toward the cruise ship wondering just what did Karen meant by, "not interested in my type". Was it women, or me in general? It saddened her to think that it would be either. When she had seen Kelsey and knew she had been looking for her, she had exploded and all her fears had come to the surface. She struck first before she allowed anyone else to hurt her again.</p>
		<p>Alyssa stepped out of shower and dressed for bed, still relieved that Kelsey hadn't come back. Maybe she just didn't want to be with her right now. Whatever, the reason it didn't matter, Alyssa curled up into her bed and made a promise that she wouldn't get involved with anyone, not even as a friend. She would do her job and stay strictly to herself. She fell asleep thinking, '<i>it didn't matter what she did or where she went, nothing would ever change for her. There must be something wrong with me.'</i></p>
