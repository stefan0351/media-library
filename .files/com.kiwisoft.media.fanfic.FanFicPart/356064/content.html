<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Twenty-Two -->

<p>The sun was  beautiful outside, flowing through the window into the room. Noemí lay  with her back against her pillow, propped up against the headrest, the baby  in her arms lying face down over her bare chest. Little Noemí was fully  awake, gazing up at her with wide eyes. Noemí crooned at her, saying  little things to her and patting her diapered butt gently. Little Noemí  kicked out and laughed soundlessly, her body bundled up warmly; she was cheerful  and smiling toothlessly.</p>
		<p>Not really knowing  much about baby care, Noemí had wrapped the baby in her blanket after  changing her wet diaper and now she held her gently in her embrace. Terri drifted  awake, but she didn't move from her stomach-down position, listening to  Noemí's sweet words. She gazed at her through her hair, which lay in  a mat over her face, preventing Noemí from seeing that she was now awake.</p>
		<p>"Do you know  how much I love you and your mommy?" Noemí was saying softly, her voice  sweet and full of love, her eyes full of adoration as she gazed at the child  in her arms. The smile on her face was one that Terri had never seen before.  The sun reflected off her gold-red hair as it fell seductively over her forehead.  "I love you both so much, I wouldn't be able to live without either one of you.  You're both part of my life now, and I'm happy about that." She laughed tenderly  when little Noemí's small head fell to her chest for a rest, and then  drifted up again, her eyes wide and looking up at her again. Her little forehead  crinkled a little as both of her eyebrows arched in her innocent stare.</p>
		<p>"So beautiful,  you and your mommy, and I feel so lucky. You know," She said with an adorable  tone of conspiracy, touching the child's nose with a tender finger. "You remember  what I told you the first time I brought your mommy home with you in her arms?  That I love you and your mommy so much, that's what I told you." A little dribble  of saliva dripped down from the baby's tiny lower lip, and touched Noemí's  chest, leaving a thin band of saliva between her lip and her chest. Adult Noemí  gurgled like a baby and smiled when Terri couldn't stop herself from chuckling  at the beautiful sight.</p>
		<p>Terri lifted  herself up, turning over onto her side, brushing her hair away from her face  and leaning to little Noemí, pressing her lips against her little temple  very gently. The baby turned her head to gaze at her mother, and Terri sat up  and reached for her. "You're going to spoil her." She chided gently as Noemí  sat up and kissed her lips tenderly.</p>
		<p>"Good morning  to <i>you</i>. Or is it afternoon?" She said with a small laugh. She looked  at the clock on the bedside table, and laughed again. "Okay, afternoon." She  corrected herself, kissing her shoulder tenderly. "I personally am very hungry.  Do you want to order out for brunch or something?" She asked softly, inserting  her index finger into the baby's little creamy fist, pulling a little against  her hold. "Strong, isn't she!" She said proudly, leaning down and kissing her  little fingers tenderly. She kissed Terri's shoulder again, and asked: "What  do you say? Order out?"</p>
		<p>Terri shrugged;  she bent her head down to kiss her lips. "Why don't we take showers first,  and then I make something here?" She said instead.</p>
		<p>"Mm, I don't  want to make you cook for me, baby." Noemí said softly, moving closer  to her.</p>
		<p>Terri pulled  her legs together and folded them up, settling the baby comfortably on them.  The baby stared up at her with innocent awe; her little legs kicked excitedly  against her blanket. Terri smiled as she opened the soft bundle Noemí  made with the blanket around the child's body, saying to Noemí gently:  "I think she's warm enough, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Noemí  smiled at her and shrugged. "She was comfortable for a while and then she looked  a little cold, so I bundled her up. Oh, and I changed her diaper too." She said.</p>
		<p>Terri winked  and blew a little kiss at her as she lifted the baby up so that Noemí  could remove the blanket. As soon as they were freed, the tiny legs began to  kick healthily, sticking down straight. Noemí moved closer and nuzzled  her chunky thighs, tickling her with wriggling lips. She moved down to nuzzle  her tiny stockinged feet, chuckling softly. The baby began to kick again, and  caught Noemí on the nose; Noemí fell away, rubbing her nose.</p>
		<p>Terri laughed  and laid the baby along her thighs again, touching her tiny feet with gentle  hands. After a while of laughing, little Noemí began to grow cranky,  redden, then she began to cry; she was obviously hungry by the way she began  to suckle on her own tiny little fist. Terri had fed her early in the morning,  and she had held out long enough. She shifted her gently and cradled her, staring  down at her as she twisted her face this way and that, trying to find her erect  nipple. Soon, her tiny lips were sucking the milk with gusto, her eyes closed  sleepily.</p>
		<p>"I'll order out."  Noemí said, reaching for the phone.</p>
		<p>Terri reached  out with her free hand and grasped her shoulder, stopping her. "No!" She said  in a no nonsense voice, smiling at her. "I really want to cook for you. Now  go take a shower."</p>
		<p>Noemí  stared at her for a moment, smiling mischievously. She moved to the edge of  the bed, and padded naked to the bathroom, Terri's eyes admiringly following  every movement of her strong body.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They ate quietly,  gazing and grinning at each other across the table. Terri had made a delicious  breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon with wheat toast. Noemí munched  happily on her food, gazing at the baby, who sat on a baby seat beside Terri  on the table. She kicked her little fists and laughed that adorable baby cackle.  Terri reached over and touched the baby on her stockinged foot, grinning at  her. Then she moved back and looked at Noemí again, her smile fading  as desire ran through her, and she saw the same look in Noemí's eyes.  She stood up as Noemí stood, and both women moved around the table towards  each other, forgetting about their breakfast.</p>
		<p>They came together  in a passionate embrace, arms wrapped around each other as their lips met. Noemí's  tongue slipped into her mouth, and she moved them towards the refrigerator,  pushing her against it. Terri brought a leg up and wrapped it around Noemí,  feeling Noemí press her hips against hers. She moaned softly, feeling  Noemí's hand slip between them, then between her legs under her long  shirt. Noemí groaned as her fingers slipped into her wetness, and Terri  brought her head forward, pressing her forehead against Noemí's shoulder.  Her fingers dug into her shoulder and her head arched back; Noemí's mouth  came to her throat and her teeth gently nipped on her skin. She moved her head  back and watched Terri's expression as she thrust her fingers in and out of  her wetness.</p>
		<p>Terri's head  was thrown back; her eyes closed in ecstasy, her mouth hanging open. She seemed  unable to moan, and her breath left her in a hiss. When it seemed they wouldn't  be able to stop, Noemí whispered: "Let's go back to bed." She gently  pulled her fingers away from Terri and moved back. Terri's thighs trembled  as she stood on her two feet again. They grabbed the baby seat and hurriedly  made their way to the bedroom, wanting each other with all the passion in the  universe.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Noemí  groaned, looking down and letting her eyes take in the pinkish color of Terri's  very erect nipples, the sensuality of her flat stomach heaving as a soft moan  escaped followed by a long shudder. Noemí was aware of Terri's arms clasped  tightly around her neck, of her fingers brushing through her hair and tightening  convulsively as Noemí's mouth took in a nipple and sucked gently, her  teeth biting very tenderly.</p>
		<p>Terri's body  arched in welcome, her legs spread wide. She grasped Noemí's shoulders  and pushed her down, a gasping plead in her low whimper. Her fingers sifted  through Noemí's wet hair, pulling it hard as a thick moan made her way  through her clamped lips. She couldn't hold any longer, she longed for the silky  feeling of Noemí's mouth and tongue. She couldn't be made love to  slowly; her trembling body was reaching for release.</p>
		<p>Noemí's  lips trailed hot caresses down between her breasts, her stomach, dipping into  her navel and teasing gently. This seemed to have an effect on Terri, who began  to tremble and whimper with more cadences. Noemí smiled at her discovery  and she shifted to lie between Terri's legs, pressing her breasts against the  hot wetness; she began licking and dipping her tongue into Terri's quivering  navel over and over.</p>
		<p>Terri's hips  began a thrusting motion and she lifted her legs to wrap them around Noemí's  torso. Noemí could read the urgency in Terri, in her frantic movements,  in the way she whispered Noemí's name like a breathless chant. Noemí  reached back with an arm and removed Terri's legs from around her body and she  moved down, lifting them over her shoulders. She could feel their immediate  tightening; they urged her mouth towards the dripping wetness that was of her  making.</p>
		<p>Noemí  couldn't resist, her mouth watering even before it opened to the sweet milky  taste of her. Terri's legs tightened convulsively around Noemí, and her  hands pulled at her hair and her body buckled. Noemí's hands were moving  lovingly along her thighs, up to knead the beautiful hips and up more to caress  the beautiful breasts and tease her nipples with gentle fingers.</p>
		<p>Terri's hips  thrust fast against her tongue; helpless cries escaped her lips. The now familiar  tightening pressure began inside her, her breath caught in her throat and her  hips rose in one long pressure against Noemí's hungry mouth, her legs  clamping together around her head. She pressed her lips shut, breathing loudly  and deeply, because she knew that if she allowed her mouth to open, the scream  that would tear through her would frighten her sleeping child.</p>
		<p>"Hmm, oh <i>yes</i>!"  She whispered hoarsely over and over again, grunting as she felt herself reaching  the edge, hovering on the edge, floating there until she couldn't take  any more. She could feel Noemí's expertly coaxing tongue stroking her  so softly now, so tenderly, holding her at the edge of release, licking so slowly  until she couldn't take any more. "Inside! <i>Inside</i>, Noemí!" She  sobbed and was instantly gratified by the smooth inward glide of Noemí's  long fingers against the tightness of her wetness.</p>
		<p>Noemí  pushed Terri's trembling legs from her shoulders, spread them open wider and  held them open with her shoulder as her tongue and fingers taught Terri about  a new way of pleasure. Her fingers glided in and out against the clenching muscles,  her tongue licked, her lips sucked with more force now, aiming without preamble  for Terri's release. Terri threw her head back and grasped Noemí's  hair, pulling her mouth tighter against her. And then release came in the form  of one incredible orgasm followed by more of the same magnitude and stronger.  Her legs fell open weakly and her fingers slipped limply from Noemí's  hair.</p>
		<p>Noemí  licked the nectar from her own lips, her eyes took in the expression of pure  rapture on Terri's beautiful face as ecstasy claimed her like never before,  and she moved up to hold her as her body shuddered and tensed. Noemí  looked down at her sweaty face with the most endearing expression of love and  leaned down to kiss her sweetly on the lips.</p>
		<p>Terri was still gasping,  trying to catch her breath and crying from the joy at the same time. "Oh, God,  Noemí?" She croaked softly and trembled in Noemí's embrace.  Within minutes, she was deeply asleep, her head on Noemí's shoulder,  her face buried in the crook between shoulder and neck.</p>
