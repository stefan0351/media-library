<!-- The Scientific Method \ Chapter 3 - Research -->

<p>"Well someone looks much more chipper after TEN hours of sleep." B'Elanna awarded Harry with a rueful look from as she walked up to a console and called up a status report. "Be careful there Torres, you start getting regular sleep and the Doctor might get worried." B'Elanna found Harry's grin to be infectious as she replied. "Now it's your turn." "Nope, Seven came in and held down the fort while I caught a few hours of sleep. So I am ready to keep going." "Ahh, Seven was in, that explains how so much work got done."</p>

		<p>Harry chuckled softly as he said. "Yep, Seven brought her typical Borg efficiency to fixing the ship." B'Elanna was contemplative as she replied. "Yep Seven does seem quite capable of fixing things, doesn't she?" What she didn't add was how her Klingon senses were able to detect the departed woman's scent long after she left and that scent soothed her into a deep, deep sleep. Even if the dreams she had left her trying to think of a way to set her sonic shower to "cold". "What? Does this mean that you are going to allow her in your engine room?"</p>

		<p>"Harry, I never questioned what she would do, just how she would do it." Now B'Elanna new why she didn't allow herself so much sleep, she got a bit goofy. While she had meant her comment innocently, her mind had already come up with another meaning to her own words. "Well since Seven was kind enough to give us our beauty sleep it's time to put it to use." Speaking up she addressed the entire engineering section. "Alright everyone, we have all been putting in long shifts to put this ship back together, and were almost there. So for the rest of the shift I don't want to see anything but elbows and asses. Let put this thing to bed."</p>

		<p>While Seven strove for honesty at all times she had learned that humans would engage in deceptions, many times with out realizing they were doing so. Regardless of that fact she felt a twinge of guilt as she entered sickbay, but she reminded herself it was only partial deception, and a necessary part of her research. Sickbay was well lit, but empty as she strode through its doors. Tom Paris could be seen through the window of the Doctor's office. The terminal was displaying primitive graphics of a deck of playing cards that he was placing in ordered columns.</p>

		<p>As Seven stepped into the office's doorway she was noticed. "Seven? Was there something I could do for you?" Seven found her normal emotional control comforting as she replied. "I thought I would inquire about your recovery from the experimentation." Paris chuckled lightly as he replied. "You mean the aliens putting a directional control on my libido? Well, the "ingratiating but annoying" hurt, even if it hit a little too close to home, and then there is B'Elanna." While Seven's Borg upbringing never included prayer, she was tempted to offer a prayer up to the Omega particle that her expression remained unchanged when Paris mentioned B'Elanna's name."</p>

		<p>Don't get me wrong, I like B'Elanna, I do. I mean she's quite the beauty, especially when she's angry. While there is the matter of her temper she is also REALLY protective. Sort of a "I may mess with you, but no one else will." kind of thing. Hell, if the aliens hadn't stepped in I may have tried for her anyway, but then she's also so willful! I mean I like to think of myself as easy going, which does not work with her. She would be better suited with Chakotay, or Captain Janeway. Someone just as stubborn as she is." Seven's eyebrow arched in it's own silent question as she spoke."</p>

		<p>You think Captain Janeway would be a suitable mate for B'Elanna?" Paris looked a bit confused, but didn't let that keep him from replying. "Well, yeah. I mean it was before you joined the crew, but B'Elanna was having a hard time adjusting to Starfleet discipline. Captain Janeway "tamed the shrew" then. She seems a natural to be with B'Elanna, and here in the 24th century it is considered natural for women to be able to be with other women, you know, romantically." Seven spoke simply. "I am aware that same sex couplings are considered acceptable. I just felt that Lieutenant Torres deserves more in a partner then someone who can keep her under control."</p>

		<p>Seven kept her expression impartial, as Tom's face seemed to be contemplating something. "I thought we were discussing my recovery from the experiments." Seven had her voice in its typical tone as she said. "I have learned humans diverge off topic regularly. I simply did not want to inconvenience you." Paris seemed to have a partial grin as he spoke. "Thank you Seven, I guess I could say the aliens didn't make me do anything I didn't really want to. They just made me do it before I would have on my own. Though on the topic of B'Elanna? did you ask her how she was holding up?"</p>

		<p>While her Borg conditioning had been failing her as of late Seven felt it suddenly respond to the current discussion. "Lieutenant Torres said she was still sorting through her feelings. Which is one of the reasons I wished to speak. I had hoped you would be able to offer insights into her feelings, as well as my own." Paris seemed to let his grin form as he motioned Seven to a chair. "Why didn't you say so, the doctor is in." Even as she sat Seven felt confused. "I thought the Doctor was currently deactivated." Paris grinned and patted her on the shoulder.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>B'Elanna and Harry were in one of the Jefferies tubes as she took a breath and steeled herself. "Hey Harry, there was something Tom mentioned, but never got to finish telling me about. What happened with you and Seven when you were working on astrometrics?" Harry's face shot up, and then hung down. "I should have known Tom would have told you about that." B'Elanna knew more then she was letting on, but she figured Harry would be able to give her a first hand account."</p>

		<p>I thought I would invite Seven to a intimate little "business" dinner in the mess hall. She clinched on the business in business dinner." Harry seemed to brace himself for the next part. "Then she asked me if I wanted to change the nature of our affiliation. She lists my pupils dilating when looking at her, inviting her to the holodeck to watch the Ktarian moonrise. She then asks me if I am in love with her, and when I say no? she asks me if I want to copulate."</p>

		<p>At Harry's pause B'Elanna's control slipped and she started laughing. She was afraid she would be jealous? but poor Harry.</p>

		<p>"I hope not you cad. Having sex with someone you are not in love with!</p>

		<p>"Harry made a face at B'Elanna and sighed before finishing his story. "She decided that while humanity was confusing to her she was willing to explore her humanity, and then told me to take off my clothes."</p>

		<p>She felt that jealousy hit full force as she asked. "What did you do?" "I ran, I stammered SOMETHING out, and I ran." B'Elanna shook her hand and patted Harry on the back.</p>

		<p>"It's ok Harry, you would have to be ready for that kind of thing." "Oh, I hadn't had a chance to thank you." Tom Paris looked up from the tray he was placing his lunch on to look at his best friend Harry Kim. Seeing what passed for Harry's "angry" look he grinned. "Thank me, for what?" The pair finished with their trays and took a table before Harry continued in hushed tones. "For blabbing to B'Elanna about me making an idiot out of myself with Seven." Instead of the laughter he expected Harry saw his friend seemed to be thinking, and he started to worry. His friend then got a mournful look and patted him on the shoulder."</p>

		<p>I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but if I am right, then you probably should know. If I turn out to be wrong, well then the noose is around my neck and not yours. Seven came to sickbay today asking me about B'Elanna." Harry's eyes got wide and his voice stayed hushed. "Are you saying? Seven's interested in B'Elanna?" Paris was grinning now. "I think it's safe to say the Borg's got it bad. While she was her typical self the fact she was asking for advice on such a "irrelevant" thing says a lot." Harry looked downcast, but nodded."</p>

		<p>Hey buddy, I'm sorry I had to break the news to ya." Harry shook his head. "No, I kinda figured I blew my chances in that blaze of idiocy. I figured she would wind up with someone else soon enough. I actually thought it could be you." Paris threw his friend a confused look as he replied. "Me, but I was with B'Elanna." Harry just returned an arched look. Paris was abashed, but laughing. "Hey!" After several moments the pair settled down and Harry continued. "So what did you tell Seven?"</p>

		<p>"That with B'Elanna you could never tell, she'll tell you. I was hesitant to give her much more then that, but I am not so sure now." Harry looked up from his plate while he was eating. "What do you mean?" "Well? I didn't want Seven to get hurt. I mean Vorik was humiliated after that whole Pon Farr thing, and he at least has experience in dealing with emotions. Even if it is just to suppress them. Seven on the other hand is totally new to her feelings. I know B'Elanna would never do anything to deliberately break someone's heart, but it could really damage Seven so early in her development."</p>

		<p>"Woah, that's actually insightful." Paris pointed a finger as he said. "Hey, I can be insightful." He then grinned. "If I try hard enough. Anyway, if B'Elanna is interested in Seven it could be just the thing for both of them." Harry looked confused. "What makes you think B'Elanna is interested in Seven?" "Harry, she knew all about the story, I mean I told her all about it. Her asking you was an information gathering expedition. Which is exactly why she needs Seven, she needs someone who can smooth out those rough edges. While Seven needs someone who can teach, protect and nurture that emotional growth. I was thinking of getting her a pet, but I guess B'Elanna will do just as well." At that Harry startled laughing while a confused Tom started at him.</p>
