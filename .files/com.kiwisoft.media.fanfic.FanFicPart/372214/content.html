<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER TWENTY ONE</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">CHOICES</p>
<p>It was late at night when the graduation party at the Stewart house finally came to an end, but Miley and Lilly were still wide awake. They stood together, alone, on the back porch, talking and reminiscing… and just enjoying one another's company.</p>
<p>"Can you believe we finally made it?" Lilly asked excitedly.</p>
<p>"I know," Miley replied with a grin. "Sure doesn't feel like twelve years have gone by already."</p>
<p>"I'm not complainin'," Lilly said cheerfully. "No more teachers, no more books…"</p>
<p>"Until we start college," Miley pointed out, her smile widening.</p>
<p>"Party pooper," Lilly retorted, sticking her tongue out.</p>
<p>"Don't stick that thing out at me, Truscott," Miley said playfully, wagging a finger at her best friend. "Unless you're prepared to use it," she added under her breath, her eyes sparkling with mischief.</p>
<p>"Ooh, feelin' saucy today, huh?" Lilly shot back, arching an amused eyebrow. "Keep it up, Stewart… you just might get your wish!"</p>
<p>"Don't make promises you can't keep," Miley retorted, still grinning.</p>
<p>"Who says I can't?" Lilly continued, unwilling to lose their playful little game. She leaned forward and kissed Miley gently, tangling her fingers in her girlfriend's long brown hair.</p>
<p>"You don't play fair," Miley whispered when they parted a few moments later.</p>
<p>"Nope," Lilly replied with a wink. "And just think, once we're on our own at college, we can do this anytime we want."</p>
<p>"I thought you didn't want to go to college," Miley teased her best friend.</p>
<p>"As long as I'm with you, I'll go anywhere," Lilly replied softly. The distant sound of thunder rolled across the darkened sky overhead. A few moments later, raindrops began to fall all around them.</p>
<p>"A summer storm," Miley said softly. Her smile grew wider, and she reached out to take Lilly's hand in her own.</p>
<p>"C'mon," she said to her best friend.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" Lilly asked. "In case you hadn't noticed Miles, it's raining!"</p>
<p>"I know," Miley replied softly. "I want to dance in it… with you." Lilly opened her mouth to say something, but Miley was already pulling her out into the rain, a radiant smile on her face.</p>
<p>"You're crazy, you know," Lilly said, smiling as well.</p>
<p>"Yup," Miley agreed happily. "Crazy for you." Then she pulled Lilly close, kissing her passionately as they began to dance. The rain continued to fall, gradually soaking them both to the skin, but neither seemed to care. They continued to sway gently together, reveling in their love for each other and just enjoying the moment. Miley extended her arm, slowly spinning Lilly around, then pulled her back in close, kissing her once again.</p>
<p>"I love you, Lilly," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I love you too," Lilly whispered back, and she kissed Miley fiercely again. The passion between them quickly grew into a burning hunger, a need for each other they couldn't deny.</p>
<p>"I want you…" Lilly breathed, kissing her way gently down Miley's neck.</p>
<p>"Barn…" Miley whispered urgently. As badly as she wanted Lilly too, there was no way she was going to try to make love to her girlfriend inside, while her father and brother were home. Instead, she tugged Lilly towards the Stewart family's small barn. It was dimply inside, and the horses whinnied quietly as the two young lovers walked past them, heading for a simple wooden ladder in one corner of the barn. They climbed it in silence, hands still joined, and eased themselves down onto the small hayloft above.</p>
<p>"Good thing we left the blanket up here when we went stargazing last time," Miley whispered with a smile.</p>
<p>"Mmm-hmm…" Lilly breathed, capturing Miley's lips in another kiss. Then there were no more words, as the two young women gave in to their love and desire for each other once again.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Much later, Miley lay in her bed with Lilly by her side, holding the young woman she loved more than life itself in her arms. Lilly was sleeping soundly, a contented smile on her face, snuggled against her best friend with her hands tangled in Miley's long brown hair. Miley herself, however, was still wide awake. She stared up at the ceiling, lost in her thoughts; thoughts focused entirely on the beautiful young woman lying in her arms.</p>
<p>Miley already knew she wanted to spend the rest of her life with Lilly; she'd known that since the day after their prom, when they'd reminisced about their past, dreamed of their future together… and then made love for the second time ever. Now, with their future rising to meet them, Miley found herself growing anxious to start their lives together. She wondered what her father and the others would say; they accepted her and Lilly's relationship, but how would they feel about them actually getting married? After all, they were still only seventeen. Would Lilly even say yes? Miley believed with all her heart that Lilly would – there was no doubt in her mind that Lilly loved her – but the nagging doubts wouldn't leave her alone.</p>
<p>Finally, with a frustrated sigh, Miley carefully disentangled herself from her still sleeping girlfriend – being careful not to wake her – and quietly slipped downstairs. She was startled to see the light in the kitchen was still on, and even more startled to see her father standing there, attempting to make a pot of coffee.</p>
<p>"Daddy?" she called out softly.</p>
<p>"Hey, bud," Robbie Ray greeted his daughter softly. "Couldn't sleep?"</p>
<p>"You either, I guess," Miley replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Just havin' one of those nights," Robbie Ray said lightly. Miley frowned, not understanding.</p>
<p>"Are you okay daddy?" she asked him carefully.</p>
<p>"I'm all right, bud," Robbie Ray assured her. "I just… well, it ain't important."</p>
<p>"Daddy… we promised we'd be honest with each other, didn't we?" Miley asked her father solemnly. Robbie Ray sighed.</p>
<p>"Sometimes darlin', you remind me so much of your mother it ain't funny," he said with a sad smile. "You're not gonna let this go, are you?" Miley responded by folding her arms over her chest. Robbie Ray chuckled.</p>
<p>"I'll take that as a no," he laughed softly. "All right, all right… I give up. If you really wanna know… I was havin' another dream about your mother." Miley's eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"I have them sometimes," Robbie Ray explained, turning back to the coffee pot again. "They're not bad dreams, really; usually they're just about the past, and how things were before… well, y'know." He shrugged.</p>
<p>"I guess it's my way of still hangin' on to her… even after all these years. I can never get back to sleep afterwards though; somethin' about wakin' up in that big ol' empty bed all by myself."</p>
<p>"Daddy…" Miley whispered, her heart aching for her father. Her own troubles seemed to vanish, and in an instant she was at her father's side.</p>
<p>"It's all right bud, really," he said simply, pausing to pour two scoops of coffee into the pot.</p>
<p>"It's <i>not</i> all right," Miley interrupted, tears beginning to sting her eyes. "Momma wouldn't want you to do this to yourself."</p>
<p>"I know," Robbie Ray said with a sigh. "I guess some wounds just take longer to heal than others." He added water to the pot and plugged it into the wall socket behind it. He turned around again, only to be enveloped in a loving hug by his daughter. Robbie Ray hugged her back, smiling warmly at her concern for him.</p>
<p>"I'll be okay, bud," he said softly. "After all, I've got you and Lilly and your brother to keep me goin'… if ya'll don't drive me crazy first." He smiled then, and Miley hugged him tighter.</p>
<p>"I love you, daddy," she whispered. "You know I'll always be here for you."</p>
<p>"I love you too, baby girl," Robbie Ray replied. "I always will." He pulled away gently so he could look at his daughter again.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I'm more concerned about you," he said gently. "How come <i>you</i> couldn't sleep, bud?"</p>
<p>"I just… couldn't stop thinking about something," she admitted. She had been so concerned about her father, she had all but forgotten about what had been bothering <i>her</i> before.</p>
<p>"About what?" Robbie Ray asked her gently. "Is everything okay?" Miley took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Daddy… I want to ask Lilly to marry me." Robbie Ray blinked, taken aback for a moment.</p>
<p>"Miles…" he started to speak, but the words wouldn't come to him. Finally, he simply spoke the first words to come to his mind. "Baby girl, you're awfully young to be thinkin' about such things…"</p>
<p>"How old were you when you and momma got married?" Miley asked him softly.</p>
<p>"How did I know you were gonna ask me that?" Robbie Ray asked with a soft chuckle. He sighed. "I was pretty young… we both were. Your momma's parents weren't too happy with me either."</p>
<p>"Why not?" Miley asked him curiously.</p>
<p>"Let's just say they weren't quite ready to be grandparents yet," Robbie Ray said lightly. Miley's eyes widened.</p>
<p>"You mean…?"</p>
<p>"Well, you know your brother had to come from <i>somewhere</i>," Robbie Ray replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"I, um… I never realized…" Miley managed to get out, caught somewhat off guard by her father's admission. "Well, that's one thing you definitely don't have to worry about with me and Lilly."</p>
<p>"I hope not," Robbie Ray quipped.</p>
<p>"I just… I know she's the one, daddy; the one I want to spend the rest of my life with."</p>
<p>"I believe you darlin'," Robbie Ray said. "I can see with my own eyes how much you two love each other, and you know I'm really happy for the both of you."</p>
<p>"But…?" Miley pressed him.</p>
<p>"You can stop actin' like your momma any time now," Robbie Ray laughed softly, shaking his head. "All right… <i>but</i>, marriage is a big step, Miles; you're promisin' yourself to someone else for the rest of your life. It's not always easy, either. Believe me, I know."</p>
<p>"I know," Miley admitted quietly. "I'm willin' to give myself to Lilly forever, daddy. I'll do whatever it takes to make her happy… and I know she'll do the same for me."</p>
<p>"You really certain this is what you want, bud?" Robbie Ray asked after a moment. Miley fixed her father's deep brown eyes with her own cerulean gaze and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>"Daddy… I love her."</p>
<p>"Then that's enough for me, bud," Robbie Ray said softly. "I know Lilly's a good person, and I know how happy she makes you. If this is what you want… then you have my blessing." Smiling so wide it nearly split her face, Miley leapt into her father's arms, hugging him fiercely.</p>
<p>"Thank you daddy!" she gushed. "I love you so much!"</p>
<p>"I love you too, baby girl," Robbie Ray said with a smile, hugging his daughter warmly. They remained in each other's embrace for several long moments, then Robbie Ray slowly pulled away.</p>
<p>"So… when are you plannin' to pop the question?" he asked his daughter with a smile.</p>
<p>"I, uh… I don't know yet, daddy," Miley managed. "I guess I better find a ring for Lilly first." She grinned.</p>
<p>"Wanna take me shopping?"</p>
<p>"I'd love to darlin', but we may not have much time… or have you forgotten you're supposed to go visit your Grandma Ruby in two days?"</p>
<p>"Sweet niblets, I did forget," Miley muttered.</p>
<p>"Well, Lilly's going with you," Robbie Ray suggested. "Maybe you can do something special for her while you're away." Miley's eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>"Daddy, you've just given me a great idea!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"It's so good to see you again, grandma!" Miley exclaimed as she hugged her Grandma Ruby tightly. "I've missed you so much!"</p>
<p>"I've missed you too, sweetheart," Ruby Greene said softly as she hugged her beloved granddaughter. "Lordy but you look like your momma when she was your age!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, grandma," Miley said with a sad smile.</p>
<p>"I miss her too, honey," Ruby replied, love shining in the depths of her soft brown eyes. She ran a gentle hand through her granddaughter's long brown hair.</p>
<p>"So I hear there's something important you wanted to tell me?" Ruby asked warmly, gesturing to the familiar blonde tomboy standing beside Miley as always, holding her hand. Miley smiled and gently squeezed the hand holding hers.</p>
<p>"Grandma, you remember my best friend Lilly?" Miley replied.</p>
<p>"Why of course I do," Ruby greeted her. "It's nice to see you again, Lilly." Lilly had actually met Ruby six years ago, at Susan Stewart's funeral. Although the older woman had been both friendly and welcoming then, Miley's maternal grandmother was not yet aware of their relationship, and both young woman were somewhat concerned about how she might react once she learned the truth.</p>
<p>"Grandma… <i>she's</i> the one I wanted you to meet. Lilly and I… we're in love."</p>
<p>"With each other, she means," Lilly added helpfully.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" Ruby asked with a smile. "Here I thought it was gonna be somethin' bad, as nervous as you two were actin'!" She reached out to hug Miley again, then gestured for Lilly to join them as well.</p>
<p>"You're… okay with it, grandma?" Miley asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I be?" Ruby replied, smiling gently. "I know there are people out there who call it a sin and worse, but I'm not that closed minded, sweetheart… if you two are happy, then so am I."</p>
<p>"…and if anyone gives you trouble, you tell 'em to come see me… I'll give 'em an earful!" she laughed. Miley and Lilly both laughed with her.</p>
<p>"Thank you, grandma," Miley managed, her eyes sparkling with happy tears. "I love you."</p>
<p>"I love you too, sweetheart… both of you."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Ruby Greene lived on a decent-sized farm of her own in the nearby neighboring town of Crowley Corners. Miley could remember spending summers there when she was little, playing hide and seek with her brother Jackson and going swimming in a secret swimming hole they had found nearby. As Ruby's pickup truck rumbled up the long dirt road leading to her farm, Miley grew more and more excited as she thought of all the things she planned to share with Lilly during their two week visit.</p>
<p>"You and Lilly can stay in your momma's old room," Ruby said as they pulled up to the house and stopped.</p>
<p>"Okay grandma," Miley replied softly. Lilly could feel Miley tense beside her, though she tried to hide it.</p>
<p>"Are you okay, Miles?" Lilly whispered to her. Miley nodded slightly.</p>
<p>"I will be," she whispered back. A few minutes later, the girls and Ruby climbed out of the old pickup and Miley and Lilly hauled their luggage upstairs to the room they'd be staying in. The room itself was small and simple, with little more than a large double bed and a dresser with a small vanity. Resting on one corner of the vanity was a small picture showing a familiar looking young woman with reddish brown hair holding a small baby, both of them smiling happily.</p>
<p>"Grandma took that picture of momma and me just after I was born," Miley said softly, coming up behind Lilly, resting her head gently on her girlfriend's shoulder. "I haven't seen it in a long time…" There was a slight tremor in her voice, one that Lilly had come to know well.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" she asked carefully. She heard Miley sniffle softly.</p>
<p>"I miss her," Miley replied softly.</p>
<p>"I know," Lilly replied. She turned and wrapped her arms around Miley in a warm hug. "I'm right here if you need me, Miles."</p>
<p>"I'll be all right," Miley said calmly.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should do something fun, to get your mind off things," Lilly suggested. "Any ideas?" she added with a smile. Her infectious smile brought a matching grin to Miley's face as well.</p>
<p>"Thanks Lil, but it'll have to be later," she said warmly. "Right now we have to help Grandma at the farmer's market."</p>
<p>"She works at the farmer's market?" Lilly asked.</p>
<p>"She runs it," Miley explained with a smile. "She also sells her prize-winning watermelons there."</p>
<p>"And I could use a couple of strong young bodies to carry 'em for me," Ruby added. Miley looked up to see her grandmother standing in the doorway, a friendly smile on her face. "You two ready?"</p>
<p>"We're comin', Grandma," Miley replied warmly. She turned and extended her hand to Lilly, smiling again.</p>
<p>"Come on, Lils… work first, play later!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"These things weigh a ton!" Lilly grumbled as she carried yet another watermelon over to Ruby's table at the town farmer's market.</p>
<p>"Tell me about it," Miley agreed, setting another melon on the table.</p>
<p>"You two sure do complain a lot," Ruby said teasingly. "Haulin' my prize-winners oughta be easy for young strong things like you!" She smiled warmly.</p>
<p>"Now, the sooner you help me get some samples ready, the sooner you two can go have some fun," she said gently. Ruby reached into the ice chest she'd brought with her and pulled out a large knife, which she used to begin slicing up one of the fresh watermelons.</p>
<p>"Put those slices on a plate to offer to people," she instructed her granddaughter. "Lilly honey, how good a salesman are you?"</p>
<p>"Um… I don't know?" Lilly replied, not quite understanding.</p>
<p>"Let's see if you can't convince these hungry people to come try some nice fresh watermelon," Ruby continued, smiling widely. She handed Lilly the plate Miley had prepared.</p>
<p>"Now let's hear it, Lilly!" Ruby called out. Lilly looked over at Miley, sharing a nervous grin, then she turned her attention back to the steadily growing crowd.</p>
<p>"All right everybody!" Lilly shouted. "Come be the first to try Ruby Greene's prize-winning watermelons! One taste and you'll be hooked!" Grinning, she looked back at Ruby and Miley.</p>
<p>"How was that?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I think you can do better," Ruby said with a smile. She turned to look at her granddaughter.</p>
<p>"What do you think, Miley?" Ruby asked her. Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"C'mon Lils, really give 'em an earful!" she shouted playfully. Lilly couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Okay, but you asked for it!" she shouted back. She cleared her throat and turned back to face the growing crowd again.</p>
<p>"COME ON, FOLKS! THIS IS THE BEST WATERMELON YOU'VE EVER TASTED! ONE BITE AND YOU'LL THINK YOU'VE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN!" Miley laughed out loud, and soon both Lilly and Ruby were laughing as well. Watching as crowds of people began to line up to taste Lilly's samples, Ruby smiled again.</p>
<p>"Now that's more like it!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>After the excitement of the farmer's market, Miley and Lilly decided to relax. At Miley's insistence, they changed into their swim suits and walked a short distance to a place all but hidden within the towering forest of pine trees near Ruby's farm. There, alongside a sparkling mountain stream, was a small waterfall cascading down over a series of rough rock steps. The pool of rushing water below it had once been Miley and Jackson's childhood swimming hole, and it remained a very special place for them. Together, Miley and Lilly now enjoyed splashing about in the same pool - frolicking, playing and otherwise just enjoying being together, as they always did.</p>
<p>"You'll never take me alive!" Miley shouted, giggling madly. She ducked behind a rock, narrowly avoiding another attempt by Lilly to splash her, then darted out to catch Lilly with another watery attack of her own.</p>
<p>"All right Stewart, you're goin' down!" Lilly laughed. She lunged forward, pushing her hands and arms out in front of her, generating a huge splash that all but drenched her already soaking wet girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Aaaahhhh! All right, all right, I surrender!" Miley laughed out loud. "Jeez Lils, you're worse than Jackson!" Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"So what do you offer me to accept your surrender?" she asked playfully. Pushing her soaking wet bangs away from her face, Miley stared thoughtfully at Lilly for a long moment. Then a small smile worked slowly worked its way onto her face. She cast a quick look over her shoulder, then to either side.</p>
<p>"Well…" she said softly, dropping her voice to nearly a whisper. "Ever been skinny dipping, Lils?" Her eyes sparkled with something Lilly couldn't quite place.</p>
<p>"You're kidding, right?" Lilly managed to reply.</p>
<p>"Why, you afraid?" Miley playfully teased her.</p>
<p>"Miles, this water's freezing as it is!" she gasped. "Besides, what if someone sees us?"</p>
<p>"There's no one around for miles, Lils… and no one's ever found this place except Jackson and me." She arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Besides… it'll be <i>fun</i>," she said seductively. Lilly immediately felt her mouth go dry.</p>
<p>"You, Miley Ray Stewart, are <i>bad</i>," she laughed nervously. "A-all right… but you go first." Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"Sure," she replied. She took a step back, and with a final furtive glance over her shoulder, quickly undid her bikini top. She held it in place for a few moments, giving Lilly a look that set her insides on fire, then tossed it onto one of the rocks nearby. Lowering herself into the water again, she reached down and removed her bottoms as well, holding them up to show her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Your turn," she whispered, tossing them over to join the other half of her discarded bathing suit. Lilly nervously removed her suit as well, blushing madly when Miley let out a wolf whistle.</p>
<p>"Stop it," she managed with a smile.</p>
<p>"Sorry, couldn't help myself," Miley replied with a grin of her own.</p>
<p>"These better still be here later," Lilly muttered, turning around just long enough to set her own suit near Miley's.</p>
<p>"You worry too much," Miley said, swimming up behind her best friend and putting her arms around her. "Now it's just you and me…"</p>
<p>"And a whole lot of ice cold water," Lilly said dryly. She shrieked when Miley suddenly ran her fingers along her ribs, tickling her. She quickly spun around.</p>
<p>"You are <i>so</i> gonna get it for that!" she laughed.</p>
<p>"Gotta catch me first," Miley quipped.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll catch you," Lilly said, mock threateningly. She chased after Miley, eventually tackling her into the cold water with a huge splash.</p>
<p>"Give up?" Lilly asked, smirking in triumph.</p>
<p>"How do you know I'm not gonna tickle you again?" Miley replied, arching an amused eyebrow.</p>
<p>"What makes you think I'm gonna let you try?" Lilly retorted, her grin widening. She moved forward slightly so she could straddle Miley.</p>
<p>"Um… Lils…" Miley struggled to speak. "Not that I'm not enjoying this, but…"</p>
<p>"What, not having fun anymore?" Lilly asked with amusement.</p>
<p>"Trust me, that's not the problem," Miley managed. "I'm thinkin' exactly the opposite."</p>
<p>"Miley… we're outside… out in the <i>open</i>…" Lilly stressed.</p>
<p>"So maybe we should go inside now," Miley suggested, smiling weakly.</p>
<p>"All right," Lilly managed. "We should probably get our suits first, though… unless you want to walk back to your grandma's <i>naked</i>."</p>
<p>"I'll pass, thanks," Miley said with a soft laugh. "Come on, let's…" She stopped abruptly, her eyes catching sight of the small rock shelf where they had left their swimsuits… which were suddenly no longer there. Her eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>"Miles?" Lilly asked, concerned at the sudden change in her best friend's expression. "What is it? What's wrong?" Noticing where she was staring, Lilly turned to look as well… and her jaw dropped open.</p>
<p>"You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me…" she whispered. She whirled around to face Miley again.</p>
<p>"Where are our suits Miley?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Miley whispered. "Maybe something ate them?"</p>
<p>"That's not funny Miles!" Lilly exclaimed. "What are we supposed to do now?"</p>
<p>"I, um… I guess we'll have to walk back to grandma Ruby's. The rest of our clothes are there…" Miley managed.</p>
<p>"Miley, we're naked!" Lilly hissed.</p>
<p>"I kinda noticed that, Lils," Miley muttered.</p>
<p>"Well, we can't just walk back to your grandma's house naked!" Lilly insisted.</p>
<p>"No one would see us," Miley pointed out. "If we're quick…"</p>
<p>"Hel-lo, Miles! We're <i>naked</i>!" Lilly argued. "We're not wearing <i>anything</i>, remember?"</p>
<p>"I know that, Lils! What do you want me to do?" Lilly closed her eyes.</p>
<p>"I really, <i>really</i> hope no one sees us…" she managed.</p>
<p>"Would it help if I promised we'll never have to go skinny dipping again?" Miley said sadly.</p>
<p>"I'm not mad at you, Miles," Lilly answered. "I just can't believe we've gotta do this!"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what," Miley offered. "I'll go first and you can hide behind me, okay?"</p>
<p>"I still don't believe this," Lilly muttered. "All right Miles, I just hope no one sees us!" They crept carefully out of the pool, covering themselves as best they could, and hurried over to the shade of a nearby tree.</p>
<p>"Grandma's house is only about five minutes away," Miley said quickly. "We can do this, Lilly!"</p>
<p>"Let's just get this over with!" Lilly replied. Miley reached back to take her hand, and together they began to run. As Miley had suggested, it didn't take them long to get back to her Grandma Ruby's house, but then a new problem presented itself.</p>
<p>"Whose car is that?" Lilly whispered to her best friend.</p>
<p>"I think…it's my cousin Grace's car," Miley whispered back.</p>
<p>"Great, now what do we do?" Lilly exclaimed.</p>
<p>"We go around back," Miley responded. "Come on, quick!" Still holding hands, Miley and Lilly ran around the back of the house and darted inside the patio door.</p>
<p>"Miley, Lilly, is that you?" Ruby called out, hearing the screen door slam shut.</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah Grandma, it's us!" Miley managed, while Lilly squeezed her hand in alarm. "We're uh, just going upstairs to change!"</p>
<p>"Come say hello to your cousin first!" Ruby shouted back. Lilly's eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>"Oh, just kill me now," she whispered.</p>
<p>"We're not decent, Grandma!" Miley replied, and before Ruby could argue again, they rushed upstairs together.</p>
<p>Later that night, Miley and Lilly sat together around a small campfire not far from Ruby Greene's house, relaxing and trying to recover from the day's unusual events.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"So, are you having a good time so far Lils?" Miley asked her best friend.</p>
<p>"Let's see," Lilly replied, mock seriously. "I had to carry twenty pound watermelons halfway across town and back, I nearly froze to death trying to swim without a suit, and then I had to run back your grandma's house starkers 'because of someone's <i>brilliant</i> idea to go skinny dipping!" She grinned.</p>
<p>"Of course I'm having fun; I'm with you."</p>
<p>"Hey, at least things are never boring when we're together," Miley offered with a smile.</p>
<p>"Got that right," Lilly agreed, laughing. "I wouldn't give it up for anything."</p>
<p>"Me either," Miley said, her voice growing husky with emotion. "In fact… I don't ever wanna give <i>you</i> up; not for anything."</p>
<p>"Oh, Miley…" Lilly whispered. She slid up beside Miley and wrapped her arms around the woman she loved, resting her head on Miley's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miley… with all my heart." She smiled. "Even when you've got me running naked halfway across the country…" Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"You know you liked it," she teased her best friend.</p>
<p>"You seeing me naked I don't mind," Lilly quipped. "The rest of Tennessee is a bit much." Miley smiled and pulled Lilly into a tight embrace, kissing her gently.</p>
<p>"God I love you…" she whispered.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miley," Lilly whispered back.</p>
<p>"Lilly…" Miley said after a moment. "There's… there's something I need to ask you…"</p>
<p>"What is it?" Lilly asked, suddenly concerned.</p>
<p>"It's nothing bad, I promise," Miley said gently. She swallowed. "I was going to wait, but I think I've changed my mind." Slowly, carefully, she rose to her feet, pulling Lilly to her feet as well. Then she took a half step away, her hand reaching into her pocket.</p>
<p>"I love you Lilly, more than I ever thought it was possible to love anyone… and I never want to stop. From the very first moment we met, you've always been there for me, always supported me… always loved me. You've become a part of me… the other half of my soul… and I don't ever want to let you go." Miley immediately dropped to one knee, bringing her hand out of her pocket. In it was a small red velvet box, and she flipped it open to reveal a sparkling diamond ring.</p>
<p>"Lillian Danielle Truscott, will you marry me?" For several long moments, Lilly just stood there, her eyes wide. Then her eyes began to sparkle with tears, and she leapt forward into Miley's arms.</p>
<p>"<i>Yes!</i> Yes I'll marry you! OH MY GOD!" Miley gently slid the diamond ring onto Lilly's finger and kissed her passionately, a passion returned by the young woman who had just agreed to spend forever with her.</p>
<p>"I love you so much…" Miley breathed.</p>
<p>"Not as much as I love you," Lilly managed through her joyful tears. "I swear, I I'm gonna spend the rest of my life proving it."</p>
<p>"You do that every day," Miley whispered. She leaned forward to kiss Lilly again, only to be interrupted by a polite cough. Miley looked up to see her grandmother Ruby standing nearby, a warm smile on her face.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said softly. "I didn't mean to interrupt." Miley just smiled.</p>
<p>"That's okay, grandma," she responded. "Grandma… Lilly and I are getting married."</p>
<p>"Oh, honey, that's wonderful!" Ruby exclaimed. She hugged them both warmly, "I'm so happy for you both!"</p>
<p>"I know your mother would be too," she added softly. She turned to Lilly. "Welcome to the family, Lilly."</p>
<p>"Thank you…" Lilly started to say.</p>
<p>"Grandma," Ruby said with a smile. "You can call me Grandma now." Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"I'd like that… grandma." They hugged again, and Ruby found herself wiping away a joyful tear of her own.</p>
<p>"Oh! I almost forgot!" she suddenly exclaimed. "Your daddy's on the phone, Miley! He wants to speak to you... he said it was important." Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"Come on Lils, we can tell him the good news!" she said excitedly. Grabbing Lilly's hand, Miley rushed back to her grandmother's house. She found the phone receiver still lying on the kitchen counter and quickly picked it up.</p>
<p>"Hey daddy!" she greeted her father.</p>
<p>"Hey darlin'," Robbie Ray greeted her in return. "How are things with your Grandma Ruby?"</p>
<p>"Things are going great daddy," she said with a grin. "In fact… there's something I want to tell you."</p>
<p>"I need to tell you something too, bud," Robbie Ray replied. "Mr. Lebeck from the record company called again; seems your album's doing really, really well… so well, they want you to go on tour, darlin'."</p>
<p>"T-tour?" Miley stammered, her own news momentarily forgotten.</p>
<p>"Yup," Robbie Ray continued. "A tour… a dozen cities over three months… and they want you to start right away."</p>
