SEVEN</b></p>
<p><i>A sleepy grin spread across Miley's face, and a few moments later she was asleep, her lips pouting as she slept. Lilly grabbed the remote and lowered the volume a few notches, then tossed it on the table in front of her. Her hands settled on Miley's feet, her fingers poking at the bright purple toes attached to the feet that Miley had so casually thrown on her lap. She ran her hand over Miley's ankles as she trained her eyes on the television. Not even twenty minutes later, Lilly started to trail her fingers up along the smooth skin of Miley's shin and she could clearly hear something other than the television in front of her. She swiveled her head to the left as she heard the sound again, the purple-colored toenails dipping as her toes curled. Miley's lips parted and released a throaty groan, her head tilting back only slightly.</i></p>
<p><i>Lilly nearly jumped out of her skin as her name fell from Miley's mouth in rapid succession only a few moments later.</i></p>
<p><i>One question burned brightly as she watched her friend release more breathy sounds: </i><b>What the hell am I supposed to do now?</b></p>
<p><b><hr size=1 noshade></b></p>
<p>Lilly tightened her grip on her friend's leg, simply unable to keep her eyes off of Miley as her name fell from the singer's parted lips in an almost constant string of sighs. She bit her bottom lip hard and squeezed her eyes shut, hanging her head. Of course – <i>of course</i> Miley had to dream about her. Screw the fact that Lilly was <i>right there, </i>literally watching every move she made.</p>
<p>This was <i>so</i> not the time.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Lilly was pressed flush against Miley, their hands and fingers intertwined on either side of the fake blonde's head. She had effectively pinned Miley against the door to her dressing room, taking the sting out of her actions with a soft kiss against Miley's lips. It was an apology, Miley knew, for abruptly yanking her from the couch she'd just laid down on and throwing her against the door. Miley accepted the apology, pulling her lips back only to brush them over Lilly's.</p>
<p>Lilly only smiled against the singer's lips and slipped her jean-clad leg between both of Miley's, applying light pressure to the brunette's heated center.</p>
<p>Miley tilted her head back and instantly felt Lilly's lips on the underside of her jaw, dipping to press light kisses against the long, smooth column of her throat. A throaty laugh escaped Miley at the sensation, and she felt Lilly smile against her neck as her throat and chest vibrated from the sound. Lilly lifted her head from the crook of Miley's neck, her cheek sliding against Miley's as she brushed her lips against Miley's ear.</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I try something?" Lilly questioned. She drew her head back, purposely meeting Miley's eyes. Miley chewed on her bottom lip thoughtfully. "I promise you'll like it." Miley then jerked her head up and down, unable to get the right words out. "<i>Awesome</i>. Good choice, Hannah."</p>
<p>Lilly released Miley's hands with a wink and a soft, reassuring smile. The smile did its job and Miley instantly relaxed. Lilly then helped Miley out of her jacket, tossing the white leather jacket onto the floor next to Miley's feet. Both of Miley's eyebrows shot up into her hairline as Lilly dropped to her knees, working quickly to undo her belt buckle. Once she undid the buckle, Lilly slid the studded belt from Miley's waist and threw it on top of the jacket. The belt properly dealt with, she popped the button on Miley's jeans and pulled the zipper down. Lilly hooked her fingers into the waistline of Miley's jeans and underwear, curling them as she slid the offending materials down her long, tanned legs.</p>
<p>Before Miley realized what was happening, she felt Lilly's tongue on her – hot and wet and touching her most sensitive spot. She leaned heavily against the door, her fingers trying to dig into the door on either side of her. One of Lilly's hands wrapped around one of her wrists and placed her hand on top of her head before doing the same to her other, and Miley groaned in appreciation as she dug her fingers in Lilly's hair. Then Lilly took a hold of one of Miley's legs and hooked it over her shoulder, effectively giving herself more space to work with and keeping Miley's waist pinned to the door.</p>
<p>Miley looked down at Lilly between her legs, stroking her hair to the side to see Lilly's face. Her hips unconsciously bucked against Lilly's face, causing Lilly's nose to bump against her clit. Throwing her head back, Miley could feel herself start to tremble, her orgasm just around the corner. Lilly's tongue slid against her clit, and Miley tightened her grip on the blonde's hair, feeling the pressure just start to trickle inside of her –</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Lilly was able to slide out from under Miley's feet and stood upright, wrapping her arms around herself as she eyed the girl sleeping on the couch. It looked like she was far from sleep with the way her body was jerking, as well as the sounds escaping her mouth, but there was no way Miley would ever act like this if she was awake, and Lilly knew that.</p>
<p>Still. The situation was a little awkward.</p>
<p>Maybe she should just let her sleep. Lilly could slip out easily and be back before Miley even woke up, no problem. And when she came back, if Miley was still… writhing on the couch, then she'd wake her up before her father or brother had the chance to witness Miley… possibly coming… right in front of them.</p>
<p>God, that would so suck for Miley.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lilly could just wake her up. <i>Oh, Miley hasn't been sleeping? So, what?</i> Lilly could just '<i>forget</i>' the fact that Miley hasn't been sleeping and shake her until she wakes up.</p>
<p>Pressing her palm to her forehead, Lilly squeezed her eyes shut and took slow deep breaths, weighing her options. Miley's breathy sighs and moans weren't helping, she decided as she opened her eyes. Her head swiveled once more to her best friend's sleeping form, her jaw dropping and her eyes widening almost comically as she realized that Miley had managed to slip one of her hands beneath the waistline of those tight black jeans she wore.</p>
<p>Lilly made her decision as she saw Miley's hand moving beneath the fabric. Her lips parted as she watched, and for a moment had the desire to just watch the brown-haired beauty in such a vulnerable state. However, it was a fleeting desire and it was out of her head almost as soon as she'd thought of it.</p>
<p>After slapping herself lightly on the cheek to refocus her thoughts, Lilly took a couple of steps forward and stood over Miley. She concentrated only on Miley's face as she lifted her leg onto the couch, tucking it beneath her as she leaned over her best friend. The side of her thigh and calf brushed against Miley's leg as she leaned, which prompted another sound from her.</p>
<p>Lilly looked pointedly at Miley's face as she reached for her wrist, quickly pulling it from her jeans. She set the limb on Miley's stomach. Turning to the side for just a moment, Lilly blushed as she took the bottom of Miley's shirt and lifted it a few inches. With one hand, Lilly held tightly onto Miley's. The other took the bottom of Miley's shirt and wiped off her best friend's very wet fingers. Once that was done, Lilly pulled Miley's shirt back over the few inches of stomach she had exposed. She kept one hand on top of Miley's so there was no chance of that happening again.</p>
<p>A pained look crossed Miley's sleeping features and a tear slipped out from beneath her closed eyelids. Lilly frowned at this, having to keep rebellious Miley's hand against her stomach. Lilly didn't have time to dwell on the tear Miley had shed. Blue-grey eyes were exposed as Miley awoke, her honey-thick Tennessee accent resurfacing but not disguising a very colorful string of words spilling out of her mouth between frantic gasps and deep gulps of air.</p>
<p>"…<i>so fuckin' close</i>…" Lilly caught the tail of what Miley had said, her face heating up considerably.</p>
<p>Miley's words rose in volume as she realized she was awake again. The meaning of her words was painfully clear to Lilly, and if the situation wasn't so ridiculously out there, she would feel somewhat sympathetic for her friend. As it was, the sound of Miley's accent (the one she's always been turned on by, though Miley didn't know that), which Lilly was no stranger to but only heard on rare occasions had snapped Lilly out of the trance she had fallen into. Her hand flew from the one she'd been pinning to Miley's stomach.</p>
<p>"Miley…" Lilly muttered, but then trailed off. What could she say to make the situation any easier? "Miley, just relax. You're awake now. You're fine."</p>
<p>Miley didn't relax. She simply couldn't relax, not with Lilly in such close proximity. Oh, God, the things Miley wanted to do to her. She could feel wetness pooling between her legs, trickling even now that she was on the edge of what she knew would have been a powerful orgasm. But she hadn't had one, even in her dream.</p>
<p>Lilly had been between her legs, her tongue and… teeth… moving against her and inside of her, and she had been so close… close enough to feel the beginning of the mind-numbing sensation that Miley had come to <i>crave</i>. Yet, feeling wouldn't leave her. It was there, right around the corner, almost close enough to… <i>touch</i>? Yes, Miley thought to herself as she became aware of the sweat that had built up while she'd been asleep, she needed to be touched. She couldn't just squash this down. Miley craved release.</p>
<p>Miley's blue-grey eyes instantly locked onto the blue ones of her best friend, just a few inches to her left. Even though – or maybe <i>because </i>– her mind was still fuzzy and the throbbing between her legs threatened to be the death of her (<i>she had been so close, so fucking </i>close) she acted purely on impulse. Miley snaked her left hand around Lilly's neck, her fingers coming to a rest at the base of Lilly's hairline, her left gripping the collar of the blonde's shirt.</p>
<p>Without a second thought, Miley pulled her best friend to her and their lips crashed against each other in a bruising kiss. Lilly's eyes widened and locked onto Miley's. Miley parted her lips and took Lilly's bottom one between both of hers, her top lip trapped between Lilly's. After a few moments, Lilly's panicked look faded and her eyelids fluttered shut. Seeing this, Miley let her own eyes slide shut as well, throwing herself completely into kiss.</p>
<p>"Lilly…" Miley broke the kiss, arching her back as arousal coursed through her body. "I'm sorry, Lilly. I need… you to get off me. Just give me a few minutes. <i>Alone</i>."</p>
<p>Lilly ignored her. She had gotten a taste of Miley and it had been sweeter than she'd imagined it would be. Miley had made the first move – or rather, Lilly considered it the first move in her mind – and now the ball was in her court. She decided she wasn't going to waste time, and her lips once again pressed down heavily on Miley's. As Miley's lips parted from the shock of feeling Lilly's on her once more, Lilly used the opportunity to slide her tongue against her best friend's. A shudder tore through Miley's body, and Lilly responded with a shudder of her own. Lilly pulled her lips from Miley's and dipped her head to become familiar with the taste of Miley's neck.</p>
<p>Miley's hand flew to the blonde girl's hair, holding her in place as she found her pulse point, using her teeth and tongue to stir up wonderful sensations that <i>really</i> didn't help her throbbing center.</p>
<p>"If you won't get off of me, then you're goin' to get <i>me</i> off." Miley growled, accent flaring, giving her an ultimatum that would end up with her finding release whichever way it went. "Unless you want me to get myself off right now, of course. I could do that, too, but it might be a little uncomfortable for you."</p>
<p>Lilly only grunted in response to Miley's near-venomous words, then pulled herself away from Miley completely. Before Miley could even think to get up off the couch, Lilly had grabbed her legs and pushed them up so they bent at the knee. Miley threw her head back as Lilly spread her legs apart and crawled on top of her, Lilly's center pressing right above where she needed the other girl to be.</p>
<p>"Damn it, Lilly–" Miley groaned, frustrated before Lilly's lips on hers cut off whatever else she was going to say. Miley, however, tore her lips from Lilly's and fixed her with a look. She grabbed for one of Lilly's hands and tugged it between them to the buckle of Miley's belt. "Please – please just… touch me. <i>Now.</i>"</p>
<p>"This is <i>so</i> a move," Lilly muttered to herself. A sly smile made its way to her face at the implications of her words. If she hadn't been sure before, she was certain now. She wanted this, and so did Miley.</p>
<p>Lilly was going to get what she wanted.</p>
<p>"Can this count as your birthday present?" Lilly asked with a grin as she moved lower and bent one of her knees, pressing her thigh against Miley's clothed center.</p>
<p>"And every birthday after this for the rest of my life – I don't give a fuck." Miley ground out through clenched teeth, her hips involuntarily moving against Lilly's thigh. She squeezed her eyes shut. "I need you inside of me."</p>
<p>Lilly moved upward once more, brushing her cheek against Miley's. She whispered into the other girl's ear, "This is just me getting you off. Our first time is not going to be in your dressing room,<i>Hannah</i>."</p>
<p>Lilly's words sent a shiver down Miley's spine, turning her on more than they should've been. Then Lilly found herself on her back, the shock of Miley's sudden action sending her into a state of shock. She was frozen at the sight of <i>Hannah Montana</i> straddling the thigh that had just been between her legs and now was again. Miley rocked herself against Lilly's leg a few times, then frowned, tugging her bottom lip between her teeth. Miley then shifted higher and straddled both of Lilly's thighs. Satisfied with her position, she leaned forward and placed her hands on Lilly's stomach, closing her eyes as she began moving against Lilly.</p>
<p>Her breathing hitched at the sensation of Lilly against her, the blonde girl's own hips moving in sync with hers. Below Miley, Lilly fought to stifle the arousal that burned through her veins at the sight of Miley essentially <i>riding</i> her – her blonde wig still perfectly in place. <i>Hannah Montana</i> was on top of her, and that fact alone turned her on immensely. But besides that, it was <i>Miley</i>, her best friend, the girl she had developed a crush on and started to fall for – hard – and the girl who wanted her for so much more than the heights she could bring her to in their most intimate moments.</p>
<p><i>It isn't just physical for her, is it? </i>Lilly frowned as she mulled this over; she dearly hoped that Miley wanted her for more than just <i>this</i> – because she's wanted Miley for a while now.</p>
<p>All of Miley.</p>
<p>After this… she would need to have all of Miley, or not have her at all.</p>
<p>That single thought hurt her heart and made her head spin, so Lilly focused all of her attention back on the girl above her and avoided the heart-wrenching thought of cutting Miley out of her life if things didn't work out.</p>
<p>Determined to avoid all bad thoughts and finish this… whatever this was with Miley before her dad and brother returned, Lilly placed her hands on her best friend's waist and urged her on. Miley groaned at the contact and slid her hands beneath Lilly's shirt. The skin beneath her fingertips was damp with sweat, but it felt so good. Hell, everything about Lilly felt good. Her firm stomach, her soft, slick skin. The way her center ground against Miley's.</p>
<p>Miley tried to hold out. She wanted to drag this out as long as she possibly could. She honestly had no idea why Lilly was let Miley do this, or if she'd ever get the chance to be this close to Lilly again. So she let her thoughts stray to something else – something horrible and gross – to keep herself from getting the most out of her movements. After a minute, though, her resolve weakened and she knew she couldn't wait very much longer. She'd already held off as long as she can, and the faint memories of her dream – now tucked safely away in the back of her mind – flashed in front of her eyes, and she knew she had to let this end soon.</p>
<p>Miley tilted her head back and squeezed her eyes shut, bucking her hips harder against Lilly, releasing a string of sighs and occasionally whispering Lilly's name. It was faint, but Lilly heard it loud and clear. It was one thing to hear it from a sleeping Miley. But hearing her own name spoken from Miley when she was on the edge of what had to be an amazing experience – Lilly wouldn't know – was an entirely different thing.</p>
<p><i>Hmm…</i> Lilly pursed her lips for a moment and glanced at the clock hanging on the wall behind Miley. They had twenty minutes before Robbie Ray and Jackson were supposed to return. Then, she smiled to herself. If Miley had such an effect on her, then what kind of effect would she (and her ability to actually form a sentence) have on Miley?</p>
<p>Internally, Lilly shrugged. Why not give it a try? Unsuccessfully trying to stifle the blush she was sure to stain her face, she spoke in much the same tone Miley had, though her voice rang a little louder, "Come on, Hannah." Miley whimpered. Lilly drew out slowly, "Come for me, Miley Ray."</p>
<p>It was the way Lilly spoke her real name, not Hannah's, that pushed Miley over the edge. Oh, God, there was just something about hearing Lilly draw out <i>Miley Ray</i> in that particular tone that really got to her. Miley squeezed her eyes shut as went completely still on top of Lilly for a moment, her hands balling into white-knuckled fists as she bit both lips to keep from screaming out. Lilly slid her hands to the small of Miley's back as she pulled herself into a sitting position, feeling Miley jerk her hips every few seconds. Miley immediately pulled her hands from beneath Lilly's shirt and reached up to grip her shoulders tightly, burying her face in the crook of her best friend's neck.</p>
<p>"Sweet Jesus…" Miley managed to grunt out as her hips jerked one last time. She trembled violently against Lilly, trying to catch her breath. It seemed almost impossible to draw in enough air, and for a fleeting second, she was scared she'd suffocate. As Miley wrapped her arms around Lilly's neck, holding the blonde tightly against her, Lilly lifted her hands from the small of Miley's back and moved them upward. It felt just like a hug, and that thought helped Miley relax and fill her lungs with sweet, sweet air. "I have lungs of a singer… how is it that you manage to take <i>my</i> breath away?"</p>
<p>"It must be a Lilly-thing." Lilly chuckled.</p>
<p>Miley let out a throaty laugh and pulled away from Lilly's neck. She opened her mouth to say something, but Lilly instantly cut her off by kissing her. It was slow and calm and just what Miley needed to relax completely. "Thank you, Lil." Miley muttered repeatedly against her lips between small kisses. After a minute or two, she whispered, "Why did you do that?" against Lilly's lips. Then she said in a louder voice, "I mean… thank you, Lilly. This has got to be the best birthday present <i>ever</i>, but – <i>why</i>?"</p>
<p>"Do you think I can explain when we get back to your house?" Lilly questioned, "Your dad and brother should be back soon, and this is so not the place to talk about anything as personal as this."</p>
<p>"Considerin' what we just did, that's kind of hard to believe." Miley said and kissed Lilly again, "I need to change, though, an' it might be best if we meet daddy and Jackson out back."</p>
<p>Lilly raised an eyebrow. "Why's that?"</p>
<p>Miley bit her bottom lip as her lips spread into an easy smile, parting to expose the teeth biting down on her lip. Her eyes twinkled as they landed on Lilly's. "I'm pretty sure I soaked through my jeans, an' it wouldn't do good for either of us if they walked in here with the room smellin' like… well, <i>me</i>."</p>
<p>Lilly blushed as Miley moved off of her. "Right. Gotcha."</p>
<p>"Come with me," Miley requested, "It looks like you're gonna need a new pair of pants, too."</p>
<p>"What?" Lilly looked down at her pants and her eyes widened, "You managed to soak through my jeans, too? How the hell did you do <i>that</i>?"</p>
<p>Arousal coursed through Lilly as Miley drawled in that damn <i>accent</i>, "It's a Lilly-thing," and winked.</p>
