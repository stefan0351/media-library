<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 2: Denied Discoveries? -->

<p>Two months later...</p>
<p>Buffy sat together with Willow in their dorm room -Willow had hacked into the computer of the college and made sure that they were both together in a room that was near the entrance so that she could do her slaying job without being too much disturbed- and were studying. Well at least she tried to study. It was the first week on college and so she hadn't too much to do but even that was awful hard with Willow just mere meters away from here in front of her own desk and doing some research in the net. She hadn't been able to concentrate on studying since Willow had entered the room. And she exactly knew why.</p>
<p>'God I love her' Buffy thought. 'Stop, Buffy stop. You can't do this, she's your best friend and you know that she won't answer your feelings for her so stop thinking about that!'</p>
<p>But she couldn't. Not after her dream that night after the "good bye party" for Xander.</p>
<p>She could still remember every single second. She and Willow together in her bed, snuggled into each other's warmth. Then she had noticed that it was Willow next to her in the bed and startled. She had jumped out of the bed -'Ohhh... what a fool have I been to do that.'- and looked into Willows eyes. She saw the love that they held seeming to reflect the love that she had finally accepted only seconds before. And then as she wanted to kiss her. Oh she really had wanted that badly but she woke up before their lips had met and she cursed herself for waiting too long.</p>
<p>But here she was now in the college with her one and only love just at the other side of the room and unable to do anything else than think about the love she felt for Willow.</p>
<p>'Stop, Buffy you have do learn for the semester or you will completely fail and then you will loose her because she will leave and you will have to stay here, so stop thinking about this and LEARN!!' she scold herself.</p>

<p>Willow didn't feel even a little better. She loved Buffy and had accepted that long time ago but she had not allowed herself to tell Buffy about her feelings, fearing that she didn't feel the same and would reject her. She didn't want to loose the friendship they both had and she was sure that it would end if she told Buffy about her feelings. So she just kept quiet and tried to do some research for Giles. She really tried badly but no matter how much she tried to concentrate she failed. Then she had enough and shut the notebook and decided to take a shower. She was always able to calm down and think a little more clearly when she could feel the hot water run over her skin. She undressed, slipped into her bathrobe and fetched her toiletry bag and headed for the showers.</p>
<p>'Well at least it's 3am. There shouldn't be any people in the showers.'</p>
<p>And she was right. She went in turned the water on then slipped out of her robe, turned the lights off -she preferred to shower in the dark since she was once caught masturbating in the shower and she felt safer when the lights were off, it gave her some time to recover before somebody noticed her- and then slipped under the hot water, letting it cover her skin and pour down her body. It really helped her and she could feel the worries and the sorrows fall off of her. And she used that relief to think what she would do. She thought about her feelings -like so often since that dream that had let her accept her love for Buffy- and about what she should do about them.</p>
<p>After the shower she hadn't came any closer to an answer than she was over two months ago. But at least she was able to calm down and was full of energy again. She dried herself off and headed back to her room. There she found Buffy lying on her bed her eyes staring onto the ceiling.</p>
<p>"A penny for your thoughts." Willow offered with a smile.</p>
<p>"Hmmm..? Oh sorry. Just thinking about... wait the penny first." Buffy said sitting up with a grin on her features, which Willow thought, was absolutely charming.</p>
<p>"Buffy!" Willow said playfully.</p>
<p>"Ok, ok, sorry..." her grin slowly fading to a shy smile "... I was just thinking about if it is possible to find the one true love. You know that one that is there when you need someone to listen and cheers you up when you are sad. The one you can tell everything and trust without a thought."</p>
<p>Willow's mood was slowly becoming worse. 'Angel, that must be why she was so distracted over the summer. And you thought it was because of you. Never be so selfish Willow it only hurts you more'</p>
<p>"I think that it is possible to find the true love, but that many just don't look for it or want to wait until it comes to them not knowing that love never comes, it has to be found."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was just wondering if I'll ever be able to find and to live with my true love."</p>
<p>"You will find it because you are looking for it, I can see it in your eyes."</p>
<p>"Yeah you're probably right but I don't want to find the one for me when it is too late, I couldn't hurt that person. You know if I find the one and tell him how much I feel and then die the very next day while slaying."</p>
<p>"You will find the true love, hey any maybe she's even already here and then you don't even have to look for long just peek around the corner and maybe he's there." Willow said cursing herself for that not necessary mistake she made as she mentioned that her lover could be a woman.</p>
<p>"You're absolutely right Will, why think about it and not just go and look for it. Thank you Willow, you have..." Buffy said trailing off. 'What did she say? She mentioned that my true love could already be here, that I just had to look and see her. She said that my true love could be a woman. But she can't know it's impossible. I never told her or anyone else how I feel. Except if...' Buffy was unable to finish that thought. 'No that's not possible she can't love me, it's impossible. I must just have not listened correctly that's all. Yes I haven't listened and thought that she said something I wanted to hear, that's it. Yes it must have been my imagination.'</p>
<p>"Buffy?"</p>
<p>"...really helped me with this." Buffy finished the sentence.</p>
<p>"That's what I'm here for, now sleep and tomorrow you'll go out and find her."</p>
<p>'DAMN, what's wrong with me, Willow you have to be more careful about what you say'</p>
<p>'There!! There it was again! She said <find her>. That can't be a coincidence. No she must know something I don't know. I'll have to keep an eye on her' Buffy thought slightly frowning.</p>
<p>"Buffy is everything ok?"</p>
<p>"Yes sure everything ok." Buffy said falling back onto the bed and staring onto the ceiling. 'I really have to keep an eye on her.'</p>
<p>'Damn, she must have suspected something. Stupid Willow, why did you have to let that slip out? I really hope that she doesn't find out about my feelings. I couldn't live any longer if I loose our friendship by not controlling myself enough.'</p>

<p>Buffy had watched Willow now over a week, trying to find out what she meant as she said that she had to go out and find a woman as true love. And with the help of her slayer senses she had noticed some changes Willow had made since she had last observed her. She noticed how distracted Willow was when Buffy was near her. She saw something in her eyes that she couldn't recognize. She even noticed that Willow sometimes seem to avoid her, especially after more or less private discussions between them or after longer research periods. Actually every time when she and Willow were seeming to get a little closer. But Buffy still couldn't say why Willow did that but the suspect that it was because of Buffy herself became more and more present in her mind. And Buffy wasn't really sure if that was a good or a bad thing. She hoped -God she really, really hoped- that it was a good thing. She didn't want to, she never wanted to loose her friendship with Willow. Not even at cost of being able to tell her her feelings and then spending a hot night together. She didn't want to loose that friendship that she had built up in over three years of being together. Never.</p>
<p>Willow on the other side had noticed -even without any slayer senses-, that Buffy's behavior had changed since their talk about the true love. She had tried not to act other than normal but Willow could still see that Buffy was kind of watching her. She on the other hand tried to act the same as before, tried even harder not to let any words slip out that could reveal her true feelings, especially after she had noticed that change in Buffy's eyes, in her whole body language.</p>
<p>'God why do you let me go through this? What have I done to deserve the loss of our friendship? Please tell me so that I can correct it and avoid loosing Buffy's affection, her friendship.'</p>
<p>This really was a hard time for both and they had to go through it together to manage it.</p>
