<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Nineteen -->

<p>Lacy's original plan to avoid sleeping in the same bed with Gage was derailed. After her agent dumped the disturbing news on her, she sought a distance between them in order to think without having the intoxicating pull between them claim her. Yet, early morning brought a sleepy Lacy waking in the safe and comforting arms of the writer as they both lay on the couch. When Lacy shifted slightly so she could see the blond better, Gage's green eyes slowly lifted.</p>
		<p>"Guess my reluctance to share your bed last night was for nothing since we ended up sleeping together anyway." She found humor in her failed plan.
			<i>Of course, my heart wasn't really in that decision.</i>
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>In the distance, Gage heard a hammer banging. The noise came from the general direction of the cabin Lacy had rented. Her attention returned to Derek and Dani playing along the shoreline. She allowed nagging thoughts to wash over her regarding her feelings about Lacy and the call the star received from her agent last night, interrupted only by the insistent noise Dani made with her whistle. It seemed that every time Dani discovered a rock that was worthy of her collection, she would blow the whistle proclaiming it to the world</p>
		<p>Watching Dani peruse several rocks, Gage sighed heavily.
			<i>That was a close call this morning. </i>While Lacy fixed breakfast, the kids and Gage waited patiently at the table. When the toast popped up out of the toaster, seeing Lacy with her hands full, Gage jumped up. "I'll get it."
		</p>
		<p>Absent mindedly, Lacy replied. "Thank you, sweetheart." Then sent the writer a dazzling smile, provoking Gage to return one in kind. </p>
		<p>For one brief moment neither woman noticed both of Dani's eyebrows jerk up taking refuge under her dark bangs at her mother's words. Shifting her curious blue eyes from mother to Gage then back to Lacy, Dani waited for an explanation that never came. Instead, Lacy's words stumbled forth. "I mean, we can.. eat short...ly...... anytime now.
			<i>Great, she'll really believe I meant to say eat short...ly instead of sweetheart. </i>It was clear to everyone except Derek that Dani was unconvinced. Except for Dani's request for a cough drop for her sore throat, breakfast was a quiet affair.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy used the quiet morning to read the writer's screenplay. Gage insisted that as Lacy read the story, she and the kids would spend some quality time together outside. As she read the story, Lacy only allowed one thought to distract her. It was of Gage. Determined, she vowed, she could not and would not give up this woman who had become such an important part of her life.
			<i>No, she has become my life.</i> The only obstacles that would fall in the way of her declaration where Gage was concerned came in the form of two pairs of eyes. One set gray like his father and the other set matched her own.
			<i>My children. </i>What happened that morning at breakfast did not stray far from her mind.
		</p>
		<p>When the sound of hammering stopped, Gage noticed Dani slipping further up the shoreline toward Cabin C. The writer shot a quick glance to find Derek only a few feet behind her and took hold of his tiny hand. He insisted on walking along side her. All morning Dani kept a distance from the writer lost in her own thoughts about what transpired between her mother and Gage.</p>
		<p>The writer was concerned, but felt helpless to do anything. When Gage and Derek reached the knoll between the two cabins, the writer caught sight of Dani playing at the water's edge. She observed Dani twist around slowly, staring back to shore. Gage tracked the direction in which the young girl was keenly glaring only to find an older man intently watching Dani.</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Gage yelled. "Come here."</p>
		<p>It didn't take long for dark haired girl to obey the command.</p>
		<p>"Dani, you stay here with Derek." She directed, keeping a close eye on the stranger who turned to walk away. "Mister, wait up." Gage shouted. Rushing up behind the man, Gage grabbed at his arm jerking him around. "Hey, I asked you to wait." Easily recognizing him now. "Ralph, was that you I heard hammering?"</p>
		<p>"What's it to ya?" His irascible nature raised its hideous head.</p>
		<p>"Just wondering." Gage said, narrowing her green eyes. "You seemed to be taking quite an interest in the young girl. First at the fair and again now... I saw you watching her pretty closely."</p>
		<p>"You're nuts. I weren't watching nobody. And what would the likes of you do about if I were?" Ralph taunted. </p>
		<p>The writer stepped closer. "If I catch you anywhere near either child or Mrs. Levine, for that matter, you'll wish you'd never came into contact with the likes of me." She hissed, venom dripping.</p>
		<p>Sharply making an about face, Gage joined the children, taking each of them by the hand. No one looked back to see Ralph let out a nasty snicker as a twisted evil smirk rose up on his weathered face.</p>
		<p>Taking a break from reading the screenplay, Lacy watched the trio head back to the cabin. "Where you been?"</p>
		<p>Dani ran ahead. "Collecting rocks." She rushed past her mother and into the cabin. "I've gotta wash these."</p>
		<p>As Gage and Derek reached the steps, Lacy lifted her son. "You look tired." Then gazed at the writer.</p>
		<p>"It's been a full morning. Finished the story?" Gage asked, stepping past the star on the porch.</p>
		<p>"No. Thought I'd come outside for a while. Get some sun while I read." </p>
		<p>"And we we're just heading in." Gage smiled. "Are you sure you don't want to join us?"</p>
		<p>Lacy handed her son to Gage. "Tempting, but I better stick to my original plan if I want to finish this screenplay. You guys would be too much of a distraction."</p>
		<p>"Go on then." Noticing Dani was nowhere near. "She's been a little distant. Not saying much at all. Oh, and Ralph's up near the other cabin. Caught him watching Dani."</p>
		<p>"What happened?" A frantic edge clipped her voice. </p>
		<p>"I talked to him." Gage stroked the star's arm in silent comfort. "I don't think he's gonna hang around anymore. But stay close. Okay?"</p>
		<p>"I will." Lacy smiled. "If Dani comes back out, tell her I'll be on the dock."</p>
		<p>Nodding, Gage longed to give Lacy a quick kiss, but crushed that desire effectively before she walked into the cabin with Derek. "Dani, where are you?"</p>
		<p>"In here. Drying my rocks." Dani called from the bathroom. </p>
		<p>"You're mom's down by the dock reading if you go back out, check with her, okay?" Gage instructed.</p>
		<p>"Right." Dani jiggled the pile of rocks, wrapped in the towel, dry. She tossed them on her bed and began sorting them by size.
			<i>These are pretty, but I saw some real nice ones in that cave. Oh yes, the cave. </i> That thought was like a siren calling her, begging her, cajoling her to come. It was in a trance like state that Dani followed the call, formulating a plan as she went.
		</p>
		<p>Hastily gathering her rocks in one of the drawers near her bed, Dani made a mental list of the things she'd need. Walking out to the living room, Dani noted Gage in the kitchen with Derek, getting some water. "I'm heading outside." Her whistle securely wrapped around her neck. </p>
		<p>Gage didn't notice the young girl had changed into a pair of jeans instead of the shorts she wore earlier. "Okay. You're mom's at the dock." The writer's attention was glued on the three year old about to tip his glass too high. </p>
		<p>The sneaky eight-year-old slipped out the cabin door. Seeing her mother in one of the loungers on the dock reading, Dani slipped inside the boathouse, retrieving a flashlight. She paused momentarily to stare at the rope, but decided against taking it. With a quick peek around the corner to her self-absorbed mother, Dani tipped toed slowly over the wood dock onto the grass. She crept up behind the tree line then took a path less traveled in the direction of the cave. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>An hour later Lacy walked back into the cabin having finished the screenplay. Immediately she noticed asleep on the couch were two of her favorite people. Derek, perched on top of Gage, slept peacefully. Gage with one arm wrapped over the young boy was in her own tranquil slumber.</p>
		<p>Lacy sat next to them on the coffee table, reaching out, she fussed with her son's dark locks before running the back of her fingers against Gage's soft cheek. The star's touch caused the writer to smile in her sleep. </p>
		<p>Gage leaned into the delicate and welcoming contact. She shifted slightly, stretching her legs before sluggish eyes finally lifted slightly, seeing the beautiful woman she loved before her. "Hi."
			<i>I want to wake up like this forever.</i> Gage wetted her lips finding strays bits of dark hair from Derek who had nestled tightly up against her. Spitting the stray locks out caused Derek to stir.
		</p>
		<p>"Hello sleepy head." Gray eyes brighten upon seeing his mother.</p>
		<p>"Momma." He wiggled against his human pillow.</p>
		<p>"Hi, honey. Come here." Derek vaulted into her arms, kissing her soundly then giggled. "Where's Dani?" Lacy asked, bouncing her son on her knee.</p>
		<p>Rubbing her eyes, Gage stretched, replying off handedly. "She went outside earlier."</p>
		<p>"I didn't see her." Lacy said, concern washing over her face. "She's not in here?"</p>
		<p>Gage bolted off the couch, dashing into every room in the cabin, searching for the young girl. "She's not in here."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" The frightened mother screamed, running out the cabin door with son in hand. "Dani!" Over and over again, Lacy called for her daughter, silence the only answer. Dani was nowhere in sight no matter in what direction the mother looked. Turning to Gage, frantic and near the edge, Lacy sucked in a deep breath. "The cave."</p>
		<p>"Maybe...." She hesitated at the possible scenario, but had to vocalize it. "The handyman, Ralph."</p>
		<p>Shaking her head vehemently. "No, it's the cave. When she came out earlier, she would have stopped to talk with me unless she had something up her sleeve. She had her whistle, didn't she?"</p>
		<p>"I think so. I haven't seen her without it since Derek found it." Gage replied.</p>
		<p>Deep in the recess of a mother's instincts she knew her child held an unnatural obsession for that cave.
			<i>Like mother, like daughter. </i>"We have to go." Lacy darted off.
		</p>
		<p>"Wait." Gage stopped her then ran to the boathouse retrieving the other flashlight and some rope. Gage flipped the light on, showing a bright beam. </p>
		<p>Swallowing hard, Lacy whispered softly. "She's got the one with the battery that's about dead."</p>
		<p>"Let's go." Gage made a short detour to the cabin, grabbing her cell phone. Then the three traveled the path along the shoreline leading directly to the cave.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Not more than a hundred yards away from the cave they heard an engine roar in the distance, tires spinning. Catching the tail end of a beat up old truck, Lacy gasped. "That's the handyman's truck. I noticed it outside the cabin the day the deputy and I was there and Ralph showed up to fix the window in the door." </p>
		<p>Flipping her cell phone on, Gage punched in several numbers. "I'd like to talk with Sheriff Baylor." She waited. "Sheriff, Mrs. Levine's little girl is missing. We think she went to the cave just north of my cabin." A pause. "Yeah, that's the one. But, we just saw Ralph heading down the old Reynolds road. He was high tailing it out of here pretty fast and, well, earlier today he was....hanging around, watching us. I don't know if it's anything..." The sheriff cut her off causing her to listen closely. "Thanks. We're going to search the cave. Lacy...." The concerned mother shot her a look. "One of us will be at the entrance when you get here."</p>
		<p>When they entered the mouth of the cave Gage determined to have Lacy wait with Derek while she searched it looking for the missing girl. "Lacy, I know..."</p>
		<p>"I know what you're going to say, but I know this cave....I was lost in it once." Tears spilled forth. "I know what she's going through."</p>
		<p>"Hold on." Gage took Lacy by both arms, steadying her. "We don't know if her flashlight went dead yet. Let's not get ahead of ourselves." Gage didn't even want to explore the idea that Ralph had taken the girl and was less reluctant to bring it up, but she had too. "The sheriff said he's gonna have one of his deputies pick up Ralph, just in case." Gage could not dismiss the horror that flooded the blue eyes in front of her when she spoke those words. "I don't think that's the case though." The writer said hurriedly in an attempt to calm the emotional woman fraught with fear. </p>
		<p>In an amazing show of self-control and one look at her son who was getting very upset, Lacy calmed the storm raging inside. "I'll stay here then." She pulled her son close, soothing him. "Wait for the sheriff."</p>
		<p>Gage handed her the cell phone, jacked the rope up over her shoulder and flipped the flashlight on. "She'll be alright, I promise." Stepping away then turning back swiftly, Gage embraced Lacy and child, savoring the moment. Before leaving, Gage shut her eyes and brushed her lips against Lacy's cheek.
			<i>I swear I will do everything I can to get her back safely. </i>With that thought, Gage rushed off into the darkness lit only by a stream of light, barely hearing Lacy's parting words.
		</p>
		<p>Dani delved deep into the smaller tunnel, easily negotiating around the rocks and curves of the walls.
			<i>This one is so much more interesting than the bigger one. And I'm sure that old handyman didn't see me. </i>Upon approaching the cave, Dani witnessed Ralph exit it hurriedly, get in his truck and leave. She waited until the vehicle was out of sight then entered the cave on her great adventures.
		</p>
		<p>She traveled down the cavern path for a quarter mile before she sighted the large chamber opening. The pool glittered against the beam of her flashlight. "Wow. This is great." Blue eyes grew in excitement at the sight of the small waterfall, gushing from overhead into the pool.</p>
		<p>Dani didn't notice the illumination from her flashlight grow weaker. Her exhilaration over her discovery was enthralling, ridding her of any common sense as time stood still in this awe-inspiring world, which now belonged to her. "Yes!" She cocked her arm then noticed several objects near a small table like rock. </p>
		<p>The young explorer flashed her light taking in her latest find. To her surprise, Dani saw a poster of her mother dressed as the cop, Samantha Gordon, from her show. She also found several of her mother's things. Holding up a pair of red panties, Dani knew they matched the bra her mother wore sometimes. Darting the light around, searching for more items, the beam flickered over a small area where something shiny flashed out. Zeroing in on it, Dani found her mother's broach. She grabbed it quickly, stuffing it in her pocket.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I am good. I can't wait till mom sees this." Pride beaming from her voice. But the thought of her mother brought her out of her revelry and into darkness as the flashlight died. As pitch dark surrounded her, Dani let the notion that ?
			<i>maybe this wasn't such a good idea' </i>cross her mind.
		</p>
		<p>Resolved to get herself out of this predicament just like Mecca did in Gage's story of the Shanglon Master, Dani took stock of her bearing trying to remember where she was standing in conjunction to the where she had entered this part of the cave. Feeling her way along the rock wall, Dani inched forward, calmly reassuring herself.
			<i>I will get out of this. I will get out of this. I am not one of those helpless females. </i>Reluctantly admitting,
			<i>but I could use a little help. </i>Teeth chattering tickled her scratchy sore throat. The jeans kept her legs warm, but her short sleeve shirt did little to protect her against the chill she now felt. The coolness of the cavern went unnoticed when her mind was riveted on exploring the cave. But now, the chillness pierced clear to the bone.
		</p>
		<p>Gage Ballant turned left at the fork in the cave following Lacy's advice. "She's sure to take the small tunnel." Echoed in the writer's head before she let out an ear-piercing echo herself. "Dani!" </p>
		<p>When Dani heard the distant voice barely greet her as a whisper, it startled her causing her to lose her footing, sliding on the slippery rock floor. The dark haired girl scooted back swiftly wondering if Ralph had come back to the cave then catching the steep slope's edge, falling into an unknown abyss. Dani spiraled down the small opening, dropping steadily until she came to rest in a small pool of icy water, tucked neatly in the small cove. Her fingers gripped the mossy rocks above her. Unable to get a decent hold, Dani was trapped.</p>
		<p>The light flickered back and forth across the theater like chamber, searching every nook and cranny, Gage yelled again. "Dani!"</p>
		<p>The freezing cold threatened to over come the young girl, teeth rattling, fingers becoming numb and Dani couldn't even feel her toes. Though now she did recognize Gage's voice shouting for her. A weak attempt to call out died on her lips. The small waterfall in the cavern drowned Dani's calls for help, already weakened from her sore throat.</p>
		<p>Frustrated, Gage yelled again and again, searching for an opening that led further into the cave. The writer followed the beam of light from the flashlight as it traveled over the poster attached to the cave wall with the dark haired woman crouched down pointing a gun at some unseen assailant. In effect, she had discovered inside the chamber a shrine to Lacy Levine. Stepping closer, Gage heeded the welcome shriek of a whistle, blowing persistently at her. "Dani." Gage gravitated to the shrill sound.</p>
		<p>Dani blew harder and harder with all her might, hearing the familiar voice of the writer grow louder. Finally, she halted her summons when it was clear Gage was at the top of the small hole she'd fell into. </p>
		<p>"Dani? Are you okay?"</p>
		<p>Through chattering teeth, Gage heard. "Yessss."</p>
		<p>"How far down there, are you?"</p>
		<p>"I don't knowwwwwww."</p>
		<p>"Okay, listen up. Dani, I've got some rope. I'm gonna lower it down." Gage inched closer over the steep slope, sliding over the mossy rock. Shooting both arms out to her sides, Gage stopped her descent. Breathing heavily, Gage tried to get a secure footing to no avail. One false move and the would be rescuer would need rescuing herself. She grabbed the rope coiled over her shoulder with her teeth, prying it loose which allowed it to slip down her arm. "Dani, do you remember how to tie the bowline knot? You remember, don't you?"</p>
		<p>A pause. "Yessss." Shivering against the cold, she spit out slowly.</p>
		<p>"Good. Now, here it comes." Gage carefully worked the rope over her fingers attached to the rock wall, securing her position then lowered the rope about fifteen feet before it stopped its progression. "Got it?"</p>
		<p>Dani tugged on it.</p>
		<p>"Now, tie it around your waist and I'll pull you up."</p>
		<p>Frozen fingers tried to manipulate the stiff rope. "I...I can't."</p>
		<p>"Yes, you can. Dani, listen, you can do it. I know you can. Come on just tie the rope around you. Okay?" The rescuer asked weakly, allowing the hand of fear grip at her.</p>
		<p>In complete darkness, Dani, against great resistance from the rigid rope, guided it into the knot Gage had shown her. Yanking on it as much as her strength allowed, Dani gave Gage the go ahead. "I got it." </p>
		<p>Gage finally secured a precarious foothold, freeing her hands. Dragging Dani up the small, dark cavity, Gage encouraged Dani to talk. She was well aware of the chill that must be swallowing up the young girl. "I'm fine really.....just cold." Dani helped herself along using her legs, pushing herself upward.</p>
		<p>When Dani reached Gage's unstable position, she directed the young girl to crawl over her. "Climb up me."</p>
		<p>Slow, but methodically, Dani inched up the human wall over her to the top of the slope and with one final push landed safely on top. Finally reaching the top herself, Gage pulled the freezing girl in her strong arms, holding on for dear life. The writer kissed her forehead oblivious to Dani's wet clothes now soaking her own. "Come on. We've got to get you out of here."</p>
		<p>When Gage and Dani emerged into the light, Lacy engulfed her daughters in her arms. "Honey, are you okay?" Lacy's took a moment to let her worried eyes roam over her daughter.</p>
		<p>"Derek, come here." Gage swept up her young charge when she saw the Sheriff approach. "Sheriff."</p>
		<p>Nodding, he tipped his hat. "I see ya found her. We've got Ralph at the station for questioning. He's mad as hell...." Eyeing the kids. "Excuse me."</p>
		<p>"Sheriff." Lacy cut him off sharply. "Can you take us to the hospital? She's too cold." The ice-cold skin she felt alarmed her.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>As the doctor checked out Dani, Gage related what she had found in the cave to the sheriff. He left assuring her that he would get to bottom of it. </p>
		<p>A couple of hours later found Dani dry and completely warmed. The doctor gave her approval to release the patient with strict instruction. The sheriff reappeared just in time to give Gage, Lacy and her kids a ride back to the cabin. He took the time to reveal the results of his investigation after Dani filled in a few blanks.</p>
		<p>"I'm glad you found the broach. You can still press charges if you like." Sheriff Baylor informed her.</p>
		<p>Gazing at her recovering daughter, Lacy shook her head. "No. I'd rather have nothing more to do with them."</p>
		<p>"I hear ya." Baylor agreed. "Anyways, apparently Ralph has been following Ned and his friend, Buddy. That was their secret hiding place in the cave. Sally's been worried about Ned, thinking he was doing drugs, drinking. You know, what most teenagers get into. Had Ralph checking on them. He admitted to following them to the cave, waited for them to leave then followed them again."</p>
		<p>"I saw him when I got to the cave." Dani offered.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, apparently, at least, he claims he never knew you were there."</p>
		<p>"He was spying on my children earlier in the day, sheriff." Lacy stretched the facts a little.</p>
		<p>"Yep, he admitted to being out there, but says he was just making sure Ned wasn't following you like some ?love sick puppy dog'. No offense, ma'am, but he don't like you much. Ralph that is." The sheriff said, scooting his hat up to scratch his thinning dark head. "I'll go back to the cave and collect your things and any evidence in case you change your mind."</p>
		<p>"I won't." She said adamantly. "And I don't want any of it. Keep it, throw it away. I don't care."</p>
		<p>The sheriff stopped the car near the cabin. "Here we are." Twisting in his seat to Lacy and her children in the backseat, he assured them. "They won't be bothering ya no more."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Gage and Derek sat out on the porch of the cabin allowing Lacy some time with her daughter. "Hey, kiddo. Come here." </p>
		<p>Derek kept trying to climb up on the rail. "I Debin." He declared to Gage. A little more rambunctious than usual, the small child pulled himself up the rail, reaching out with his short little leg for the swing. </p>
		<p>The writer grabbed for him as he slipped from the rail causing them both to land on the swing. The swing twisted and turned wildly under the unexpected load, releasing an unseen wasp's nest.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Gage." Lacy opened the screen door. "Dani would like to talk to you before she goes to sleep."</p>
		<p>"Oh? Okay." Sitting Derek down, Gage walked past the actress. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy watched Gage make her way across the living room losing sight of her as she turned the hallway corner. Long moments passed as Lacy allowed a welcome relief flood over her knowing the horrible day's events had come to a happy conclusion.</p>
		<p>Gage entered the bedroom, knocking from the door. "Hey, you wanted to see me?"</p>
		<p>"Come on in." A happy, but very tired explorer beckoned.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Gage eased down on the side of the twin bed.</p>
		<p>Dani slipped her small hand over the writer's clasped hands resting on her lap. "You saved me." She stated simply.</p>
		<p>"I may have helped a little. Blowing that whistle was a good idea. And you're the one that tied the rope around you."</p>
		<p>Dani brightened a bit in her sleepy state. "I did, didn't I?" Mulling it over thoughtfully, she continued. "Guess I'm not one of those helpless females."</p>
		<p>"No. No, you certainly are not." Gage confirmed.</p>
		<p>Still standing in the cabin's doorway that feeling of contentment Lacy reveled in sunk rapidly upon seeing her son fall to the porch floor with a yelp, desperately gasping for a breath. "Derek!" Lacy screamed. Derek continued to wheeze and his mother noticed his arm swelling around a red spot.</p>
		<p>Scrambling out onto the porch, Gage stopped short at the sight of Lacy holding her lifeless son. "What's wrong?" </p>
		<p>"I don't know. He just dropped down and....he's having a hard time breathing." The mother loosened his clothes all the while kissing his face checking for fever and offering comfort.</p>
		<p>Scanning the area quickly, Gage honed in on the source of the problem. Wrapped in a sheet Dani hurried through the door as Gage ran back inside, pushing Dani in along with her, heading to the medicine cabinet. </p>
		<p>"Gage!" Lacy yelled.</p>
		<p>Running back outside, Gage stooped down next to mother and child extracting a long tube from its cartoon.</p>
		<p>"What are you doing?" The frightened mother asked.</p>
		<p>"Look up there." Gage nodded toward the porch ceiling. "Dani, get inside now." She yelled at the young girl who peeked back outside, taking a wary step through the door.</p>
		<p>Gage popped the cap off then jabbed the syringe into the small boy's thigh. "There. He'll be okay now." She assured the mother. "But we need to take him to the hospital so they can check him out."</p>
		<p>"Hospital? But..." The mention of hospital did nothing to relieve her fears.</p>
		<p>"Just a precaution and we'll need to get another prescription. Apparently, this little guy is allergic to wasps." Scooping him up, pulling Lacy along up along with them, Gage led mother and child to the safety of the cabin. "Lacy, listen, Derek will be fine. Trust me. My friend, Mark, is allergic to wasps too. He keeps a spare dose of EpiPen here at the cabin." </p>
		<p>Warmed by the trusting green eyes before her, Lacy nodded. "Dani, go get your clothes and bring them out here." Lacy held on tightly to her son who seemed to be making a slow recovery.</p>
		<p>Gage scoured through one of the cabinets in the kitchen. Having found what she was searching for, headed out the screen door. "I'll be right back. That's the last time you little buggers have your way with my family." With diligent determination, Gage exterminated every last one of the wasps before she reentered the cabin, victorious. Any celebration would have to wait. Derek needed tending too.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>As night fell and two trips to the hospital later, Gage found herself surrounded by the people she loved the most in the world. Dani lay next to her mother while Derek staked out a place between her and Gage. All happy and content, sleep claimed them. </p>
