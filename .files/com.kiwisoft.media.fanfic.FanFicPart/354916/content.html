<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Going Shopping -->

<p>Rheta is lugging all the materials Gabrielle asked her to get for Xena into a huge heap (which will never be used) when Farris comes running up the road into Kalmia.</p>
		<p>"Gabrielle is here," says Rheta, going joyfully to greet him. "She's fantastic!"</p>
		<p>As she speaks, Gabrielle emerges from the bathing hut, looking radiant after her bath. She is brushing her long blonde hair with one hand and twirling her bath cap with the other.</p>
		<p>"So talented, and kind, and -"</p>
		<p>"Beautiful," completes Farris who is gazing at Gabrielle like someone who's just been hit between the eyes. </p>
		<p>Rheta's joy disappears abruptly as she realizes the way her boyfriend is looking at Gabrielle. "Well, she's all right... If you like that type."</p>
		<p>Xena comes out of the hut behind Gabrielle, spies Farris and goes up to him. "Any problems delivering the message to Griffith?" </p>
		<p>He comes to with a start. "Erm, no. I wrapped it round a stone and lobbed it into his cave."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle and Rheta are listening interestedly. </p>
		<p>"What happened next?" asks Xena.</p>
		<p>Farris frowns in thought. "Well, it was silent for a bit, then there was this huge roar ... then he came running out, still pulling his pants up."</p>
		<p>Xena smiles in satisfaction. "Must have been in a hurry, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Must have."</p>
		<p>"What direction was he headed last time you looked?"</p>
		<p>"Aucuba."</p>
		<p>Xena rubs her hands together with great relish. </p>
		<p>"So Loxius is taken care of?" asks Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Xena nods. "Which means I can concentrate on the giant."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle perks up. "You've decided?" she asks eagerly.</p>
		<p>"Patience, Gabrielle. I'm getting there." Xena turned back to Farris. "I need some stinging insects. Bees, wasps, hornets ... something like that. Are there any nests near here?" Gabrielle's eyebrows shoot up. </p>
		<p>He nods, bewildered. "Iason's bees swarmed last week and made themselves a new nest close by in the woods. He was going to go and get them back when the giant appeared and we had to evacuate instead."</p>
		<p>"Can you find their exact location for me?"</p>
		<p>He nods doubtfully. "Sure."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle pipes up, "I'm sure Xena has a good reason for asking you to do this, Farris." She turns to Xena. "You do, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Xena nods.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle's intervention has made all the difference to Farris's enthusiasm. "All righty. Location of one nest of stinging things coming up." </p>
		<p>Rheta looks on in disbelief as he runs past her without acknowledgment. "O fickle man, to so ignore Gabrielle's number one fan!"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle exchanges a concerned look with Xena. </p>
		<p>"When Farris gets back," Xena murmurs, "you had better have that chat."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle nods, then turns to Rheta. "You sew quite a bit, don't you, Rheta?" She indicates the bath cap. </p>
		<p>Rheta looks grumpily at her. "Yeah. What of it?" </p>
		<p>Gabrielle makes allowances for Rheta's mood. "I was wondering if you might be willing to make me a nighty."</p>
		<p>Rheta looks reluctant.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle says persuasively, "Do you want to trade? I have just the thing ..."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Xena peeks into the barn, where Gabrielle is writing on a scroll. She comes in and sits next to the bard. Gabrielle apparently takes no notice of her presence, then grabs her staff, which is leaning against a wall nearby, and tries to whack Xena with it. </p>
		<p>Xena is too quick for her. Grumbling a little, Gabrielle replaces the staff and returns to her scroll. </p>
		<p>Xena says: "Solari?"</p>
		<p>"No." Gabrielle scribes a few more words and then sucks the quill.</p>
		<p>Xena, standing and pacing a little: "Was it someone you knew before I met you?" </p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>Xena, pacing, then throwing up her arms and coming to a halt: "I give up. Who is it?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle looks up and smirks: "Velaska."</p>
		<p>Xena gapes at her. "But she's dead!"</p>
		<p>"No she isn't, Xena - you can't kill a goddess - she's encased in lava, which isn't quite the same thing."</p>
		<p>Xena ruefully acknowledges the point. "Baked Velaska."</p>
		<p>"Well, more like half-baked," says Gabrielle. "She was insane, after all."</p>
		<p>"Ha ha!"</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Xena goes outside and comes to an abrupt halt, making Gabrielle, who is following, cannon into her.</p>
		<p>"Oof! Why did you -" Gabrielle stops as she realizes what Xena is staring at. Rheta is now wearing a straw hat, tied to her head by means of a scarf threaded through two odd holes in it. She looks very smug.</p>
		<p>"Hey!" says Xena to Rheta. "What are you doing with that hat? It isn't yours."</p>
		<p>Rheta's looks annoyed. "Yes it is. I traded for it fair and square. I'm sewing Gabrielle a nighty in return." </p>
		<p>Xena turns an angry look on Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>"Look," says Gabrielle defensively. "I need a nighty. When I stay at my parents' house overnight, I can't sleep in the nude. They think I've picked up enough bad habits from you as it is."</p>
		<p>"That wasn't yours to trade, Gabrielle. It was Argo's."</p>
		<p>"But she never wears it. Besides, it suits Rheta much better."</p>
		<p>"That's not the point." Xena is deadly serious. "<i>I</i> ruined your nighty, but you've taken it out on Argo."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle opens her mouth to speak, then closes it again.</p>
		<p>Xena turns to Rheta (who fortunately has no idea the hat she is so proud of was made for a horse) and says brusquely, "I want it back."</p>
		<p>Rheta is indignant. "Well you can't have it. I traded for it in all honesty ... and besides, the nighty is nearly finished." </p>
		<p>Rheta addresses Gabrielle. "You seem to be a bit hazy about what is yours. This hat's mine. The nighty's yours. Farris is <i>mine</i>." She glances pointedly at Xena. "<i>She's</i> yours." </p>
		<p>Xena is gritting her teeth and purposely not looking at Gabrielle. "I'm going to check on the giant." </p>
		<p>She walks to where Argo is tethered, pats her, and murmurs in her ear: "I'll get you another one, I promise." Argo whinnies gratefully.</p>
		<p>Xena mounts up and heads out of town. </p>
