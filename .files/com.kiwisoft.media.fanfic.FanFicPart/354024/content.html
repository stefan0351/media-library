<!-- Starlight \ Part 10 -->

<p>&#34;You can't be bloody serious!&#34; Spike exclaimed looking at the object Giles had just thrust in his direction.</p>

<p>&#34;If he doesn't want it, I'll take it,&#34; Xander graciously volunteered.</p>

<p>&#34;I bet you would,&#34; Spike responded shooting Xander and irritated look, but hugging the flashlight closer to him nonetheless. &#34;Who was the git that came up with this brilliant idea anyway?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;In her former confrontation with the demon Buffy discovered the light damaged it,&#34; Giles responded shifting the sword he had flung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, and look how bloody well that turned out for her,&#34; Spike replied without missing a beat.</p>

<p>&#34;If you're too scared to go through with this, then just leave,&#34; Willow said speaking for the first time since the disagreement started.</p>

<p>&#34;Scared?! I'm William the goddamn Bloody and you think I'm scared of some cross-eyed, overgrown, newt?&#34; Spike declared clearly insulted. &#34;Well, sucks to that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;William the Bloody, Attila the Hun…it doesn't change the fact that you're a yellow-bellied coward with hair to match. After all that Buffy's done for you-despite all reason-after all that we've all done for you, you still can't see past your own desires…fine I get it, you're evil. So I'm not going to pretend to be shocked or disappointed by your complete lack of a spine. But next time you're getting ready to impale yourself on a stake, don't expect anyone to come running to your rescue encouraging you to go on,&#34; Willow responded shaking her head-for despite what she said she was disappointed with the way Spike was acting. There was some decent part of the vampire, she was sure of it. Sure, that part was deeply hidden-deeply, deeply hidden- but she was certain that it existed. &#34;Come on,&#34; she said turning to Giles and Xander.</p>

<p>Spike watched them begin to walk away.</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't say I wasn't going to come!&#34; he called after them. &#34;I just question the wisdom of using a person who got their ass kicked as a template,&#34; he muttered under his breath as he jogged to catch up to them.</p>

<p>Giles took one last look at the map and directed them into the final tunnel that would take them to the final grotto of the caves. The walk had been silent, tense, and though Giles wouldn't admit it if someone asked-not that he actually expected anyone too-but he was looking forward to getting in there and making the demon pay for what it had done to all of them.</p>

<p>&#34;This it?&#34; Xander asked when Giles came to a stop.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;Lights on,&#34; he continued and dutifully all of them turned on their flashlights.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you going to count to three, or can we just bloody go in?&#34; Spike asked positively hopping up and down. He had been in much better spirits since finding out he could hurt demons-which wasn't by any means saying that he was in good spirits.</p>

<p>&#34;Let's go,&#34; Giles said waving his hand towards the opening.</p>

<p>Xander was the first into the opening, and just as he always wanted it WAS much in the style of John Wayne.</p>

<p>&#34;We've come to kick ass and chew bubble gum! And guess what, we're all out of bubble gum!&#34; Xander declared flashing the lights beam around the cave.</p>

<p>The moment he finished speaking, the room was filled with a wretched screeching sound, then the room erupted into a fury of motion.</p>
