<p><b>THANK YOU</b> for all the reviews! All of you are amazing and flat out awesome. :)</p>
<p><b>lita rocks LbC</b>, I'm so glad you mentioned them being in that stage even though they're already best friends and have been for a very long time. I was really hoping someone would pick up on that.</p>

NINE</b></p>
<p>Miley slid her arms into the sleeves of Lilly's dark blue jacket, zipping it up all the way as the breeze coming off of the ocean chilled her. "Are you sure you're okay with me wearing this?" she asked Lilly, not for the first time in the past thirty seconds. She pulled the sleeves over her hands and held them in front of her face, hiding her grin as she inhaled deeply. "You smell good."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, turning light pink. "Please wear it. I'm not that cold."</p>
<p>"Thank you." Miley replied, leaning down to kiss the blonde's cheek softly. She watched as Lilly's smiled grew into a full-blown grin.</p>
<p>"Can you tell me about… well, what happened the first time you had a dream about me?" Lilly asked as she removed her flip flops, letting her toes sink into the sand beneath her. The sound of waves filled her ears, but it was Miley's voice that caught her attention.</p>
<p>Miley looked at her, her eyebrows shooting up in disbelief. "You're completely serious, aren't you? You really want to know?" She did the same with her own flip flops, holding them in one hand. She took Lilly's with her free hand and laced their fingers together, a slow smile spreading across her face as she looked down at their joined hands.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do." Lilly nodded with a grin, "You don't have to go into detail or anything, but like… what the heck did you do when you woke up from it?"</p>
<p>"Ah, well…" Miley paused for a moment, exhaling slowly. "I woke up and… it's a little embarrassing, Lilly." She shrugged, heat filling her entire face. "I mean, before that I've never had such a – well, it was like so many things coming at me at once. Not only did I freak out because I just had a sex dream about my best <i>girl</i> friend, but I also freaked out because the dream gave me this intense, totally incredible feeling that I never felt before."</p>
<p>"And by that, you mean…?"</p>
<p>"An orgasm." Miley confirmed, her voice dropping. Her face reddened even more than it had before. "I, um, sometimes have them before I wake up, but… man, the first time was insane." She trapped her bottom lip between her teeth, fighting the grin that wanted to break out on her face. "Then other times I don't have one."</p>
<p>"So… what happened the other day, Miles?" Lilly asked with a small smile, "In the shower? I mean, I can understand you freaking out about this, but what made you break down in there?"</p>
<p>The desire to grin faded instantly as Miley released her bottom lip. "You remember I just had that dream – you know, on the couch?" Lilly nodded. "Well, you woke me up before I – I could finish."</p>
<p>"Which is why you were so jumpy afterward." Lilly said mostly to herself. "You didn't even want me to touch you."</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry about that. I didn't mean to hurt you." Miley whispered sadly. Lilly squeezed her hand, encouraging her to continue. "I went upstairs to, uh, finish the job, and when I did, I yelled out your name, and it was like… God, I couldn't just leave it <i>alone</i>! I had to go do something about it because I was so turned on and then I slipped up when you were so close by. And then you were in there in the bathroom with me and I couldn't even explain to you what the hell was wrong with me. I didn't know what to do. I just felt so weak and cowardly because I couldn't even tell my best friend that I was going through something I can't get away from."</p>
<p>"Can I ask you a question?" Lilly wondered, adding, "It might be hard to answer, but I want you to be completely honest."</p>
<p>"Sure. Go ahead." Miley responded.</p>
<p>Lilly stopped where she was, motioning for Miley to do the same. She then lifted her eyes to meet the brunette's. "If you could – I mean – you get a lot of… pleasure from these dreams. Do you want to stop having them? If you could choose, would you want to keep having them, or not?"</p>
<p>Miley was silent for a moment as she mulled it over. After a few moments, she turned her head to the side, unable to look at Lilly any longer. "That <i>is</i> hard to answer. I like having them. I like the feelings I get after I have them and I like that it's you who gives them to me. But no, I wouldn't want to have them. I feel disgusting, like I'm violating you somehow, and I never want to do that. I don't ever want to make you uncomfortable in any way. You have to know that."</p>
<p>"I do know that, Miles." Lilly said simply, moving to stand right in front of the taller girl. "I told you before that you're not disgusting. I think it's only natural for you to like them, but the fact that you'd give them up for me tells me a lot. I know you'd never do anything to hurt me, Miley."</p>
<p>Before Miley could say anything else, Lilly dropped her flip flops and wrapped both of her arms around her neck, pulling her into a searing kiss. Miley's eyes widened as her own flip flops fell from her limp hand. She then kissed Lilly back and closed her eyes, losing herself in the passion the blonde was evoking within her. They stayed like that for long minutes before Miley pulled back, leaning her forehead against Lilly's.</p>
<p>"We should go back to your house now." Lilly whispered and brushed her lips against the brunette's.</p>
<p>"…Does this mean I finally get my present?"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"I think I know a way for you to stop having those dreams…"</p>
<p>Miley sat down on her bed facing Lilly, the blonde's jacket wrapped tightly around her slim frame. Running a hand through her hair, Miley looked up at Lilly who stood between her legs.</p>
<p>"You think?" She questioned.</p>
<p>As Lilly nodded with a small smile, Miley felt a flare of hope in her chest. The hope was instantly met with a pang of disappointment. She <i>really</i> didn't want to be cut off from the pleasure that she got every night. It was something she'd come to depend on – that no matter what, at least one good thing would happen every day. Maybe it was stupid, thinking like that, but… she just couldn't help it. These dreams had become a part of her life and it would be hard when she had to deal with not having them. But then… her friendship with Lilly was more important than her dreams. If she had to give them up, she'd be okay because the girl would still be with her.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?" Miley wondered. "I'm all ears."</p>
<p>Lilly cupped her cheeks and tilted her head upward to capture her lips, not answering for long moments. Miley licked her lips once Lilly broke the kiss, trying hard to focus on the girl in front of her and not how dizzy the kiss had made her.</p>
<p>"What would you say if… I told you that maybe… we could stop them," Lilly asked haltingly, running her fingers through Miley's dark curls, "Together?"</p>
<p>Miley's heart fluttered as she processed Lilly's words – or tried to, at least. Her mouth opened and closed a few times before she cleared her throat. "What do you mean?" she choked out finally.</p>
<p>"Close your eyes, I want to give you your present now." Lilly said abruptly, "And no peeking."</p>
<p>"Okay…?" Miley covered her eyes with her hands, knowing she wouldn't be able to keep them closed. She felt Lilly move away from her and barely resisted the urge to drop her hands.</p>
<p>"I hope you don't mind, but I didn't spend any money on a good gift present this year. I, ah, decided to get you something that I couldn't find at a store anywhere." Lilly started, and Miley could hear her voice waver, "Now I know I asked you if what happened earlier counted as a birthday present, but I decided to go ahead and give you this, too."</p>
<p>"What is it?" Miley asked impatiently as the bed dipped beside her. She felt Lilly's arm brush against her own and fought the urge to shiver at the soft touch. "…Lilly?" she called out softly when Lilly didn't respond.</p>
<p>"I've been… debating on whether I should do this or not," Lilly continued finally, "But tonight we had our first date and it was <i>wonderful</i>."</p>
<p>Miley couldn't keep herself from giggling. "Yes, it was."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed before continuing, "Yes, and I got to know a whole other side to you, one I've never seen as just your best friend… you were so fun and honest and even when you probably wanted to do anything else, you were open about everything. Heck, you even told me what happened after the first dream you had about me, which takes a lot of guts. I admire that, Miley. Tonight I saw a side of you that I'd like to see more of, if you'll let me."</p>
<p>"Of course I will." Miley said softly, "I want that more than anything."</p>
<p>"Are you ready to open your eyes?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded eagerly. "Hell yes. I've been waiting for it all night."</p>
<p>"Okay, then." Lilly relented, "Go ahead, open them."</p>
<p>Miley dropped her hands to her lap and revealed bright blue-grey eyes that clouded in confusion as she turned her body to face her friend. "Um, Lil… what are you giving me?" she asked, noting the lack of anything that looked even remotely close to a present.</p>
<p>"I'm giving you the <i>real</i> Lilly Truscott."</p>
