<!-- Waiting \ null -->

<p>So I'm sitting here waiting, sitting on a concrete slab adjacent to
the steps leading up to Sunnydale High School, wondering exactly what
the fuck I'm doing here.</p>

<p>To dumb down the concept to it's most simple parts, as Giles would
doubtlessly say, I'm waiting for Buffy. We've got a lunch date. Of
course, Buffy also has school, but she's hardly gonna let such a
thing as trigonometry let her miss out on spending 'quality' time
(note the sarcastic quotation marks - added myself) with me. Of
course, it'll probably end up the two of us freaking out customers at
the local Burger King by feeding each other fries as seductively as
possible before retiring to her place for a little tumble in the sack
while her mom's still at work, but hey, with all that ahead - who am
I to tell her to stay in trig? Besides, I wasn't exactly the most
committed student when I was in high school - that is, when I
actually bothered to go to school. Or when my mother actually
remembered that I had to go to school.</p>

<p>I actually didn't mind going to school, back when they still let me
enter a school. It was an excuse not to stay at home, at any rate -
but I don't like to think about home, so I skip those thoughts as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should start at the beginning. I'm Faith, I'm from Boston,
I'm eighteen, I'm a Slayer, I love Buffy Summers and she loves me,
and I'm waiting for her.</p>

<p>And wondering why I'm waiting for her.</p>

<p>Oh, just so you know - B isn't the first girlfriend I've had. Well,
she is kinda. That is, she's the first one I've really cared about,
the first one I've truly enjoyed knowing, enjoyed being with, enjoyed
loving. If your definition of 'girlfriend' or 'lover' is 'someone you
can't bare to be without for more than half an hour and someone who
occupies your mind every waking and sleeping moment, someone, in
short, with whom you've fallen completely in love with', then yeah,
Buffy's the first.</p>

<p>However, if your definition of 'girlfriend' or 'lover' fits more
around 'someone you fuck several times then generally lose interest
in, to the extent that the mere possibility of feeling something like
love for this person sends you into hysterics', then B definitely
isn't the first. Not by a long shot. Back home in Boston, I wasn't
exactly known for my stability in relationships. I tended to go for
the gorgeous chicks with nice tits and hot asses or the guys you
could just tell packed a pretty impressive package. Usually, it was a
different chick or guy every night, then I'd send them packing. Oh,
some of them I spent more time with - but it got old real quick, you
know? I'd feel tied down and cramped in no time. Oh, and couple that
with the time I'd spend chasing (and, more often than not, scoring)
anything with a cute butt - male or female. Didn't exactly make for
long-lasting romantic bonds with people.</p>

<p>Or it'd be the other way. I'd be with someone, and I'd feel really
good, but then I'd start to feel different. I'd start to enjoy being
with them, I'd like them, I'd see them in completely different eyes,
and then I'd realize - I was falling for them. And of course, any
hint of love sends me spiralling into a blind panic and I'd get the
hell outta there before dooming us both to a life of heartbreak and
misery.</p>

<p>So how come I'm so hung up on B now? Why is it rather than dragging
myself off to new places and finding new scores, I'm waiting here to
go out on a date? How come I'm still hanging around even though I'm
way beyond the point of no return? How come I've let myself fall in
love with her?</p>

<p>It's certainly not Sunnydale, that's for goddamn certain. And not
because it's situated above a portal leading to a dimension populated
entirely by demons, resulting it being a beacon for every vampire and
blood sucking freak in the world. Hell, I like that part. It means I
get to kick some serious ass without any repercussions. Hell, the
school psychologists always said I had a problem controlling my
aggression. Perfect solution - beat the crap not out of people who
you hate, who piss you off somehow or who just somehow happen to get
in your way when you're completely smashed, out of the things society
calls monsters. No therapy, no smug psychologist bastard turning
everything you say into a metaphor for how fucked up you are. Kick
the crap out of something, gets rid of all the rage, leaves you
feeling only hungry and horny afterwards. And with Buffy around,
those are both pretty good things to feel - especially when she does
this little thing with her tongue and a tub of peanut butter...</p>

<p>Oh. Wait a second. Where was I?</p>

<p>Oh yeah. Sunnydale. Mouth of Hell, all that. Yeah, well, the
Hellmouth's great.</p>

<p>The town itself, however, is conservative suburbanite picket fence
death for a girl like me.</p>

<p>Christ, one look around the place'll tell you that. Place is so
goddamn saccharine it's not funny. It's like a throwback to the
fifties, somewhere like Mayberry or one of those towns in things like
Leave it to Beaver where everyone's got a picket fence and spends
their time grinning inanely and waving to each other. Talk about a
Pleasantville nightmare. No wonder the Hellmouth's taken up residence
here - you look for evil in places like Sarajevo, places that have
had the shit blown out of them and all the hope kicked out of them
with metal jackboots. You don't look in places with names like
goddamn Sunnydale. Sounds like something outta 'The Smurfs', fer
chrissakes.</p>

<p>Which brings me very neatly to the other point about Sunnydale. It's
all pretty much rich conservative hetero white folks who are living
epitomes of the Moral Majority. Which means there aren't exactly a
lot of people who have open alternate sexualities. Or any sexualities
at all, it seems. Jesus, you'd think the people here were allergic to
getting laid. Before Buffy and I started getting up close and
personal, I was about ready to explode. There's only a certain length
of time you can push your own buttons before you begin to crack.</p>

<p>No sirrie, if Buffy wasn't here, then this goddamn piece of shit town
would have kissed my beautiful ass goodbye a long time ago. Hell,
usually a piece of flesh I have in any town's not enough to keep me
down once it's time to move on.</p>

<p>Which, once again, reminds me why I stay here.</p>

<p>Buffy.</p>

<p>The sex doesn't matter when I'm with Buffy. No wait, I can't lie
about that. The sex is important, (and it's great, incidentally), but
it's not just sex, you know? It's something more, something better
than the best orgasms ever experienced - and I've had some of them,
let me tell you. It's like we connect when we make love, and I've
never felt that before. She's more to me than just a good lay, that's
for certain. We talk - we connect. I've told her things I'd never
tell anyone else, things about my childhood, about my Mom and
her 'friends', about the pain and fear I experienced everyday, about
hiding around school overnight rather than go home to another evening
of beatings and abuse. And she listens. And she still loves me, and I
still love her, and despite the fact that she knows all this I'm
still here. I'm waiting for her, and she wants to meet me. Why?</p>

<p>Maybe it's because we're both Slayers - Giles reckons we have this
connection, deep down, 'cos we go through things no one except the
other can possibly understand. Not Xander, not Red, not her Mom,
hell, not even Giles. No one except me and her truly understands what
it is to live this life. Maybe that's why I like being with her so
much. Maybe that's why I love her so much. I mean, if either she or I
hadn't been a Slayer and we'd met, we'd probably have loathed each
other. As it happens, I can hardly breath when she's not around. And
frankly, that scares the shit outta me.</p>

<p>I'm not used to being in love. I don't think I've ever been in love
before, actually, and it frightens me. I'm not good with the whole
emotion-love-relationship thing, as you might guess, and I'm
frightened that I'll do something to screw it up, or that one morning
she'll wake up and realize I'm a messed-up freak and decide I'm not
worthy to be on the same planet as her. And the funny thing is, both
of those fears are entirely valid. In my mind at least - she's
repeatedly tried to assure me on both accounts, but self-doubt and
paranoia are two of my oldest friends.</p>

<p>Now normally, if I even felt a quarter of what I feel about Buffy
about someone, my bags would be packed and I'd be outta there. So why
haven't I?</p>

<p>Why am I putting myself through this whole relationship thing?</p>

<p>Why am I preparing myself for what could be heartache?</p>

<p>How come I love Buffy Summers enough to hang around outside a school
and go on a date with her when every instinct I have screams at me to
run and find a simple airhead I can screw and forget?</p>

<p>"Hey."</p>

<p>She's trotting down the school steps now, blonde hair glinting in the
California light, wearing a nice black top and a pair of not-too-
tight blue jeans. Much better than the pastels she likes. There's
something about Buffy that makes me wanna grab her and run to the
nearest warm, comfy bed, climb in with her, and never climb out
again, and yet feeling this way kinda makes me wanna run as far as I
can out of town and away from feeling this way. And there's yet
another part of me that just wants to hold her tight and never let go
ever again. Jesus, is falling in love meant to be this complicated?</p>

<p>In the end, I just settle for the middle ground in replying
with "Hey." and then giving her a kiss on the lips. Not a really
deep, lustful, passionate kiss that seizes us or the tiny little
pecks we usually grace each other with after we've made love. Just a
nice kiss, a bit of tongue, lips meeting softly. The kind of kiss
people in love give each other. Nothing special. It'd probably get
Xander's grand libido stimulated, but then that boy'd get horny
seeing us shaking hands.</p>

<p>When we break apart, she's smiling and my lips taste of strawberry.
It's probably her lip gloss, but I have a sneaking suspicion she
tastes like that naturally. It suits her.</p>

<p>"You look...great. In those clothes." What is it about this girl?
She
can knock my I.Q back into single figures with just her presence, one
word and a kiss. She can keep me in this dead-end town full of
repressed losers and hideous monsters, and keep me by her side when
usually if a relationship even hinted at going this far or if I got
tired of it I'd be on my way faster than a cheetah.</p>

<p>Her smile grows slightly more wicked. "Thanks. You too look great.
Especially in those clothes." She leans closer and whispers. "So
great, in fact, that I'm thinking of getting you out of those
clothes." Her hand entwines with mine, delicate, soft fingers criss-
crossing with my own. "You ready to go, babe?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you are."</p>

<p>As she drags me off, still holding my hand, away from the school
through the tree-lined streets to - wherever, I begin wondering once
again what it is about her that makes me stay here beside her, makes
me follow her wherever, makes me love her so much that I weather all
this fear and uncertainty just to be in her presence.</p>

<p>And then, for a while at least, I decide it doesn't matter. It's a
lovely day, Buffy's with me, and I love her more than anything, my
own life included. It doesn't matter why - all that matters is that
it is, and I'm gonna make sure that this is the way it stays forever.</p>

<p>And no one's gonna screw it up. Especially not me.</p>
