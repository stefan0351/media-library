<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 3 -->

<p>Sam sneaked a glance at Brooke for the hundreth time, concerned at the blonde's recent behaviour. After Alex had left she had walked into the kitchen to find Brooke banging her head against the table. </p>
		<p>Her earlier rudeness towards Alex was also uncharacteristic. Brooke was popular, and vain and arrogant and blonde, but she really was quite nice, and for the life of her, Sam just couldn't figure it out.</p>
		<p>Brooke had been quiet after the banging of the head incident, no doubt sporting a headache, and if Sam had to use one word to describe the blonde's demeanor, sad would have fit the bill perfectly. She knew the headache wasn't just the cause of it.</p>
		<p>She wanted to ask the blonde if she was alright, but she guessed that Brooke wouldn't confide in her, hurting a little at that thought. <i>I wish she would trust me. </i></p>
		<p>So instead, Sam suggested a movie, which earned her a small smile, and here they were sitting on the couch. <i>Quite closely too, </i>Sam noticed, quite happy at the fact. <i>Don't go there, Sam.</i></p>
		<p>Sam sneaked another glance, this time admiring the cheerleader's profile. <i>She really is beautiful. </i></p>
		<p><i>And she looks like Alex! </i>The annoying voice returned with glee.</p>
		<p>"Stupid bitch, shut the hell up!" Sam cried.</p>
		<p>"You alright there?" Brooke replied, looking at Sam as if she had grown a second beautiful head. <i>Hmmm, Siamese Sam. Interesting. </i></p>
		<p><i>On second thought, scary.</i></p>
		<p>"Sorry. Just ignore me".</p>
		<p>"Right". <i>Like I ever could.</i></p>
		<p>They continued watching the movie, this time without interruption, until the credits rolled three hours later. Both stared at the screen, half in shock, half in confusion. It was Sam that finally spoke, breaking the long silence.</p>
		<p>"Brooke?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"What the fuck was that?"</p>
		<p>Brooke began laughing, so hard, that tears began streaming down her face. Sam watched in wonder as Brooke slowly regained control. <i>Stunning. She is stunning. </i></p>
		<p>"Beats me", she finally replied wiping a tear away. </p>
		<p>Sam picked up the dvd cover of Mulholland Drive and stared at it. </p>
		<p>"That David Lynch is one weird man. Wouldn't want a tour inside his head".</p>
		<p>Brooke stared at her for a moment. "Why'd you borrow this anyway?"</p>
		<p>"Heard good things about it. And I like his movies". <i>That's not the only reason, Sammy.</i></p>
		<p>"The actresses were great." Brook replied. <i>They really were great. And friggin' sexy. Those love scenes...wow. </i>She paused. </p>
		<p><i>Should i? Why the hell not.</i></p>
		<p>"You know<i>,</i> If I ever became a citizen of the Isle of Lesbos, I wouldn't say no to the brunnette". <i>There! What do you make of that, Sam?</i></p>
		<p>Sam stared at Brooke for a moment, not quite believing her ears. <i>Oh, really?! </i></p>
		<p>"I prefer the blonde myself." Sam answered, finally.</p>
		<p>They became silent, staring at each other, either not knowing what to say to that. </p>
		<p>"I'm tired. I think I'll go to bed. Thanks for the movie." <i>Note to self. Cold shower first.</i>  </p>
		<p>With a parting smile, Brooke headed for her bedroom. Sam leaned back and closed her eyes, her heart racing. <i>Alex, who?</i></p>
		<p>"Anytime, Brooke. Anytime." </p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Sam pulled her head out from the closet and stopped what she was doing. </p>
		<p><i>I don''t want to</i></p>
		<p><i>Sing another love song, baby</i></p>
		<p><i>I don't want to</i></p>
		<p><i>Hum another melody</i></p>
		<p><i>I don't want to</i></p>
		<p><i>Live my life with you, babe</i></p>
		<p><i>It's driving me crazy</i></p>
		<p><i>Again? Aargh! </i></p>
		<p>Brooke had come home from cheerleading practice, and had gone straight up to her room without a word to anybody, where she had proceeded to play Toni Braxton. </p>
		<p>On repeat. </p>
		<p><i>If I never feel you in my arms again</i></p>
		<p><i>If I never feel your tender kiss again</i></p>
		<p><i>If I never hear I love you once again</i></p>
		<p><i>Will I never make love to you once again</i></p>
		<p><i>Please understand</i></p>
		<p><i>If love ends</i></p>
		<p><i>Then I promise you, I promise you that</i></p>
		<p><i>That I shall never breathe</i></p>
		<p><i>Breathe Again, breathe again</i></p>
		<p><i>That I shall never breathe again</i></p>
		<p><i>What on earth is going on?</i> If Sam didn't know any better she would have guessed that Brooke was going through a painful break up. The weird behaviour from last night, the depressing songs, it all added up. To the best of her knowledge, Brooke wasn't with anybody. Was she? Unless of course...</p>
		<p>Unless of course, she still had feelings for Josh. That must be it. </p>
		<p>Sam ignored the stab of pain at the thought and decided to cheer the blonde up. Or at the very least, distract her a little. </p>
		<p><i>She can help me figure out what to wear for my date tonight. </i></p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Brooke lay on her bed, eyes closed, trying to ignore the knocking at her door. </p>
		<p><i>Couldn't they understand she was busy here?!  </i></p>
		<p>Wanting nothing more than to be alone, and especially wanting to forget Sam's date tonight, she had barricaded herself in her room, with only the soulful voice of Toni Braxton to keep her company, finding some measure of comfort in her songs of pain and heartache.</p>
		<p><i>Since you've been gone</i></p>
		<p><i>I keep thinking about you baby</i></p>
		<p><i>Gets me all choked up</i></p>
		<p><i>This heart of mine keeps dreaming of you and it's crazy</i></p>
		<p><i>You'd think I had enough</i></p>
		<p><i>As soon as I get you out my head </i></p>
		<p><i>I'm in my car again</i></p>
		<p><i>Just one request from the radio</i></p>
		<p><i>I'm back in love, sugar, once again</i></p>
		<p><i>It's just another sad love song...</i></p>
		<p>"Go away!"</p>
		<p>"Come on Brooke, please. Let me in".</p>
		<p>Brooke sighed. She never could deny Sam anything. Opening the door, she found Sam standing there with a smile on her face. Entering the room, Sam headed straight for the c.d player and switched it off.</p>
		<p>"There. That's better".</p>
		<p>"Hey! I was listening to that!"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I know. Listening to it again, and again and again".</p>
		<p>"What do you want? Because I'd like to get back to listening to it again and again and again."</p>
		<p>"Brooke, are you ok? Talk to me. You know you can, right?"</p>
		<p><i>Must resist, big, brown, bambi eyes. Must resist. </i></p>
		<p>""I'm okay."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh. I can see that".</p>
		<p>"I'm fine. But thanks for your concern. Now if that is all". Brooke tried unsuccessfully to shepherd Sam out the door. </p>
		<p>"Look, I can see that you won't confide in me and I'm sorry that our past has gotten us to this point, where you feel that you can't trust me. I just want you to know that if you ever needed someone to talk to, I'm here. I don't want to see you upset, Brooke, not if I can help it."</p>
		<p>Brooke stared at her, touched by her words. <i>If only you could.</i></p>
		<p>"Thanks Sam, I appreciate it. But it's something that I need to get over by myself." <i>And I don't think I ever can.</i></p>
		<p>"Okay. But my offer still stands." Sam smiled. "Anyway, Ms Fashion Expert, I was wondering if you could help me out. I can't decide whether to wear this, or this, tonight".</p>
		<p>Brooke's smile faltered, but through sheer force of will, she managed to keep her voice light, and the smile plastered on her face. </p>
		<p>"The blue shirt. It looks good on you." B<i>esides, the red one is my favourite, and I don't want him to see you in it.</i></p>
		<p>"Blue it is then!" Sam smiled and headed towards the door. "Thanks Brooke".</p>
		<p>"No problem. Have fun tonight". </p>
		<p>And with one last smile, Sam left, leaving Brooke to pick up the million shattered pieces of her broken heart. <i>So that is what it feels like. </i></p>
		<p>She flopped onto her bed and covered her eyes, trying hard not to cry. <i>Pressing play. </i></p>
		<p><i>Here comes the strings</i></p>
		<p><i>Then somebody sings</i></p>
		<p><i>Only takes a beat</i></p>
		<p><i>And then it starts killing me darling</i></p>
		<p><i>Only takes one note, I tell ya from that radio</i></p>
		<p><i>It's just</i></p>
		<p><i>Another</i></p>
		<p><i>Lonely</i></p>
		<p><i>Love song</i></p>
