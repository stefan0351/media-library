<!-- World Without Love \ Part 12 -->

<p><i>Notes: okay here a little brush up on your knowledge about Klingons: brak'lul is the medical phenomenon of Klingon's having every major organ two times. Klingons howl after one of their one has passed away, to warn the dead warriors in Stovokor, that a new warrior is joining them. .If you don't know what Stovokor is . then Kahless help you!</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna ground her teeth together. She was tired, but she couldn't sleep. Hence she had come down to Engineering, to see if something needed to be done. There had been nothing. So here she was now, in the section where the plasma regenerator was located, trying to get some work done alone.</p>

		<p>Just because she wanted to forget what she had done last night. She couldn't believe how she could have been that stupid. To run out on Seven. Again! And then throwing a hasty "I love you" at her.</p>

		<p>That was not how she had planned to tell Seven she loved her. And she would never get the chance to do that again.</p>

		<p>There was only one first.</p>

		<p>To top everything off, she still didn't know how Seven was feeling.</p>

		<p>"Damn! Why doesn't this stupid thing work?" She shouted at the machine that refused to work.</p>

		<p>She was about to begin a string of curses when, suddenly, she heard a hiss and air moving. The hiss grew stronger and suddenly one of the walls of the room she was in collapsed. Everything that was loose was being sucked into space. Thanks to B'Elanna's Klingon reflexes she was able to grab a hold of the machine that was anchored to the floor of the room.</p>

		<p>Now she heard the red alert. Breathing was becoming almost impossible as more and more air was being sucked into the black nothingness just outside of the confines of Voyager. When B'Elanna finally felt an emergency beam gripping her, the machine she had hung on to exploded.</p>

		<p>The beam disposed the unconscious form of the chief engineer on the main biobed in Voyager's sick bay.</p>

		<p>She had a few burns from the explosion but since the beam had taken her away before the actual thing happened it wasn't as bad as it could have been.</p>

		<p>The doctor rushed to her side.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant? Can you hear me Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>She obviously couldn't hear him. He ran a few scans over her body and worked furiously on the biobed, injecting various hypo-sprays into her lifeless body.</p>

		<p>Suddenly the irregular beeping that came from the biobed changed to a never ending long beep-tone. The doctor was furiously hitting buttons on the biobed controls.</p>

		<p>"Her hearts have stopped beating. Starting resuscitation measures," he said for the computer recording the accident protocols.</p>

		<p>He hit a button. "Now!"</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon's body convulsed briefly, but the constant noise didn't change.</p>

		<p>Seven was standing a few feet away from the biobed looking on as the Doctor worked on reviving B'Elanna Torres.</p>

		<p>The woman she loved.</p>

		<p>She had just entered sick bay. She had heard that B'Elanna had been working on the plasma generator when it had exploded and wanted to make sure she was alright. Taking in the sight of the doctor almost desperately working on B'Elanna, she was painfully aware that her beloved was not alright.</p>

		<p>She wanted to step forward. Do something. Do anything. This whole scene brought back unwelcome memories of the nightmare she had had not so long ago.</p>

		<p>'B'Elanna mustn't die.' That was the only thought in Seven's brain. She still hadn't told her, that she ... loved her.</p>

		<p>But she couldn't do anything.</p>

		<p>"And again!"</p>

		<p>The doctor hit again the button, that was very quickly becoming B'Elanna's lifeline.</p>

		<p>Her body convulsed again. Nothing, the never ending beep resumed.</p>

		<p>The doctor worked over half an hour on reviving B'Elanna. He failed. The steady beep wouldn't change into the reoccurring beep tone that would indicate her being alive.</p>

		<p>"Exitus. 1123 hours. Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres," the doctor said for the computer to record.</p>

		<p>Seven heard the words. She didn't want to hear them. To acknowledge that B'Elanna was dead.</p>

		<p>She silently began crying. She cried for the love she had just lost, for the friend she had lost and she cried because she knew nobody would ever again make her feel like B'Elanna had done.</p>

		<p>She went to the biobed where her love lay dead. She took one of B'Elanna's hands. Closed her eyes. And remembered what B'Elanna would want her to do.</p>

		<p>She raised her head to the ceiling and let out a bone shattering howl. It was heard on all decks of Voyager. And in the widths of Stovokor itself.</p>

		<p>Shortly after she had begun, a weak beep had started again.</p>

		<p>She didn't hear it, since was concentrating on her howl.</p>

		<p>"No need to warn them of me coming, I am still here." a soft voice whispered.</p>

		<p>A voice. B'Elanna's voice.</p>

		<p>Seven stopped. She would always hear THAT voice.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna? How? What?" Seven was confused, sad and glad at the same time.</p>

		<p>The doctor had been a silent onlooker till now, only running scans over the suddenly alive again Klingon, whom he had declared dead just a minute or so ago.</p>

		<p>"It seems that your second heart started working again. After it had stopped beating together with your other heart. - This is a wonder. I have never heard of the brak'lul working in a Klingon hybrid, before."</p>

		<p>"She'll live. You mean she'll live?" Seven asked, awe in her voice. And tears, now ones of joy, streaming down her face.</p>

		<p>"Don't cry, love. Please don't cry," B'Elanna pleaded with Seven.</p>

		<p>A smile broke out on Seven's face a bright and glorious smile. "I love you, too."</p>

		<p>The doctor cleared his throat to remind them, that he was still in the room.</p>

		<p>"It's not over, yet, B'Elanna," he informed his patient. "As an after-effect of the cardiac infarct you have suffered, as a result of the shock the accident gave you, one of your hearts is now in a state of cardiac necrosis. I am afraid I have to remove it before it does any damage," he paused, seeing the fearful look on the normally brave Klingon and the same reflected on Seven's face, he added, "You will be able to live with one heart, but we have to remove this one, immediately."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna nodded understandingly, though she hadn't understood most of the medical jargon the doctor had used. She looked up at Seven standing next to her.</p>

		<p>"Will you stay with me, " she asked, "please?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," Seven simply replied. And gave the doctor a look threatening him to not remove her presence.</p>

		<p>The doctor shortly thought about what the ex-Borg could do to him, and gave in. He was still surprised by the admission of love he had witnessed a few moments earlier, but since he had seen it coming not quite as much as it would have otherwise. He was after all Seven's friend and what made her happy made him happy.</p>

		<p>He turned to quickly prepare the operation and hailed Paris to help him. Tom was the only medical aide he had that was capable of assisting in the surgery he was about to perform. Though the doctor wasn't sure if Voyager's pilot could handle the emotional stress of performing major surgery on his ex-girlfriend.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The surgery took three hours and more than once the doctor nearly lost B'Elanna. The only thing that saved her was her sturdy Klingon physiology.</p>

		<p>After these few hours Seven was completely exhausted, mentally exhausted. It had not been easy to watch as the woman she loved had been dead and then later on came near death again. She however refused to leave sick bay and told the doctor, that she would stay till B'Elanna was conscious again.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Okay, people. I want answers. Why is my chief engineer in sick bay with only one heart still beating? And why is there a hole in my ship?"</p>

		<p>Captain Janeway's voice sounded determined and grim as she addressed the assembled senior officers. B'Elanna and Seven's seats being empty.</p>

		<p>Kim began to speak: "It looks like the atmosphere of PXX345 has exceptionally high levels of Xenon. When we entered orbit around the planet a reaction between that Xenon and the Palladium in the reinforced hull of section 34 beta, where B'Elanna was working on the plasma generator, started."</p>

		<p>Kim had been the one to whom Janeway had assigned the task of finding out what had happened. And that he had.</p>

		<p>"The two elements reacted to Palladiumxenit which is very porous. So the hull, where Palladium was in, collapsed, " he explained.</p>

		<p>Janeway wasn't satisfied with that. "That doesn't explain the explosion, or why it only collapsed when we had already been in orbit for hours."</p>

		<p>"Errrmmm, the explosion happened, because the plasma generator is very sensitive to radiation, the Palladium was supposed to reinforce the hull in that particular section and keep any radiation out. When it came into contact with the space radiation, the apparatus ... exploded. And we don't know why the hull only collapsed after a few hours," Kim replied dutifully.</p>

		<p>Janeway nodded. "Mr. Kim you're to continue the investigation, together with a security detail," she ordered him. Normally Tuvok would be in charge of that operation, but since engineering knowledge was needed for this investigation, she had decided to give him this opportunity to show off.</p>

		<p>"Which brings us to another problem we have now, how will we refine the dilithium ."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>a few days later</p>

		<p>B'Elanna once again glanced at the coordinates she had just programmed into the computer. She had no idea where they would take her, but a message from Seven had said to meet her there. And after a day of nothing other to do than rest in sick bay and having only the doctor for company she really wanted to talk to Seven, who had been occupied the whole day with her temporary duty as chief engineer.</p>

		<p>She stepped onto the transporter pad and announced: "Energise."</p>

		<p>As she was separated into her molecules and put back together in a different place, she felt the familiar tingle in her body. It felt good to do something again. After the days in sick bay and having to lie on that damned biobed for such long time, she enjoyed "being out again". Of course Seven's visits had made the whole recuperation thing sooo much more bearable but still.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled remembering how Seven had spent every available minute in sick bay, to be with her. The declarations of love. Seven's protective streak - the ex-Borg had done everything to keep the bored half-Klingon in sick bay for recuperation, when B'Elanna after only a day in sick bay had announced herself fit again. B'Elanna knew for herself that she had been too weak then, but still - even a few hours with only the doctor to keep her company.</p>

		<p>It was a cliff. B'Elanna was standing on a cliff. Looking at a breathtaking view of a setting sun in the horizon. The ocean before her seemed to swallow the big red fireball.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>It was only a whisper. It came from behind her.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna turned, looking at Seven. She was momentarily speechless, Seven was looking so beautiful in her dress.</p>

		<p>She knew she should say something, but not one syllable left her lips.</p>

		<p>Seven, too, didn't, couldn't say anything. She had beforehand laid out all her words carefully, but now everything she had wanted to tell the beautiful, strong Klingon, in front her, had left her.</p>

		<p>Seven took a step forward trying to say something anything. But she just couldn't say a damn thing.</p>

		<p>Seven and B'Elanna had talked much when Seven had been visiting the recuperating half-Klingon. About how they felt and what they wanted to do about it.</p>

		<p>Both wanted a relationship.</p>

		<p>In the last few days however Seven had come to acknowledge that she wanted more, much more.</p>

		<p>She was now only a few centimetres away from B'Elanna's face. Her eyes fixed on the full red lips of B'Elanna. And slowly and oh so gently she leant down, and brushed her lips to those of her beloved.</p>

		<p>"I love you. And I want to spend the rest of my life with you."</p>

		<p>Finally she had said it.</p>

		<p>The fearful look on B'Elanna's face became a smile. the brightest smile she had ever seen on the half-Klingon's face.</p>

		<p>"I ... Seven!"</p>

		<p>Not really wanting to say anything she let her deeds speak for her. She reached up and pulled Seven down, into a long, gentle and loving kiss.</p>

		<p>When they finally needed to come up for air, both were smiling radiantly at the other.</p>

		<p>"I love you, bang'wIj. And I never want to let go off you," she determinedly stated.</p>

		<p>And with that she pulled the tall blonde into her arms and hugged her fiercely.</p>
