<p>Okay, well here you guys go. Sorry about the slight delay. Hope you like it! R&R! REWIEW PLEASE!</p>

<hr size=1 noshade><p>We pulled up to the party, and got out of the car. I looked up at the house and felt a smile slowly growing on my lips. The house was huge. Long windows gave us a clear view inside, colored lights were flashing and you could hear the pulsing of the bass from where we stood on the lawn.</p>
<p>"Alright!" I heard Viola exclaim. "This is going to be fun."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but agree, this did look like fun. What sort of trouble would I manage to get myself into tonight? Possibly some concerning a certain brunet...</p>
<p>"Come on guys! Come on!" Called a very excited Viola, who was already almost at the steps.</p>
<p>I quickly walked after her, some part of me desperately wanting us to enter that door together. So that everyone would know that she had come with me, erm, with me, Duke and Andrew that is.</p>
<p><i>Oh please Olivia, </i>Said a sarcastic voice in my head, <i>Just stop denying it, you want her to be here with you. And only you.</i></p>
<p>I sighed inwardly, it was true. I wanted her to be mine.</p>
<p>I joined Vi on the top step and flashed her a quick smile. She smiled back, and for a moment I though I saw something flash in her green eyes, curiosity? Excitement? Passion? I couldn't place it. But it was gone as quickly as it had appeared, but I soon forgot about it as Viola grabbed my arm and pulled me through the towering double doors.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered, the energy in the room hit us like a wave. We were standing in a huge entry way, the ceilings had to be at least 16 ft tall, and directly in front of us was a huge stair way that went up to a balcony/hallway on the second floor. There were open doors to our left and right and lights and music were blaring out of each. People were every where, talking, laughing, dancing, singing, kissing, walking around waving around plastic cups, leaning over the balcony to yell at the people below. It was a lot to take in.</p>
<p>But Vi seemed completely unfazed and shouted at the first person who walked by us, "Where's the bar?"</p>
<p>The guy was obviously drunk, and it seemed apparent that if anyone knew where the bar was, he did. Low and behold he pointed off in the direction of the left door, then staggered off towards the stairs. I briefly wondered if he would end up falling down them. Viola and I seemed to be sharing the same thought because we looked at each other and grinned.</p>
<p>Vi then turned to Duke and Andrew, "Olivia and I are going to visit the alcohol, er, the bar." She said with an impish grin.</p>
<p>"Vi, you are so corruptive!" I laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, please Liv." Chuckled Viola, "You were already corrupted, I'm just helping you embrace it. Now come on, I'm thirsty."</p>
<p>And with that she started to walk off into the crowd.</p>
<p>"Remember Duke, you're driving!" I shouted back to him as I moved to follow the gently swaying hips of the fast disappearing brunet.</p>
<p>I caught up with her about halfway across the dance floor and we continued to push our way through the mass of bodies. When we reached the bar, a nice classy little wine counter which I could see had been used for many a private party, she leaned over to order our drinks, but I cut in. This one was my call.</p>
<p>"Two Kamikaze's please," I put as much authority in my voice as I could. "Lime, not lemon. Shaken, not stirred and no ice."</p>
<p>The guy behind the bar nodded and went to get the drinks.</p>
<p>I turned to Viola to see that she was looking at me appreciatively.</p>
<p>"Where the hell did that come from?" She asked.</p>
<p>It was my turn to grin evilly. "I actually had gone out a few times before I met you Mrs. Hastings."</p>
<p>"Yeah," She replied. "But we're not old enough to..."</p>
<p>I hushed her and without thinking pressed my finger against her lips. For a moment it just rested there and I couldn't believe I was actually touching them, they were so soft and warm and moist. I felt myself running my tongue over my own lips, wanting so bad to lean forward and press my...</p>
<p>I gave my head a slight shake, and dropped my finger.</p>
<p><i>Whoa, </i>I thought to myself. <i>Slow down there cowgirl, all in good time, all in good time. </i></p>
<p>"Don't worry about that," I said, attempting to pick up smoothly where I had left off, hoping she hadn't registered the heat of the moment. "He didn't ask, we didn't tell. There was no lying, no faking, no nothing, it was totally clean."</p>
<p>She looked at me for a moment and then started laughing, her perfect bell pealing laugh, and said, "I think I just fell in love with you."</p>
<p>I knew she was joking, but I couldn't help but blush at her words, and think fruitlessly, <i>Oh</i>, <i>if only.</i></p>
<p>A moment later the bar tender returned and handed us our drinks. I smiled at him and winked, just to lay it on thick. He seemed to blush a bit and quickly returned his attention to the glasses he was suddenly so interested in polishing.</p>
<p>I turned back to Vi and caught her looking at me, but she didn't glance away nervously as if she had been doing something wrong. She was simply looking at me, and I looked back at her. I was dieing to know what was going on behind those thoughtful eyes, what was she thinking, what was she feeling? After a moment she spoke.</p>
<p>"So, what's in a kamikaze anyway?"</p>
<p>"Oh you know," I answered jokingly, "lime juice, alcohol, alcohol, lime juice."</p>
<p>She looked at me with an amused expression.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." I said giving in, "triple sec...vodka... lime juice... and thats pretty much it!"</p>
<p>"Wow," she mused, "Thats pretty hard core, I'm actually very impressed."</p>
<p>She then lifted her glass and said, "To an evening we will never remember."</p>
<p>I laughed and echoed her words clinking our glasses. <i>Well, </i>I thought, <i>We'll be remembering some of it if I get my way,</i> then we both sipped our drinks. The alcohol hit the back of my throat in a rush and coursed down into my chest, sending a warm tingling feeling through my body, I could almost feel myself relax.</p>
<p>"Whoa!" Exclaimed Viola. "That is really good! Like I mean really good, like... Wow!"</p>
<p>I smiled, "Glad you like it, it's one of my favorites."</p>
<p>"I think it just became my favorite too."</p>
<p>We shared a warm smile and then lapsed into a comfortable silence, observing the party goers around us, and sipping our drinks contently.</p>
<p>A few minutes later however, a question which had been bothering me for some time floated into my head.</p>
<p>"Um, Vi?" I began nervously, there was something I needed to talk to her about before I made my next move, and before we both became too drunk to talk about anything seriously.</p>
<p>"Yeah Liv?" She seemed to have sensed the tension in my tone. "What's up? You okay?"</p>
<p>"What? Oh, yeah, I'm fine." I replied quickly. "It's just that...Well, can I ask you something?"</p>
<p>"Of course, anything."</p>
<p>"It's about you and Duke."</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow and waited.</p>
<p>"Well, I was just wondering what made you two break up in the first place. You seem so comfortable together now, it's like there's nothing wrong, or that there was never anything wrong, and you don't seem sad at all, which confuses me because I thought you really liked him, and he really liked you and it just doesn't make any sense because you still seem so perfect for each other and I feel like a good friend would be trying to figure this stuff out and make sure you're okay, and I really want to be a good friend Vi, especially to you, and I just want to make sure you're over him and that you're really okay and..."</p>
<p>I suddenly became aware that I was rambling terribly and I was also slightly out of breath.</p>
<p>"Wow Liv, that's a lot of words to process really, really quickly." She said. "But from what I actually could pick up from that is you want to know why we broke up and if I'm over him, right?"</p>
<p>I nodded, a bit embarrassed that I couldn't have said it that simply.</p>
<p>But Vi was smiling as she continued. "Well first off you should know that <b>I</b> broke up with <b>him</b>. Second, I broke up with him because we had been such good friends, almost like brothers, that taking it to that level was just a little too weird for both of us. Also," She added quickly. "I kinda liked someone else, and I just couldn't be with him when I cared about the other person so much."</p>
<p><i>Vi has a crush on somebody else? Damn! This could definitely screw up my plans.</i></p>
<p>But Vi wasn't done. "Third, don't worry about it I am totally over him. And fourth, Liv, you're one of the best friends I have ever had. You've always been there for me and I know that I can trust you, and I want you to hear me when I say that I care about you very much."</p>
<p>I could have died from happiness then and there. I put down my empty glass and held out my hand to her.</p>
<p>"Dance with me?"</p>
<p>She smiled, put down her glass, and slid her hand into mine, letting me pull her out onto the dance floor.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Well, I hope that was okay and that you guys are still with me, I promise things will get a little more interesting as the night continues. Also, I think that I'm going to be able to decrease the rating to T, I was reading some M rated stuff and I don't think this will be that bad. BUT DON'T LEAVE! It will still be dirty, I PROMISE! Just not... uncomfortably so. But it will still be girl on girl, so if you're a <b>hater</b> then <b>don't read it</b>!</p>
<p>Until next time, <i><b>PEACE!</b></i></p>
