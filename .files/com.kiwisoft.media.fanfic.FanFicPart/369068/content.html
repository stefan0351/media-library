<p>First off, sorry for the crazy delay in getting this posted. The combination of lack of Internet, writer's block and traveling has been hell on this story apparently. I'm still struggling with the writer's block, but I have every intention to get this finished. As long as there's someone out there to read it ;)</p>
<p>Also, this chapter is rated M...for obvious reasons...</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter VIII</b></p>
<p>Miley awoke in the middle of the night to a completely silent house. Her room was sparsely illuminated by a scary pumpkin nightlight leftover from Halloween, creating long shadows against her walls. A large cat was curled up on each side of the foot end of her new Queen sized bed, graciously warming her normally cold feet. Her grandma was allowing the barn cats to come inside this winter because of the cold and Miley enjoyed their presence in her room and bed. The two tomcats were strangely attached to her and could hardly be found sleeping anywhere but her room, but Miley liked it that way. If she couldn't have her preferred bedmate, the cats would have to do. The last time Lilly had been allowed to sleep over was sometime during Miley's bed-bound days, when both Lilly's parents and her own mother had still felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>She sat up and swung her legs over the side of the bed, the movement earning her matching glares from the sleeping cats. Miley wriggled her toes, trying to gauge the strength of her legs, but since she certainly didn't feel like using her crutches, she stood. Her bedroom was carpeted, but once she got out into the hall the hardwood floor felt cold underneath her bare feet. It was completely silent there, too, with no sounds coming from behind the closed doors of the other two bedrooms.</p>
<p>Miley made her way down the stairs, careful not to make too much noise. Her mother was a light sleeper and seemed to always keep an ear out for Miley doing things she wasn't supposed to. Her legs felt a little stiff and achy without the crutches, but she was happy it no longer hurt to walk. She'd almost completed her four to six week sentence on the crutches and was more than thrilled to be getting rid of them soon.</p>
<p>Her original intent had been to go to the kitchen and maybe raid the fridge for some of the cake they'd had for New Year's, but once she reached the bottom of the staircase she noticed something was off. Miley could tell from where she stood the stove light in the kitchen was on and as she made her way over, she noticed the porch light was lit, as well. A pair of her slippers was strewn by the entrance way and Miley slipped them on before opening the front door. Having grown up in Crowley Corners, she had no worries about burglars or thieves outside and stepped out into the cold winter air.</p>
<p>"Hello, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley almost wished she hadn't woken up at all, but then Richard would've been down here by himself, probably doing something untoward. He was sitting in Grandma Ruby's rocking chair, wearing a thick jacket, holding a steaming mug in his hands. He hadn't even turned to look when the door opened, his eyes staring straight ahead into the darkness as if he saw something no one else could.</p>
<p>"What're you doing out here?" Miley made no pretense of being nice without her mother's watchful gaze.</p>
<p>Richard finally turned to look at her and offered a half smile. "Couldn't sleep. I'm a night owl and I didn't want to wake your mom tossing and turning."</p>
<p>Miley frowned. "How could your tossing and turning wake mom all the way from the sofa?"</p>
<p>Richard shook his head, chuckling. "I like you, Miley; you're a funny kid."</p>
<p>"But I don't like you. You're hiding something and I know it."</p>
<p>Richard's face turned serious again, almost contemplative. "Have you ever lied about something to protect someone you cared about?"</p>
<p>"No. I don't lie," said Miley simply.</p>
<p>He inclined his head, as if to agree. "And that is an admirable quality, Miley. But most of us do lie. We lie to protect people and sometimes we lie because it's just easier, but that doesn't necessarily mean we are hiding something."</p>
<p>"So you <b>are</b> lying then." Miley crossed her arms, but her face remained mostly neutral. She hadn't trusted him from the start; whatever he revealed would be no news to her.</p>
<p>Richard chuckled again. "You've got me all figured out, don't you? Why do you think I'm here, Miley?"</p>
<p>Miley really had no answer for him, beyond just knowing something was off. She shrugged. "I heard you talking on the phone that night, about me and my mom."</p>
<p>"You heard me say your name?" If he was nervous about their conversation, Richard didn't show it. He exuded a calm that was almost eerie to Miley. She shook her head, not able to remember the exact conversation he'd had under her tree. Richard set his mug down on the porch. "I've got a patient who is a star volleyball player at Middle Tennessee. Her coaches are worried she won't be ready for the upcoming season. That's who I was talking about that night, Miley, not you or your mother."</p>
<p>He sounded very confident about his answer and Miley, who had so little experience with people lying, really couldn't tell whether he was. She sighed, frustrated by his presence and the ease with which he seemed to carry himself. If only her Daddy were here, he'd have Richard figured out in no time at all. When Miley didn't say anything, Richard continued.</p>
<p>"Your mom is safe with me, Miley. I am not going to take her away; you have my word."</p>
<p>Miley made a face, certain she didn't believe him this time, even though she desperately wanted to. "But how much is your word worth when you say you sometimes lie?"</p>
<p>Richard looked contemplative at her question and shook his head. "That I can't answer, Miley. But I think you should get back inside; it's freezing out here and you're in your pajamas."</p>
<p>Even though she didn't want to do anything he said, Miley was starting to feel very cold and wanted nothing more than to climb back into bed with the cats. No matter what Richard said, she didn't like him and would not be able to trust him. He effectively ended the conversation by picking his mug back up to take a sip and Miley turned to leave, just wanting to get away. Every time she tried to confront him she felt like she lost. She was just in the doorway, when he called after her.</p>
<p>"There's a piece of cake on the kitchen counter for you. I won't tell your mom if you don't."</p>
<p>Miley hesitated, but went inside without another word. She bypassed the kitchen with the potentially poisoned cake and went straight up to her room. Miley got back into bed, but Richard's parting words would not leave her in peace. He'd sounded almost as if he had known she'd be coming downstairs.</p>
<p><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"Miley, can we <b>please</b> go inside now?" Lilly watched with chattering teeth while her girlfriend continued to pile snow into a sad heap.</p>
<p>"I want to finish my snowman first," said Miley, refusing to be deterred from her task.</p>
<p>Lilly shifted in a futile attempt to force some warmth back into her feet and wrapped her arms tightly around herself. She couldn't fathom how Miley, who was kneeling in the snow wearing nothing but jeans and a sweater, wasn't the least bit cold.</p>
<p>"Looks more like a mush-man to me," she said derisively, wishing she could just go inside.</p>
<p>Miley grinned at the insult, and continued with her task. They'd had the first snowfall that actually stayed on the ground last night and since it had been the same day Dr. Khauf had given Miley the official okay to throw away her crutches, she had seen it as a sign. She was going to build this snowman, no matter how cold her fingers and toes were.</p>
<p>"Come on, Miles, we can make some hot chocolate, and cuddle." Lilly used her last trump card, hoping the lure of getting close to Lilly while Susan was at work would sway the younger girl.</p>
<p>Miley made a face that said Lilly's plan was working. She sighed and swiped her hand across her heap of snow and stood. Lilly suddenly found herself pulled along towards the house, having almost forgotten how fast Miley was when she wasn't injured. They made their way around back to the mudroom to take off their soaked shoes and jackets, though Miley remained dirty and wet.</p>
<p>"I think I need a shower," said Miley matter-of-factly, but the slight smirk tugging at the corner of her lips as she said it gave her away.</p>
<p>Lilly nodded. "I think you do, too. Let me grab the hose."</p>
<p>Miley stuck her tongue out at Lilly and wriggled out of her wet jeans with some difficulty. Next went her soaked shirt and Lilly couldn't help but look. It took her several moments to catch her bearings and she swallowed, almost embarrassed at how dry her mouth was.</p>
<p>"Isn't yourâ€¦uhâ€¦your grandma here?" Lilly struggled with the words, her eyes still focused on her girlfriend's gorgeous body, covered minimally with a bra and panties. She shook her head slowly to force her eyes back to Miley's face.</p>
<p>Miley was grinning, certainly not oblivious to the effect she was having on Lilly. "Nope, she's out. Momma won't be back until ten and Richard's gone all day to Nashville. It's just you and me, Lils."</p>
<p>Lilly narrowed her eyes. "Are you seriously telling me we wasted all this time outside making a retarded snowman?"</p>
<p>Miley laughed, unperturbed and was already walking towards the living room, clad only in her underwear. Lilly followed, unwilling to let the injustice go unpunished, but just when she thought she'd caught up to Miley, the younger girl squealed and ran. Lilly chased her up the stairs, feeling silly for only the briefest of moments, and cornered her girlfriend in the bathroom. She wrapped an arm around Miley's bare waist, pulling the struggling and squealing girl flush against her. It was cold inside the house and Miley's skin was already covered in goosebumps, so Lilly turned on the shower and tried to maneuver her girlfriend into the tub.</p>
<p>Lilly moved to get away, but Miley grabbed her wrist to stop her and slipped, pulling them both down into the tub. Lilly crashed on top of her girlfriend, hearing Miley's head hit the tub with a thud. Warm water rained down on them and she raised herself up enough to brush some water from Miley's face, checking to see if her girlfriend was okay. Miley met her eyes, an impish grin on her face and Lilly could only shake her head, before leaning in to press a wet kiss to the girl's lips. Miley didn't waste any time, both hands gliding along Lilly's skin to peel her wet shirt off of her. Her right hand went to the fly of Lilly's jeans, while the left slid up her back to unhook the blonde's bra.</p>
<p>Lilly almost shot up as Miley's cold hand snaked under her shirt.</p>
<p>"Miles, stop, you're freezing cold," whined Lilly, looking down at her girlfriend. There were some leaves and a bit of dirt stuck to the girl's skin and Lilly had no idea how they had gotten there.</p>
<p>"That's why you need to warm me up," said Miley, her ice-cold fingertips leaving a delicate trail along Lilly's bare skin. Hot water pounded down on them, making her feel warm and cold all at the same time.</p>
<p>Unable to argue with that reasoning, Lilly allowed Miley's hands to wander freely. Feeling at a disadvantage, she brought her hands to the clasp of Miley's bra, taking it off her grinning girlfriend. Most of the dirt and leaves were already washed off, swirling down the drain and Lilly let her hands slide across Miley's slick, hot skin. The panties came off next, hitting the bathroom floor with a wet thud. Lilly pressed her bare, naked skin against Miley's, fire burning through her veins. She leaned closer to press their lips together and their kiss was, as always, soft and tantalizing and all-consuming. Lilly felt Miley's hand slide between their bodies and gasped as the girl's fingers made contact. She broke their kiss as she shuddered, goosebumps erupting across her skin and bit her lip to stifle a moan. Looking down, she saw the smirk on Miley's face and wanted to erase it so badly, but could hardly concentrate with the way Miley was moving against her.</p>
<p>She leaned forward again, bringing her mouth to Miley's ear, biting the girl's sensitive earlobe gently. Lilly felt Miley shudder beneath her and kissed her way down the girl's neck, leaving a trail of soft bites that made her girlfriend groan. She slid her hand along the outside of Miley's thigh, along her belly and back down, teasing her relentlessly. Miley didn't let it up in her rhythm and Lilly closed her eyes against the onslaught, knowing she was close to the edge. She didn't want to go over alone and looked back down, seeing the smirk still firmly in place. Lilly moved her hand farther down and slid her fingers into Miley. The brunette groaned, smirk now gone and Lilly leaned back down to kiss her. Their tongues brushed against each other, mouths pressed firmly together to keep down the moans. They held onto each other tightly as they moved as one and before long they both stiffened as the waves of pleasure descended upon them.</p>
<p>By the time Lilly had recovered enough to open her eyes and push herself up shakily, Miley's eyes were already closed. She laughed lightly, shaking her girlfriend, who seemed to have warmed up considerably. Miley merely groaned, throwing an arm across her face.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna take a nap."</p>
<p>"In the shower? Come on, Roadkill, let's get cleaned up and go cuddle," said Lilly, already reaching for the soap.</p>
<p>Miley snorted, her eyes still covered by her arm and Lilly gave her a look. "What?"</p>
<p>"What we just did was anything but clean, Lils," said Miley, hardly containing her laughter.</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes. She grabbed a bottle of shampoo from the side and pulled the tie out of Miley's hair, before soaping up the girl's head. Maybe she was enabling her girlfriend's laziness and defiance, but how could she resist that gorgeous, naked, wet girl in front of her?</p>
<p>Miley let Lilly shampoo and condition her hair without comment, simply enjoying the ministrations. Once Lilly turned her attentions towards herself, however, Miley grudgingly soaped up and rinsed off in record time, hopping out of the shower to dry off and get dressed. By the time Lilly entered the bedroom, Miley was already stretched out on the bed, opening her arms to beckon Lilly closer.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't hesitate to join her girlfriend on the bed. Miley wrapped her arms around Lilly and pulled the girl down on top of her, leaving the blonde no choice but to press her lips against her girlfriend's. They kissed for several minutes, slow and lovingly, just enjoying each other without the heated frenzy from earlier. Finally Lilly pulled away and slid off Miley, propping herself up on one arm. Miley grinned up at her lazily, sleep just swimming on the edges of her eyes.</p>
<p>Brushing some hair off Miley's forehead, Lilly almost heaved a sigh. "You're too damn cute, Miles. I hate being away from you."</p>
<p>Her own openness surprised her, but she didn't let it show. If there was one person on this earth she could be totally honest with without fear of ridicule or reprisal, it was certainly Miley.</p>
<p>"So, don't go away from me," said Miley simply, capturing Lilly's hand in hers and intertwining their fingers.</p>
<p>"I wish. I was looking forward to Spring Break, until my parents sprung this trip on me." Lilly frowned, unhappy at the slight resentment she felt towards her parents, but also disliking their pushiness as of late.</p>
<p>"Trips are fun. I've never even been outside of Tennessee."</p>
<p>Lilly looked at her girlfriend and made a face. "You can go instead of me then. Being stuck in a car with my parents while we drive to Florida and up the coast to North Carolina sounds like pure torture to me."</p>
<p>"I like your parents," said Miley, voice almost contemplative and Lilly realized she must be thinking about her own father, who would never be able to take her on a trip and she sighed.</p>
<p>"I like them, too, Miles. But they've been forcing this college thing on me for months and making me drive around half the country to look at schools I don't want to go to is only gonna make me more annoyed."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Aren't they good schools, though?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, some of them. But Middle Tennessee isn't bad and it's got one thing no other school does."</p>
<p>"What's that?" asked Miley, though the smirk waiting to break free betrayed her innocence.</p>
<p>Lilly leaned closer until their lips almost met. "You," she breathed and closed the distance between them, hoping to convey every ounce of love and devotion she felt in that one kiss. She pulled away, both of them breathless from the intensity of their emotions.</p>
<p>Miley grinned. "We've got a few weeks. We should make the most of that time."</p>
<p>"We should," agreed Lilly, leaning in again. She was going to prove to Miley she loved her beyond measure, that even if for some reason she ended up going somewhere else, it didn't mean she wasn't head over heels in love.</p>
