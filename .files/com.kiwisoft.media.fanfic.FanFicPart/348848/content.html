<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 6 - Winds of Change-->

<P>As the darkness of night engulfed Lt. Torres and Seven of Nine, a cool breeze
began to blow in from the north-east. At first it was a small and barely
noticeable, but as the minutes passed, the wind got stronger. B'Elanna wrapped
her arms around her body and began to shiver slightly. "Wow, it's getting pretty
cold all of a sudden." B'Elanna looked at Seven who sat beside her. "Well, I
guess it doesn't matter to you, after all you're Borg and you can stand the cold
unlike me." B'Elanna wrapped her arms tighter and began to rub her arms to keep
warm. </P>
<P>Seven looked slightly concerned. "You are correct Lt. Torres, my Borg
implants allow me to regulate temperature more efficiently than Humans or
Klingons." Seven reached out her left hand and placed it on B'Elanna's right
shoulder. "You are shaking Lt. Torres." </P>
<P>B'Elanna slipped her shoulder out of Seven's grasp. "It's nothing, really.
I'm just cold, I'll be alright in the morning. I just need some sleep." B'Elanna
had begun to lie down, when a hand grabbed her right arm. Seven moved closer to
B'Elanna and within seconds she had her arms wrapped around the Chief Engineer.
</P>
<P>"What are doing Seven?" B'Elanna was shocked by the turn of events and tried
to free herself from the Borg's hold. Seven's breasts were snugly pressed
against B'Elanna's right side. "I am attempting to keep your body at 40 degrees
Celsius. If your body falls below that you will eventually suffer from
hypothermia. My body heat will provide you with enough warmth until morning."
Seven continued to tightly hold onto Lt. Torres. </P>
<P>B'Elanna tried in vain to free herself. "I don't think a little cold is gonna
kill me Seven, now let go." Seven simply stated, "That would not be a in our
best interest, as the temperature has fallen dramatically over the past half
hour." Seven's face had moved closer to B'Elanna's, and the Chief Engineer was
beginning to feel real uncomfortable. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart was racing and she was getting red in the face. She knew
that Seven was right, but it didn't mean that she had to like it. "Okay fine you
win, but this conversation never happened. In fact this whole situation never
happened, got it?" B'Elanna turned to look Seven in the eyes and was surprised
that she ended up almost nose to nose with the blonde Borg.</P>
<P>Seven was very familiar with this demand, as she had heard it from Captain
Janeway on a number of occasions. So she said yes, hoping that B'Elanna would
stop trying to get free. Sure enough Lt. Torres stopped fighting and began to
slowly relax. B'Elanna put her head down not wanting to look into those
captivating blue eyes anymore. B'Elanna thought she had felt something when she
saw Seven looking back at her with genuine concern, but she told herself that
the cold was just getting to her.</P>
<P>B'Elanna began rubbing her arms again, only Seven's arms were in the way and
she ended up rubbing Seven's arms instead. Embarrassed by what she had done, she
stopped immediately. Seven noticed this and took her arms out around of
B'Elanna's waist and began to rub her arms for her. Surprisingly B'Elanna
didnâ€™t' object, she simply stayed there silent, with her arms wrapped around
herself, while Seven slowly warmed her up. </P>
<P>Seven decided to change positions and moved behind B'Elanna. She pressed her
breasts against B'Elanna's back and began to once again rub B'Elanna's arms.
Seven's legs were on either side of B'Elanna as she wanted to maximize the
amount of body heat B'Elanna received. They stayed this way for another hour,
B'Elanna sitting with her arms around herself, head down, and Seven keeping her
warm. </P>
<P>Unexpectedly, B'Elanna spoke up. "Seven?" She whispered. Seven was brought
out of her dream-like state. "Yes?" She was surprised to hear B'Elanna speak.
</P>
<P>"Thank you." B'Elanna said with sincerity ringing through her voice. </P>
<P>"You are welcome." Seven responded, hoping that B'Elanna could tell how much
she meant it. With that, they continued on like before. Seven returned to her
dream-like state as she massaged B'Elanna's arms, eyes closed, enjoying every
moment of it. </P>
