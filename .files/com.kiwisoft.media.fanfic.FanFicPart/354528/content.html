<!-- Realms \ Part 9 -->

<p>Buffy and Willow walked hand in hand alongside the babbling brook as
the Goddess spoke, "Warrior of light tell me do you know how to use
your mind as a weapon."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure what you mean?"</p>

<p>"I feared you might answer in that manner.  You see child  the
increased strength and speed are only a portion of your abilities,
you have already used your mind as it was intended but did not
realize it."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped walking and stared at the Goddess, "Do you mean like
when I threw the vampires backwards without touching them?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean.  Your mind is unlike that of any other
slayer, when focused properly it can be just as deadly a weapon as
your fighting skills.  With it you will be able to manipulate the
energies that surround you.  Throwing vampires is just one of many
ways you can do this.  You have it in your ability now to use the
energies around you as a weapon.  They can be used just effectively
as a punch or a fist when fighting and if focused right be just as
deadly as a sword."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to do that, I'm not even sure how I threw those
vampires."</p>

<p>The Goddess moved swiftly over to Buffy and took the slayers chin in
her hand, "Look into my eyes and I will show you."</p>

<p>Willow rested her head on Buffy's shoulder as her lover stood in a
trance before the Goddess and waited for Buffy to come back to her.
After a few moments the slayer broke out of her trance, and tilted
her head towards Willow, "I'm back."</p>

<p>Willow took her head of Buffy's shoulder and softly kissed her on the
lips, "I see."</p>

<p>Buffy turned her attention away from Willow for a moment and looked
towards the Goddess, "I understand now, can we go now," inquired
Buffy who was wanting more than anything to finish the kiss Willow
had started in the privacy of their own room.</p>

<p>The Goddess smiled at the two young women, "I know that you wish to
be alone with your beloved Warrior of light, but there is still much
to accomplish."</p>

<p>The Goddess turned to Willow, "Tell me young mage, do you know what
it is that you are?"</p>

<p>Buffy wasn't sure if she liked where this conversation was going so
to be on the safe side she protectively wrapped her arms around
Willow, which caused the Goddess to chuckle, "Warrior of light I
assure you I mean no harm to your beloved."</p>

<p>Willow slightly blushed when she realized what had just taken place
and calmly reassured her soul mate, "It's OK Buffy, we are in the
presents of the Goddess, we're safe here."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at the slayer then turned to the Goddess, "I'm not sure
if I understand your question, I am pretty sure I know who I am, but
I don't know why everyone keeps calling me a mage, I am only a humble
Wicca."</p>

<p>"No child you are a mage, the immortal that Morgan le Fey sent form
the Middle Ethereal was helping you unlock your true magical nature,
however with the appearance of the warlock their is no longer time to
allow your abilities to develop naturally."</p>

<p>The goddess reached out her hand which was emanating a soft white
light and gently placed it on Willows forehead, "Young mage look to
your self and see what it is that you truly are."</p>

<p>Angel sat at Giles table with from Xander, Anya, and Tara, "Could you
please tell me again where Buffy and Willow are,: inquired the
brooding vamp wanting to make sure he heard the blonde girl correctly.</p>

<p>"They are with the Goddess learning the nature of their abilities and
how to use them," replied Tara.</p>

<p>Angel scratched his head, "Would you care to elaborate a little."</p>

<p>"You said when you first got her that the oracles told you to talk to
the ultimate slayer and the mage, am I correct."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what has that got to do with Buffy and Willow," asked a
frustrated Angel as Xander and Anya both nodded their heads in
agreement.</p>

<p>Tara grinned in amusement at the others, "It has everything to do
with them, they are the once you seek.  Buffy has found her soul mate
and become the ultimate slayer, the Warrior of light.  As for Willow
she is the mage that the oracles spoke of."</p>

<p>Tara took a deep breath before continuing, "The sudden appearance of
the warlock and the threat he posses to outer earth required that The
Powers That Be speed up things so they brought the two of them to the
upper Ethereal to teach of their powers."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I am Laoise, Lord of Demons.  Why have you awakened me?"</p>

<p>"I am Ciarán, of the temple of Tursa.  I seek an alliance to enable
me to access the power of the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"Why should I help you gain more power warlock, how would it benefit
me."</p>

<p>"Once I have tapped the power of the Hellmouth I will be able to open
it allowing you passage to outer earth, I only ask in return a
position of power in your regime once you have outer earth."</p>

<p>"What else will this alliance require of me warlock?"</p>

<p>"I need you to keep the mages and sentinels of the void occupied long
enough more me to gain access to the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>The red smoke engulfed Ciarán lifting him off the ground, "So shall
it be, Ciarán of the temple of Tursa you now are of my house, do not
fail to keep your end of the bargain, now go and do what you must to
prepare, I shall contact you when the time to strike is at hand."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara had just finished explaining the nature of the realms to the
group for the sixth time when Buffy and Willow appeared in the center
of the room.</p>

<p>Xander hopped up out of his seat, "Hey your back, come join the
party."</p>

<p>"Not now Xander, we have to get to the cabins on the edge of town
before all is lost," snapped Buffy.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I don't have time to explain are you guys coming or not."</p>

<p>
Buffy and Willow cautiously made their way towards the towards the
front door of the cabin the Goddess had told them to go to as Angel,
Xander and Tara made their way towards the rear entrance of the cabin.</p>

<p>Ciarán smiled, unaware that they were being watched from outside, as
Ethan brought Giles and Joyce into the room in handcuffs.  He pulled
a dagger from his cloak and dropped it to the ground.  Then with a
wave of his hand it floated up in the air in front of him with the
blade pointed directly at Giles, "Farwell Rupert," replied Ciarán as
he sent the blade screaming though the air at the watcher.</p>

<p>Ciarán screamed out in anger as the blade stopped inches from his
victims heart before dropping to the ground.  He heard a feminine
voice from behind him speak, "Not today warlock."</p>

<p>Ciarán spun around just in time to be sent flying through the air by
Buffy's round house.  The warlock picked himself up off the ground,
and snarled, "I'll teach you to mess with me little girl."</p>

<p>"Don't you even think of hurting her," shouted Willow form the
doorway as she sent a bolt of energy through the air striking the
warlock in the chest.  </p>

<p>Ciarán looked at Buffy then Willow, "I don't know who you are or how
you did that but soon your going to regret the day that our paths
crossed."  He then folded his arms accrosed his chest, lowered his
head, and vanished into thin air.
Willow ran over next to Buffy, "I suggest you let them go."</p>

<p>Ethan quickly yanked a 9MM from his belt and pressed the barrel
against Giles for head, "So the other slayer and the witch have
decided to show themselves, well you might be good enough to stop a
dagger but I seriously doubt either one of you could stop a bullet
from killing your watcher in time. Now back off."</p>

<p>Suddenly Ethan's hand was grabbed from behind with such force that
every finger bone in it was crushed causing him to drop the loaded
weapon to the ground, "I'm not going to let that happen," replied
Angel.</p>
