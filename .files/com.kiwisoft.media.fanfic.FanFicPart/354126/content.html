<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 40: "The End of The Affair" -->

<p>The silence in the room was deafening.  Sam was aware of every whir,
and thump, and tick in the house as she went about unloading her
essentials into the guest room.  Her mother was on the other side of
the room fixing the other bed.  They had been in there for almost
fifteen minutes and hadn't spoken a word to each other.  The most
contact they had had was Jane looking up at her when she entered the
room and then pointing towards where Sam could deposit her things.
Sam stopped what she was doing and looked across the room at her
mothers back.  Since the family chat in the afternoon, things in the
house had been kind of surreal.  The elders had spent most of their
time upstairs discussing god knows what about the situation, and she
and Brooke had kind of wandered around the downstairs in a stupefied
haze.  It was like they had been living in a bubble for the past
three hours.  Looking at her mom, and hearing only stony silence, Sam
knew the bubble had burst.  They were all now painfully aware of the
reality of the situation.</p>

<p>"Mom," Sam said, unable to take the silence anymore.  Jane turned to
look at her, her face unreadable.  She was pale and the muscles in
her face were tightly drawn.  "Where should I put my socks?" Sam
asked off-put by the unhinged look on her mothers face.  She had
planned on saying something meaningful, and significant, but she
panicked.</p>

<p>"In the sock drawer Sam," Jane responded tiredly.  Sam nodded
vigorously, the sock drawer, of course, and turned towards the sock
drawer.  Well, she thought to herself, that went well.  Picking up
her socks, she began to fold them.  Suddenly folding her socks was of
the utmost importance.  With the attention she was paying to folding
her socks, one would have thought those socks could one day be the
cure for cancer.</p>

<p>Jane watched Sam folding those socks, studied her intensely, her
stomach clenching and unclenching painfully as the reality of their
situation clubbed her over the head in a psychotic circle.  "Do you
have everything you need?" Jane asked finally.  Talking tended to
distract her, and she was getting very tired of thinking.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded, hesitatingly halting her sock
folding.  "Everything I need is here," she continued fiddling with
the sock she held in her hand nervously.  She was lying of course,
there were many things that she needed that weren't there.  One being
her spine, but the most significant being Brooke.</p>

<p>Jane nodded, her eyes drifting to the little table that Sam had set
up to but her personal effects on.  There were a few pictures of
herself with Carmen, Lily and Harrison, the ever present picture of
her father,  and another one that hadn't been part of her set up
before.  It was of a little girl, and was resting against a flower
vase.  Jane stared at it for a moment in confusion until she realized
that the little girl in the picture was Brooke.  She remembered
seeing the same photograph in an album Mike had shown her one time.
It was in the She-Ra section.  Still looking at the picture, she
realized that the rose in the vase holding the picture up also must
have come from Brooke.  She turned her attention back to making the
bed, something about the familiarity — or if she was perfectly honest
with herself, the tenderness — of the display forcing her to look
away.</p>

<p>"Are we going to talk about this?" Sam blurted out moments after her
mother turned from studying the picture.  There was a confrontational
edge to her voice, an irritation that she hadn't meant to project,
but there it was.  And it was honest, she realized, it was there
because that's how she felt.  She had seen her mother looking at the
picture of Brooke, she had seen the emotions float across her
features, and she had seen her deny the meaning of the picture by
turning away.  The truth was that she didn't know what was going
through their heads, she didn't know if they thought that she and
Brooke were just in it for the sex or what.  She didn't know because
they hadn't talked about it.  She was in love with Brooke, and if she
was going to go down, she wanted that to be known at least.  She
wanted them to know that it was more than just fucking, it was love.</p>

<p>Jane turned around once again, meeting her daughters eyes.  There was
a strength in them, an assertiveness that she hadn't seen only
moments before.  "To tell you the truth Sam, I don't even know where
to begin," Jane responded finally.  Her voice was heavily, like her
body felt.  It was an effort for her to remain standing, the
weariness she felt seeping into bones, into her marrow.</p>

<p>"Just ask," Sam replied in a softer tone, watching her mother
carefully.  She wasn't really sure what she was watching for, or if
she would recognize it when she saw it, only that watching her seemed
to be a good idea.</p>

<p>Jane was silent for a while after Sam spoke.  She had brought her
hand up to her face and was tugging on her ear viciously.  She sat
down on the bed, then stood back up, then sat down on the bed again,
all the while tugging on her ear and closing and opening her eyes.
Sam could practically feel the tension rolling off of her.  She got
the distinct impression that the calm was gone, and the storm had
arrived.</p>

<p>"What were you thinking!?!" Jane asked finally, standing up once
more.  Her voice was loud, a yell even, her tone critical, and
confused and horrified.  "Are you stupid!?!  Is that it?  Did I drop
you at some point during your childhood and forget about it?  What
were you thinking!?!" she continued almost manically.</p>

<p>"I wasn't," Sam stuttered.  She had expected something like that but
at the same time she hadn't been prepared for it.  She could count
the number of times she had heard her mother raise her voice to her
on one hand without doubling.  As a result she had never gotten quite
used to it.  This time was different from those other few times
however, this time there was something more to it, though what that
more was Sam couldn't quite identify.  "I mean…it just…I couldn't
help it, it just happened," she continued still off-kilter.</p>

<p>"It just happened," Jane muttered under her breath incredulously, a
darkly amused looked coming over her face, a homicidal hilarity
coating her tone.  "What? She bent down to tie her shoe and you fell
into her?" she continued her voice raising sharply once
more.  "Spontaneous combustion just happens, sleeping with your step-
sister doesn't just happen!  Lying to me, and sneaking around behind
my back doesn't just happen!"</p>

<p>The hostility in her mothers voice was enough to snap Sam out of the
momentary daze she had gone into, and stepping forward she responded
to her mother with as much passion as she had been spoken to with.</p>

<p>"But it does," Sam started.  "That's exactly what happened.  It was
spontaneous combustion.  I'm sorry I lied, and that we sneaked
around, but I don't think that you can pretend to be shocked that we
did.  I mean, I liked MY room," Sam went on still not able to move
past the repossession of her room.  It came down the fact that she
had to say her piece, whether she said it now or later, it wasn't
going to be easy, and it wasn't going to be fun, but it had to be
done.  The damage had been done, and honesty was now the only way to
control it.  </p>

<p>"You might not want to hear this, in fact I'm certain that you don't
and that you won't believe me anyway … but I love her.  Sincerely,
fully.  That's what just happened.  It's like she set a fire inside
of my heart," she continued her voice cracking.  Her tone had gotten
softer as she spoke, more reverent and resonant.  "I mean, come on.
Do you really think that I would have chosen Brooke of all people if
I had had a choice.  Brooke who I've hated with a passion so intense
it has no name since I came out of the womb?" Her voice was as
incredulous as her mothers had been earlier when she asked this.  She
knew that both her mom and Mr. McQueen had been very aware of their
previous hatred of each other, and thought that a reminder would
help.  "Come on mom!  We didn't do this to screw you over.  We didn't
do this to be trendy, or to rebel against `the man'," Sam went
on.  "We just couldn't not.  We just didn't have a choice….I just
love her more than I can express in words, and, well, this happened,"
she finished flinging her hands up in the air with a flourish.  </p>

<p>Jane sat back down on the bed, with what Sam would characterize as a
pout on her face.  There she sat, brooding and ruminating, and
contemplating for a few moments before looking back over at her
daughter.  </p>

<p>"What am I…we suppose to do about this, huh?" Jane asked finally.
There was a note of helplessness and desperation in her voice.  Like
she was actually looking for suggestions.  </p>

<p>"Nothing," Sam responded.  As long as her mom was asking her opinion
she could as well give it.  "Short of sending one of us to another
country.  I'm in love with her, and I can't stop that anymore than I
could stop breathing," she continued, blinking back tears.</p>

<p>Jane observed her daughter thoughtfully for a moment, watching as she
tried to retain control over her emotions, considering for a time
what had happened.  Her eyes drifted back over the picture and the
flower, a reflective expression coming over her face.  She continued
to look at it for a moment more, then stood up and sighed before
saying, "Finish folding your socks."  </p>

<p>With that she stood up and walked out of the room leaving Sam to her
thoughts, and her tears.</p>
