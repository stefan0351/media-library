<!-- A Little Birdie Told Me So \ Part 1 -->

<p>Buffy stalked
into the café and looked around. Willow wasn't there. She sighed and ran a
hand through her hair straightening it out. She wasn't sure whether she was
glad Willow hadn't arrived yet so that she could gather her wits, or whether
she was sad that she would have to wait to see her friend. Glancing around
the café she spotted an empty booth behind a group of teens and took a seat.
Whether she liked it or not it she was waiting.</p>

<p>She had just gotten
through with patrol and had come straight to the café. She and Willow had
agreed to meet here when she was done. It wasn't for any special reason,
they just both wanted to get out of the dorm room for a reason that didn't
involve demons and death. She was glad that they had agreed to meet because
the slaying that hadn't been so great-or perhaps it had been too good-and
she was really looking forward to seeing Willow and just doing something
normal. Something relaxing. Nothing could put her in a better mood faster
than being with Willow.</p>

<p>One of the voices at the table behind her caught
her attention. She recognized the voice. It was smoky, and deep but
distinctly feminine. Then after a moment she was able to place it , it
belonged to a girl that she had two classes with.Claire. They were in
psychology and geography together. Buffy had never really talked to her, but
her voice was original and made her stand out so the Slayer had noticed
her.</p>

<p>Even though she recognized the voice, Buffy wasn't notoriously
concerned with the conversation taking place behind her and kept her eyes on
the door, waiting for Willow. It wasn't until she heard her name mentioned
at the table behind her that started to listen to what they were
saying.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers?" It was Claire who asked that. She seemed
slightly amused. Buffy wasn't sure how she felt about that.</p>

<p>"Yeah,
she's a hottie," a male voice responded. "A stone cold fox," he continued.
Buffy could almost hear the smile in his voice. She knew that she should be
upset about being objectified, that's what any good feminist would feel, but
she didn't really mind. Being called a stone cold fox wasn't so
bad.</p>

<p>"You're way off man," another voice responded. This one was male
too. "That girl's.she's like this deep well.you could fall into her," he
 continued.</p>

<p>"Who's Buffy Summers? Is she a model? I've never heard of
her.is she that new girl of Party of Five?" This time the voice was female,
and very valley girl. She reminded Buffy of Cordelia. Although she would
never admit it to anyone Buffy had to admit that she missed Cordelia a
little bit. Despite that fact that she could be an absolute bitch when she
wanted to be, there was something charming about the brunette. It was kind
of irritating.</p>

<p>"Buffy is not the new girl on Party of Five," Claire
responded. The tone of her voice was hilarious and Buffy wished that she
could see her face. "She's that blonde chick who's in 'the demon bitch
monster from hells' class with us."</p>

<p>"This is California, do you know
how many blonde chicks there are around here?" the other female asked. "This
table is ¾ blond."</p>

<p>"Is that your way of telling me you want me to be more
specific?" Claire asked. Buffy could hear the two males
snicker.</p>

<p>"Yes," the other female responded in a snippy
tone.</p>

<p>"Buffy is the blond chick who's permanently attached to the side of
that red-headed chick," Claire responded. Buffy arched her eyebrow at the
 description. That was a first.</p>

<p>"Oohhhhhh," the other female said in a
knowing tone. Buffy was tempted to turn around, what the hell was 'oohhhhhh'
suppose to mean?</p>

<p>"What the hell is that suppose to mean?" the first male
Buffy had heard speak asked. &lt;Right on brother&gt;, Buffy thought to
herself.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Claire responded. "We just don't think that you're
her type," she continued. &lt;Why not?&gt;, Buffy thought to
herself.</p>

<p>"Why not?" the guy asked in a kind of pathetic
tone.</p>

<p>"Well first of all, have you seen her shoes? The girl has got
taste," the unknown female responded.</p>

<p>"Which means that she'd never
go out with you," Claire finished. Despite herself Buffy found that slightly
amusing.and she did have good shoes.</p>

<p>"What's the second reason?" the
second guy asked.</p>

<p>"The girl's an LSL," Claire responded in an exasperated
tone. "It's so obvious." &lt;A what?&gt;, Buffy thought to herself. She
hated acronyms, she really did. First it was her mother with that stupid
MOO, and now this. What the hell was an LSL?</p>

<p>"Lip-Stick Lesbian," the
other girl responded happily. "Your sister's good looking though, maybe you
could introduce them," she continued laughing at her own wit.</p>

<p>Time
seemed to slow down for Buffy after the acronym was explained. Lip-Stick
Lesbian. Buffy shock her head in confusion. Why would they think that she
was gay? There was nothing wrong with it, she just didn't understand why
they thought that she was. &lt;Do I give off a gay vibe?&gt; she wondered.
Faith had always teased her about that.</p>

<p>"She is not," the first guy
responded. "You're just jealous," he stated.</p>

<p>"Yeah, of the red-head," the
first girl responded. "What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Willow," Claire responded. "You
could always fight for the fair Ms. Summer's affections, but if you ask me,
she could take you."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Jeff, Annie could definitely kick your
scrawny ass," the other girl added.</p>

<p>"Shut up Abbie," Jeff, the first
guy, responded.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor baby," Claire responded. "I'm sure there are a
lot of pretty girls out there just dying to date you, who wouldn't rather do
your sister."</p>

<p>"Are you sure about her?" the second guy
asked.</p>

<p>"T.J, I'm telling you this girl is as queer as black sunshine,"
Abbie responded. "But even if she did swing both ways, I doubt you or anyone
else would have a chance with her."</p>

<p>"Why?" Jeff asked. He sounded
like a two year old who had been told he couldn't have a cookie.</p>

<p>"She
and the red-head."</p>

<p>"Willow."</p>

<p>"Yeah, whatever. Like I was saying,
they seem really tight. Dopey Bambi eyes and shit," Abbie said. "I bet
they're like in love or something."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Buffy and Willow sitting in a
tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g." Claire sing-songed.</p>

<p>"Hey, that's it!" T.J said
as if he had just discovered a cure for cancer.</p>

<p>"That's what?" Claire
asked.</p>

<p>"That's why they're always holding hands, and like skipping down
the road together and shit," he responded.</p>

<p>Buffy was sure that they
continued to talk about her and Willow after that but she stopped paying
attention to what they were saying after that. They thought that she was
gay.with Willow. They thought that she and Willow were being gay together.
That was totally, way, way, way, utterly, completely.not so off base, Buffy
admitted. They weren't together like that, but Buffy had thought about what
it would be like if they were, and they were close. 'I bet they're like in
love or something' Abbie had said. Buffy's mind kept repeating that sentence
over and over again in her head like the proverbial broken record. They
loved each other, that much Buffy knew for they had told each. She just
hadn't realized that it was so obvious to those around them.</p>

<p>Buffy
frowned and played with the ring on her thumb. She wasn't really upset about
what they had been saying about her, after all they hadn't said anything
mean or even judgmental. She supposed that she would have been upset about
though if it wasn't for the fact that they right about her feeling for
Willow. She wouldn't go as far as to call herself a lip-stick lesbian or
queer as black sunshine, but she definitely had more than friendly feelings
for her best friend that were very gay in origin.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Willow walked
into the café and looked around. At first she couldn't see Buffy because a
large crowd was getting up and blocking Buffy from her view, but once they
started to move towards the door she spotted her friend. Willow recognized
two of the people in the crowd from her psychology class. She hadn't really
spoken to them, and only knew one of their names, but they seemed like
decent individuals. As they passed each other the group gave Willow an odd
look before moving by her and out the door. Willow stopped and watched them
leave wondering what the 'children of the corn' look was for. Shrugging she
turned back around and headed for the booth Buffy was in. The Slayer didn't
seem to have spotted her yet.</p>

<p>Willow sat down opposite Buffy and still
the Slayer didn't look at her. It was as if she didn't even know she was
there. She was that lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Willow said softly placing
her hand over her friends.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes immediately shot up to hers. The
Slayer seemed surprised, distracted, and a little bit unsettled. Willow's
brows drew together in concern, something wasn't right here.</p>

<p>"Are you
okay?" Willow asked looked at Buffy critically. "You look kind of.kind of
weird."</p>

<p>"I'm not weird," Buffy said drawing her hands away from
underneath Willow's. "I'm perfectly normal. Not at all like Revlon, or black
sunshine. Perfectly normal."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean.I know you're normal,"
Willow responded quickly in reaction to Buffy's reaction. "You're not weird,
you're great.normal and great. You're just a little.pale," Willow said
finally settling on an adjective.</p>

<p>"Pale?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Just a
little," Willow responded. "What's wrong Buffy?"</p>

<p>Buffy didn't respond
right away, instead she kind of turned her head to the side to look behind
her before turning back to Willow. They were gone.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of
here," Buffy said suddenly.</p>

<p>"What? Why?" Willow asked startled. "I just
got here."</p>

<p>"And am glad that you did. Thrilled really, ecstatic," Buffy
responded. "But we should leave. Yeah, we should definitely
leave."</p>

<p>"Why?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Why can't we just go?" Buffy asked
turning to look at Willow sharply. She regretted it the moment she said it
and lowered her gaze. Finally she looked back up to meet Willow's hurt gaze
and sighed. "I'm sorry Will," she said softly reaching out to take Willow's
hand. "I didn't mean to go all 'grrr' at you," she continued. "I just.this
place is giving me the wiggins right now. It'd be better for my nerves, not
to mention my mood if we shut her down."</p>

<p>"If you want to shut, then
we'll shut," Willow responded squeezing Buffy's hand. "But if you think that
we're not going to talk about this later, then you are wrong, wrong, wrong,
lady."</p>

<p>"Consider me properly chastised," Buffy responded with her most
charming grin.</p>

<p>"Good," Willow responded as they headed out of the
café. "Now you better continue to behave, or I'll have to spank
you."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped walking.</p>

<p>"Will," she said in what she hoped
was a normal voice. "You've spent way to much time around
Xander."</p>

<p>Willow smiled that sweet, lovely smile that Buffy loved so much
and continued
walking.</p>
