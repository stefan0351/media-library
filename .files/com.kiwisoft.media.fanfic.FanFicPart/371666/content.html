<p style="text-align:center;"><i><u>What I didn't know</u></i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Chapter 3: Algún Día<br>
</i><i>(Someday) </i></p>
<p>I knew that taking it with me was a bad idea. I should have left it laying within that enormous pile of clothes back at Lily's room. She would have never thought it fell there thanks to me and everything would have kept on as if I had never read anything. But no, I had to complicate things.</p>
<p>I am right now in my room, staring at the ceiling. I know I shouldn't go back into reading but I need to. Something tells me those are not the only two poems she wrote for that mysterious girl, and I also want to know which of her best friend she is talking about.</p>
<p>I don't know why I'm so interested, but I am. Not everything need to be explained, right?</p>
<p>I raise my left hand over to my night table, where I have left Lily's notebook, and regain it. Sitting in my bed, I accommodate my pillow behind my back pressing it against the bed's headboard, and reach to my right to turn on the lamp. Then I opened the book where I left it before. I already checked the previous pages and it had nothing of relevance to the confusing subject, so I continued through the few pages left. It seems her crush has not been born long ago, if the placement of these poems had anything to say about it.</p>
<p>Right after that last poem I read earlier today was the next poem of my interest. It was named "Algún Día", in Spanish that means "Someday". Oh hey, I remember this one. It was the poem Lily presented on Literature day in Spanish class this last semester. The teacher had loved it, and I did too; as soon as Lily translated it for me that is.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"Algun Dia"<br>
<i>(<u>Someday</u>)</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Te quiero escribir un poema<br>
Que tenga por tema<br>
Tu hermoso ser<br>
El que te niegas a ver.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(I want to write you a poem<br>
</i><i>That has as title<br>
</i><i>Your beautiful self<br>
</i><i>The one you deny to see).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">No soy la mejor en esto<br>
Pero a veces me presto<br>
Para escribir lo que del alma sale<br>
Y averiguar si de algo vale.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(I am not the best in this<br>
</i><i>But sometimes I lend myself<br>
</i><i>To write what comes from the soul<br>
</i><i>And find out if it's worth something).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Quisiera decirte tantas cosas<br>
En versos y en prosa<br>
Pero mantengo el silencio<br>
Por miedo al desprecio.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(I want to tell you so many things<br>
</i><i>In verse and in prose<br>
</i><i>But I keep silence<br>
</i><i>For fear of rejection).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Se que no es el momento<br>
Pero me mantendre atento<br>
Puede que algún día aparezca<br>
La oportunidad de tenerte cerca.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(I know it's not the time<br>
</i><i>But I'll keep attentive<br>
</i><i>Could be that someday appears<br>
</i><i>The opportunity to have you close).</i></p>
<p>Yes, it is exactly that one. Back then I had asked her who she wrote it to, because it the poem seemed to hold such strength behind each of its words. She didn't answer me, not directly at least. She merely said that I would know if it ever came to be.</p>
<p>I turn the page.</p>
<p><i>I had written this a while ago, yet I never wrote anything on its back. I have something to right now though. Today, she asked me who I wrote this for. I wanted to answer her; no in reality no, I didn't. What for? It is a waste of many things, one of them time. </i></p>
<p><i>Still, there's no denying it. Not anymore. I am in love with my best, female, friend. No doubt about it.</i></p>
<p><i>On a happier note! This poem helped me on Spanish class! I had forgotten about the poem due today and so I re-wrote this one. It's a good thing I read these special poems so much, otherwise my mother would have hung me had I miss another assignment. </i></p>
<p>To tell you I was shocked was an understatement. I was plainly glued to my bed with my eyes frozen on her words. Could it be? That I am the one who Lily is in love with? Could it be me who owns Lily's heart and didn't even know it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">To be continued…</p>
<p><b>A/N: </b><b>Tan tan tan taaaan! </b><b>What will Miley do now? How does she feel about this? Will she be disgusted? Or will she welcome Lily's love with open arms? You'll have to wait for the next chapter (which I still haven't written) to find out! </b></p>
<p><b>Anyway, I know this is much shorter than the previous ones, but I wrote these three chapters in the same night and although they aren't much I was beginning to get tired. </b></p>
<p><b>But! Don't forget to tell me what you think in a review! :) </b></p>
