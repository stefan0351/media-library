<p>A/N: (Crawls from under a rock) Hey. Hope everyone hasn't forgotten this little piece yet. My badness for tardiness. Here's some compensation. (Crawls back under rock)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Viola, dressed in plaid and sneakers, apprehensively walked under the big banner labeled "Stratford Junior League Carnival" along with teammates Duke, Toby and Andrew.</p>
<p><i>'I'm in hell, I'm in hell...</i>' she thought to herself as Toby threatened to cut someone. The chances of discovery in this place were at an all time high. A trickle of sweat traveled down the back of her neck at the thought of being confronted by her mother of even Justin while dressed as Sebastian. There was also the possibility of running into these guys while dressed as a girl. It wouldn't be pretty.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I never really liked carnivals." she said out loud.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Olivia was crossing the path in front of her, winking and saying suggestively "Hey, I'm working the kissing booth. Come see me." that Viola was knocked out of her panic. Confusion took its place instead. She watched the blond walk away with a bewildered yet intrigued expression on her face, shifting her backpack which contained a dress uncertainly on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Didn't you two break up?" Duke asked his roommate with a frown, having spotted the flirty look. Viola was totally caught off-guard by the question.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, you know... The ladies want the whole cheese after a taste, ya know what I'm saying, bro?" Viola raised her fist for a pound.</p>
<p>"... Cheese?" Duke looked amused by her choice of words. Viola lowered her fist awkwardly and shrugged.</p>
<p>"The Big Cheese on campus, home slice! Which is me. Try to keep up, will you?" Viola waved her hand at him and Duke rolled his eyes at his roommate's weird antics. He stared longingly in the direction Olivia had walked off in and shrugged in a 'what the hell?' gesture before heading in that direction.</p>
<p>"Hey, Duke, where are you going?" Viola questioned as Duke strode off.</p>
<p>"Where do you think?" he responded. Viola realized with a twinge of jealousy that he was heading to the kissing booth. Though, the time to take action slipped from her grasp the moment she spotted Monique, her supposed 'psycho-ex'.</p>
<p>"Uh-oh." she said while turning around and almost running into Toby and Andrew.</p>
<p>"Whats up?" Andrew asked.</p>
<p>"Uh, nothing, you know. Just spotted my psycho-ex, so I don't really wanna deal with her so if you guys don't mind, I'm going to lay low for a while." Viola explained quickly as she started a fast walk away.</p>
<p>"Okay, catch up with you later!"</p>
<p>"Okay!" she called out over her shoulder. She sighed annoyingly at the whole situation. She just knew this was marking the beginning of a very long day.</p>
<p><i>'I'm in hell, I'm in hell...</i>' Olivia thought to herself as yet another disgusting-ugly-loser-dork-guy who was probably giving her his first kiss stepped up to the plate. There was just something not right about the whole 'selling your lips' deal while studying to become a proper lady for crying out loud! The first few times she had tried to imagine she was kissing Viola, but she just couldn't do it anymore because she couldn't imagine Viola was such a bad kisser. So she puckered up and endured, secretly hoping Viola would come to relieve her shift or at least take her up on her offer as Sebastian.</p>
<p>Olivia was surprised at herself by her own boldness. When she saw the other girl, looking as apprehensive and paranoid as ever, she couldn't help but approach her and invite her to the kissing booth as a participant. In front of her other soccer teammates, no less. Now she could only wait.</p>
<p>"Bleh..!" she couldn't help but let out when she saw the line. <i>'This is so wrong</i>.' She was just at her limit when she felt a tap on her shoulder and she gratefully pulled back from ugly-dude number two hundred. Viola standing at her shoulder dressed in a stunning red dress and her soft smile was a sight for sore eyes. Olivia almost threw herself at her.</p>
<p>"My savior." Olivia said as she quickly got up from the stool and stood at the other girl's side. But she couldn't help but be disappointed that Viola was just relieving her of her shift instead of taking her up on the offer. Not that she expected her to. Viola probably had enough on her plate as it were. Or maybe she was just dense.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't go that far." Viola sighed, looking at the line of eager fellows. She had been right, it had been a very trying day. She had to go through confronting her mother and Sebastian as well as bumping into Duke along with several acts of miraculous dress-changing feats in public. She was actually surprised that she hasn't been found out yet. Lucky.</p>
<p>"Man, just my luck!" both girls heard behind them. At the same time they found out who was up next in line. Duke Orsino himself.</p>
<p>Olivia turned to glare at him with such malice that he flinched and almost fell back at the force of her look. Poor guy didn't know what he was messing with as he took it all in confusion and bewilderment.</p>
<p>Olivia: <i>'FUCK! Why couldn't Viola come one person later! There is no way in hell I'm going to let this guy kiss her! She might end up falling in love with him for his kissing skills or something ridiculous like that (as if that'll ever happen)! There is only one thing left to do... I'll have to kill him.'</i></p>
<p>Duke: <i>?</i></p>
<p>Viola: <i>'Oh look, it's Duke! :D'</i></p>
<p>The trio stood awkwardly on the small platform in silence for a few moments while Olivia stared threateningly at Duke who looked a bit frightened, and Viola who didn't detect that anything was wrong.</p>
<p>"So, uh, lets do this thing." Viola said, starting to sit down on the kisser's stool. Duke sat down uncertainly as well, acutely aware of the flaming daggers Olivia was sending flying his way for reason's he was not aware of. Olivia looked helplessly between Viola and Duke, knowing by some instinct that if this event took place, it'll effect the whole damn movie. She had to do something, anything.</p>
<p>Viola felt Olivia grasp her shoulders from behind and pull her to her feet. "Wha..?" she started to ask, but Olivia's loud voice interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Everyone who plans to participate in the kissing booth! There's been a change of plans!" Olivia announced in an authoritative voice that silenced the eager fellows. "Who would like to see two girls kissing instead?" There was a roar of approval from the small crowd. Viola cocked her head to the side thoughtfully.</p>
<p><i>'Two girls kissing</i>?' she thought to herself in curiosity. <i>'I guess that would be interesting. I wonder what two girls would actually do that, though...</i>' the brunette's thought process suddenly came to a grinding halt when Olivia looked at her with a firm resolve shining in her liquid eyes which Viola realized were a lot closer than when she last checked.</p>
<p>She realized with a jolt that all eyes were on them. <i>'Two girls... EH?'</i> Viola had a rare moment of clarity in which she had a grasp of what was about to happen. But she did not leave the stage. The blonde's eyes themselves held her captive, and she shivered in delight as a warm pleasant feeling washed over her. It was as if she had been waiting for this moment for the longest time.</p>
<p>Olivia steeled her resolve, knowing that she couldn't turn back now. She faced the girl she has had a crush on since she met her, determination making her movements sure and graceful to Viola's eyes. Viola watched her curiously as if waiting for her next move, without a hint of the panic Olivia had expected of her. If anything it made Olivia more excited about what she was doing.</p>
<p>So she gingerly touched her hands to Viola's forearms and slightly lifted herself on her toes, their eyes watching each other. Aware that the eyes of some hundred perverts were drooling over the spectacle, aware that she had kissed countless guys before she got to the grand finale, and aware that Duke watched the events taking place like his whole fantasy had just crumbled into a million pieces (take that, you sexy bastard!), Olivia leaned up and closed her eyes to finally gently brush her lips over Viola's like a petal touching the surface of water...</p>
<p>"What the FUCK is going on here!" Monique's shrill voice shattered the moment and tore the two girls apart. The prissy girl shook Viola's shoulder as if demanding her attention.</p>
<p>"Viola, this skank is the one who's trying to steal your brother away from me! Where is Sebastian anyway? Whore, you trying to mess with my boyfriend's sister now? Tramp!"</p>
<p>"Ex-boyfriend." Viola mumbled, still a bit dazed with the events that had almost transpired.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Olivia was deeply offended by this person. She always ruined her chances with Viola, first on their fake date and now at their almost first kiss! "Bitch, didn't I already teach you a lesson?"</p>
<p>"Viola, what the hell were you just about to do?" A third voice cut through the yelling, which was Justin's. He roughly grabbed her elbow and got into Viola's now alert face. "Don't tell me you fucking went dyke after being with me! What is that going to say about my manly reputation?" Justin demanded. Olivia saw what was happening with Justin and tried to step in but Monique kept getting in her way.</p>
<p>"Justin, let go of me!" Viola jerked her arm out of his grip and glared at him. "What the hell is wrong with you! What I do is none of your business, we broke up!"</p>
<p>"Wait, you're Sebastian's sister?" Duke came to that realization pretty quick. No wonder she looked so familiar!</p>
<p>"Stay out of our business, man!" Justin pushed Duke aside with his palm.</p>
<p>"Don't touch me, bro!"</p>
<p>"What the hell are you gonna do about?" Justin got in Duke's face.</p>
<p>"Justin, stop!" Viola demanded. Olivia tried again to get to Viola's side by pushing Monique away, but the other girl took it as a declaration of war and the bell for Olivia vs. Monique Round Two rang and claws were coming out and shredding anything they could reach. The crowd roared.</p>
<p>"Olivia!" Viola's attention was immediately diverted as she spotted a shred of blouse go flying. She moved toward them but was held back by Justin's hard grip on her arm again.</p>
<p>"You're coming with me, Viola! You're still my girlfriend and I don't want anyone to know about you going dyke!'</p>
<p>"Ex-girlfriend, ass-wipe!" Viola yelled angrily at him, ready to punch his face in herself. However, Duke beat her to the punch, literally.</p>
<p>"Get your hands off of her!" Duke yelled before going for another punch. Justin ended up tackling him off the stand and into the ground below, where Olivia's battle against the forces of evil was already being waged. The crowd got even wilder, gathering around whooping and hollering for their favorites as two fights became the center of attention in the whole carnival.</p>
<p>Viola stood on the stage hesitating, not knowing which fight to halt and ended up just screaming at both parties to knock it off. Duke and Justin's bodies ran over a popcorn machine with a loud crash, covering the ground in the white fluffy substance. Monique tripped over their bodies and dragged Olivia down with her. Viola hurriedly jumped off the stage to rush to their aid. The struggling mass of bodies attempted to get up, tripping over each other in their hastes to get a couple more hits in while their opponent was still down. Viola managed to pull Olivia out of the swinging pile by her arm. Monique was accidentally punched in the face by Justin.</p>
<p>That was the moment when some figures of authority finally showed up to the stop the fighting. It was Viola's mother and the head of the Stratford Junior League. At their presence the crowd seemed to calm down and step aside as if they hadn't been misbehaving at all. The fighting spirits of the participants seemed to drain away as they heaved up popcorn and were being yelled at by the hysterical woman.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you doing? There is no room for violence here! This is a children's carnival, goddammit!"</p>
<p><i>'Then why the hell is there a kissing booth?</i>' Olivia was tempted to say but stayed her tongue.</p>
<p>The woman looked at Viola, Olivia, and Monique, the two blondes still throwing mental daggers at each other. "And you three! My best debutantes and Viola! What has gotten into everyone today?" The three girls stared at the ground shamefully.</p>
<p>"You two, get out!" Viola's mother demanded of Duke and Justin. Olivia was lead away along with Monique by the Stratford head, and Viola was dragged kicking and screaming by her mother, who could get scarily strong when she wanted to. The crowd dispersed, their entertainment snatched away.</p>
<p>Olivia looked back, trying to snatch a glimpse of the girl she had oh so barely touched lips with. And for a second, she spotted Viola looking back at her through the crowd before a body broke their brief connection and Olivia lost sight of her.</p>
<p>Viola, back in her boy gear, slumped against the door to her dorm as she closed it behind her. Today was utterly intelligible. It was as if her memories were thrown into a whirlpool, everything went by so fast she couldn't get a grip on them. Just a single moment which burned on the forefront of her mind with picture clarity.</p>
<p>"Where were you, you just disappeared." Duke snapped her out of her thoughts, a soccer ball he was spinning on his finger blocking his face.</p>
<p>"I kind of ran into my ex, so I had to run." Viola explained tiredly. She was dragging her feet to the bed, but stopped dead in her tracks when she spotted what was up Duke's nose. "Oh my god! Is that..?" She indicated the tampon up Duke's nostril.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I borrowed one of your... yeah." he said sheepishly. "By the way, you're right, this junk works." he continued as he gingerly removed the unmentionable from his face, showing the blood on it.</p>
<p>"Hey, you're bleeding. Are you okay?" Viola asked in concern. She had been so busy figuring out her own issues that she hadn't thought about if Duke got through the fight unscathed.</p>
<p>"What?" Duke asked, perturbed at Sebastian's sudden concern. Viola immediately straightened out her 'act'.</p>
<p>"I mean... Suck it up! Be a man! Rub some dirt it in!"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll rub some dirt in it." Duke chuckled a bit before wincing. They both sat down on their beds facing each other.</p>
<p>"So... what happened?" Viola asked, even though she had been there for the whole thing. Duke fidgeted with the soccer ball in his hands.</p>
<p>"Well, I kind of had a run-in with your sister's ex."</p>
<p>"Really? Why?" Viola asked curiously. Maybe hearing the events from another witness's mouth would confirm that what had transpired at the carnival was not just a bad dream.</p>
<p>"Well... He kind of caught Olivia and your sister... about to make out at the kissing booth." Viola's stunned silence was not faked. So it had really happened. "And also your ex from Cesario's that you dumped a few nights ago saw it too and picked a fight with Olivia again." Duke continued his recount of the events. "Then Justin started getting rough with your sister so I stepped in and we fought too. It was a huge mess, dude. I can't even believe what happened."</p>
<p>"Yeah, me neither." Viola said quietly.</p>
<p>"What surprised me the most is that Olivia seemed happy to kiss your sister, man. I didn't know she was like that." Duke remarked.</p>
<p>"Oh, Olivia and my sister are friends. My sister was actually the one to introduce me to Olivia." Viola covered up her tracks swiftly. Duke nodded thoughtfully, accepting the information without question.</p>
<p>"Maybe Olivia was turned after she dated you." Duke joked, but ceased when he noticed the deeply melancholic expression on his roommate's face.</p>
<p>"But why?" Viola asked, staring at the ground in deep thought. "Why would Olivia kiss Viola?"</p>
<p>Duke shrugged. "How would I know? Maybe she was trying to make you jealous. Or maybe she already liked your sister and was trying to make her jealous by dating you. Or maybe it really was for charity. I don't know, man, don't ask me." Duke ceased speculating and leaned back against his headboard.</p>
<p>Viola contemplated over his swords, mulling them over in her mind. Any of those scenarios might be the case, but she wasn't sure. It was possible that her friend had pulled the stunt for charity purposes. She somehow doubted that someone as beautiful and smart as Olivia was interested in her. And you'd think she'd notice if Olivia was interested! Olivia had not made clear her intentions, and that only made Viola more confused in her own feelings. Heck, she didn't even know how she felt about this whole situation! The feeling Olivia had stirred up in that moment escaped Viola without explanation, leaving behind confusion and anxiety. As a result she had avoided her friend and ignored her calls after the festival, not sure how to talk to Olivia anymore.</p>
<p>She glanced hesitantly at her teammate and friend. "What do you think about all this?" she asked. Duke gave her a swift glance.</p>
<p>"I don't think anything. Its none of my business. But that's a form of love, too. So whatever makes Olivia happy, I say. And if you cared about her even a little bit, you'd let her make her own choices." Duke said with the firmness of a team captain. Viola was surprised by his answer and smiled despite herself. She leaned back on her bed, falling easily into guy mode.</p>
<p>"But wow, two chicks! How hot is that!" she said enthusiastically. "Man, wouldn't you like to see both of them naked!" Soccer ball to the side of her head was his response.</p>
<p>"Stop talking about your sister in such graphic terms." Duke said, blushing a bit. He had obviously been thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>"Sissy." Viola stuck her tongue at him and ducked another soccer ball. How many of those things did he have, anyway? After the exchange, the two occupants of the room fell into companionable silence, each sinking into his and her own pool of thought.</p>
<p>Olivia stared at her cell phone in frustration. She had tried calling Viola several times, but she never picked up. The blond worried that she was now avoiding her after what had happened at the carnival.</p>
<p><i>'Stupid! Stupid! Stupid</i>!' Olivia mentally kicked herself. Why did she freaking have to kiss her? Her dumb impulse had lead to a chain of horrible events like a line of dominoes. Not to mention she had probably confused and scared off the brunette, something she had previously tried to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>She winced as she touched a bite mark on her upper shoulder. That Monique chick did up her game from the last time they had an encounter, she'll give her that. At least she had left her own mark on the other girl, she thought with satisfaction. She thought with a smirk of the ugly fat lip Monique was probably sporting right about now. You can't cover that up with make-up!</p>
<p>However, Olivia's brief satisfaction was overshadowed by her insecurity concerning Viola. She had to accept that at this point that there was nothing she could do now but wait. She had made her move, the ball was in Viola's field now.</p>
