<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 29 - Questions and Answers-->

<P>B'Elanna crossed her arms and avoided eye contact, "I don't know what you're
talking about Q."</P>
<P>"Really," Q stepped even closer and looked down, his face only inches from
B'Elanna's. "So you're saying you thought everything that happened on the planet
was natural?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, "Yes."</P>
<P>"Well then, if you're so sure then there's no need for me now, is there?" Q
said while slowly motioning for another snap of his omnipotent fingers.</P>
<P>"Wait." B'Elanna uncrossed her arms and looked directly into Q's mischievous
eyes, "Why?"</P>
<P>Q wrapped his left arm around B'Elanna's shoulders, "Well, technically you
should be asking Q that," Q motioned towards B'Elanna's bed, snapped his
fingers, and in a blink a baby boy dressed in pink angel wings, pink angel
shoes, and a pink heart-shaped bow-and-arrow appeared on her bed. "Or should I
say Qpid?" </P>
<P>Q smiled and squeezed B'Elanna's shoulders.</P>
<P>"What?" </P>
<P>"Oh don't tell me you've never heard of him?" </P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and appeared on the bed with the baby on his lap.</P>
<P>"If you're talking about Cupid, then yes I've heard of him, but he's not
real."</P>
<P>"Of course he's not real, or at least he wasn't, at least not until now. You
see, one day my son and Iâ€¦"</P>
<P>"That's your son," B'Elanna blurted out.</P>
<P>"I know, can you see the resemblance?" Q pinched the baby's cheeks.</P>
<P>"Sure," B'Elanna said rolling her eyes.</P>
<P>"Like I was saying, one day my son and I were gallivanting around the galaxy
looking for something interesting to do, when we came upon this planet. Sad
really," Q shook his head in mock concern, "You see, the inhabitants had been at
war for two millennia divided into two distinct factions, same species,
different beliefs. If we had never come along, they were going to be at war for
another five millennia until one of the factions was completely
annihilated."</P>
<P>"So you created a peace treaty between them?"</P>
<P>"Hardly. A Q would never do something so drab as that, but my little boy
decided to put a spell on the prince of one faction and the princess of the
other faction so they'd fall in love."</P>
<P>"So they ended up making peace because of it?"<BR><BR>"Well actually, no.
They ended up destroying each other within a year."</P>
<P>"You destroyed an entire civilisation because you wanted to have a little
fun?"</P>
<P>"Don't be so hard on the boy," Q said while covering his son's ears. "It's
not his fault that his powers aren't up to Q standards as of yet, but they're
getting there." </P>
<P>B'Elanna exhaled in disbelief.</P>
<P>"Now, now Bella. I didn't come here to upset you."</P>
<P>"Then why did you come here?"</P>
<P>"To correct a mistake."<BR><BR>"A mistake?"<BR><BR>"Yes, a tragic mistake
really." Q shook his head. "You and that Borg Drone. What's her name again?" Q
feigned ignorance.<BR><BR>"Her name's Seven and she's not a drone."</P>
<P>"Yes, so I've heard, but anyway, you two were never meant to be."</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Oh, how can I explain this in terms a half-Klingon can understand? You see,
my boy here thought that putting you and that Blonde Bombshell together would be
a good thing, but it turns out you two are completely wrong for each other."</P>
<P>"I'm not listening to this," B'Elanna said while walking towards the
bathroom.</P>
<P>"Why? Are you afraid of the truth?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped, turned, and looked directly into Q's eyes, "The only truth
I know, is that you're beginning to bug the hell out of me."</P>
<P>Q grabbed his chest, "I'm hurt, really, I am. Here I am trying to help you
and you decide I'm just an annoyance."</P>
<P>"Because you are."</P>
<P>"Am I? Or are you just denying the real truth? The truth that if it wasn't
for my boy here, you and that automaton would have never fallen in love?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna remained silent, her head racing with the possibility that Q's son
was the only reason that she and Seven had fallen for each other, that none of
this was real, that her feelings were fake, and that Seven's feelings were fake
as well.</P>
<P>"I know it's a tough pill for you mortals to swallow, but it's true, you just
don't belong with Seven. Seven belongs with Kathy."</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna shouted, snapping out of her daze. </P>
<P>"Oh, as if you didn't know that already. My little Kathy's perfect for her,
isn't that right boy?" Q said while playing with his boy's hands. "What?" Q
tilted his head as if trying to hear his non-talking son better, "You think
Bella here's better for drone-girl." Q shook his head in disapproval. "Well, he
is his mother's son."</P>
<P>B'Elanna held back a curse at Q's obvious attempt to goad her. </P>
<P>"Let me guess, that's your way of saying your son put a spell on me and Seven
down on the planet."</P>
<P>"I can only wish. At least that way the spell would have worn off eventually,
but my son learned from his last mistake and decided to try something
different."<BR><BR>"And what was that?"</P>
<P>"He pulled the old 'lock a couple of mice in a cage and watch them mate'
routine."</P>
<P>B'Elanna laughed at the absurdity of the statement, "You expect me to believe
that all Seven and I had was just some animal sex?"</P>
<P>"Oh, but wasn't it?" Q snapped his fingers and his son disappeared, letting Q
stand upright again. "The two of you were isolated alone on the planet by my
son, and left with some apple trees, a cave and a waterfall, and you two ended
up coupling like two targs in lust. Which I must say, isn't pretty."</P>
<P>"It was more than that," B'Elanna said weakly, her eyes downcast.</P>
<P>"You don't sound very convinced?" Q stepped closer to B'Elanna, sensing her
anguish.</P>
<P>"I don't have to prove anything to you Q?"</P>
<P>"True, but you do have to prove it to yourself, don't you?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna kept her eyes down, not wanting to look the ever-closer Q in the
eyes.</P>
<P>"Can it be?" Q taunted, "I broke the half-Klingon already, how sad."</P>
<P>"You didn't break anything Q. In fact, I think you fixed it."<BR><BR>"Oh?" Q
lifted an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"When I was down there on the planet with Seven, I felt something that I
haven't felt in a long time."<BR><BR>"Let me guess, you felt love. Isn't that
sweet?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna ignored Q's teasing. "Yes, I did feel love, but I also felt like I
had finally let go. I felt like I had finally let go of Claire, and accepted her
death, and that I should move on and find love again."</P>
<P>"Isn't that what you did with Tommy Boy?"</P>
<P>"That's what I thought, but it wasn't the same. He was safe, someone I could
care about without fearing the worst."</P>
<P>"That's rather cold of you don't you think?"</P>
<P>"I know, but it's the truth. I never wanted to go through the pain of losing
someone I cared so much about again.</P>
<P>"Are you sure you lost her?"<BR><BR>B'Elanna's head snapped up. "What are you
talking about?" </P>
<P>Q calmly walked over to the table in the middle of the room, sat down, and
casually crossed his legs. "What if I told you, you haven't lost her?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna stomped over to Q and pounded a fist on the table, "You son of a
bitch."</P>
<P>"What?" Q shrugged his shoulders innocently.</P>
<P>"You want the Captain and Seven together so badly that you would lie about
Claire being alive?"</P>
<P>"Oh, this has nothing to do with the Captain."</P>
<P>"Then why are you doing this?"</P>
<P>"Like I said, I was trying to fix a mistake my son made."</P>
<P>"He obviously doesn't think it's a mistake, so why do you?"</P>
<P>"If I told you that, I would break the temporal prime directive and I most
definitely don't want do that. It would cost me my pips, see."</P>
<P>Q pulled out his collar and lightly tapped his pips with a finger.</P>
<P>"So what? Janeway throws me in the brig a couple hundred more times for
dating Seven? I can deal with that."</P>
<P>"Silly Klingon, you have no idea what's ahead."<BR><BR>"So tell me."</P>
<P>"Believe me, I would like to, but the continuum has rules."</P>
<P>"So these rules allow you to meddle in our affairs and change timelines, but
you can't tell me why I'm not supposed to be with Seven?"</P>
<P>"If I told you, you wouldn't believe me."</P>
<P>"You're probably right, but can you at least tell me this? Were you lying
when you said Claire's still alive?"</P>
<P>"I never actually said it, you just inferred it from my ambiguous
statement."<BR><BR>"Fine, then was my inference correct?"</P>
<P>"Possibly, but do you really want to know?" Are you willing to give up the
chance to be with someone right now, for the slim chance of finding a lost love
decades from now?"</P>
<P>"So she's still alive?"<BR><BR>"Once again, I never said that. I just asked
you a simple question, do you really want to know?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna mulled the question over in her brain, trying to think about what
she would do if Claire was alive, if she would be willing to sacrifice a
relationship with Seven for the remote possibility of being with Claire, and if
she could go on living, knowing she had a chance to find out once and for all if
Claire had died, only to give it up due to cowardice.</P>
<P>Q waited impatiently, tapping his fingers on the table.</P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her dry lips and finally answered, "Yes, I have to know."</P>
<P>"Then yes, she is."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart dropped. Although she was elated to know that Claire was
still alive, she was now faced with an impossible decision. Her first love or
her new love, but she had some doubts as to Q's motive and honesty.</P>
<P>"Why did you tell me?"<BR><BR>"Because I thought you deserved to know as
much."</P>
<P>"Won't telling me break one of your rules?"</P>
<P>"Actually, since your decision would have been the same whether or not you
knew, it doesn't change a thing."</P>
<P>"And what decision is that?"</P>
<P>"You tell me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna recalled how she and Claire had made love under the suns of Ishtar,
how they had slept in each other's arms under the starry sky of Earth, how
Claire had proposed to her with the messenger bear, how they had kissed each
other goodbye just before Claire went on that suicide mission, how she had
mourned her loss for years, not wanting to believe she had died, how everyone,
including Chakotay, told her to let go, that it wasn't worth it anymore, and
here she was faced with the fact that Claire was still alive, still waiting for
her somewhere in the galaxy.</P>
<P>Then B'Elanna recalled the time she had spent with Seven down on the planet,
how Seven had protected her from the cold by wrapping her arms around her, how
Seven was injured and she had taken care of her, how they had made love for the
first time under that waterfall, how they had spent the night curled up in each
other's arms as the sun set, how they had awakened to the most beautiful sunrise
in recorded history, how they had declared their love for one another, and how
Seven was her teddy bear. </P>
<P>The tears began to well up in B'Elanna's eyes as she remembered the look of
pain in Seven's eyes in the holo-deck and how guilty she felt at accepting Tom's
proposal, knowing that it would break Seven's heart.</P>
<P>Remembering the joy in Seven's eyes when she said 'I love you,' for the first
time, was something B'Elanna wanted to see again. </P>
<P>"The answer's Seven, Q." B'Elanna said contentedly.</P>
<P>"Very well, but you still haven't proven that you love her, or are worthy or
her love."</P>
<P>"I don't have to prove anything to you Q."</P>
<P>"Of course you don't. Like I said before, you have to prove it to yourself.
What can you possibly give her that no one else can?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her dry lips, somewhat stunned at the question. The
half-Klingon racked her brain for an answer that would put Q in his place. </P>
<P>"I would die for her," B'Elanna said proudly.</P>
<P>Q laughed lightly, "So would half the people on this ship, including Chuckles
and not to mention my dear Kathy."</P>
<P>B'Elanna scrunched her nose, annoyed that Q had just bested her. </P>
<P>"What can you," Q began again, "A half-breed, not even a full human, possibly
give a Borg drone?"</P>
<P>"That's it," B'Elanna said confidently.</P>
<P>"What's it?"</P>
<P>"We're both half-human."</P>
<P>"Well then, that just makes you two a perfect match. Oh wait, Hairball and
Kathy are both 100% human, then I guess they too must be a perfect match," Q
said sarcastically.</P>
<P>"That's not what I meant. I meant that because we're both half-human, I could
help her deal with not being accepted by others, especially when we get back
home."</P>
<P>"That's a little presumptuous of you isn't it? What makes you think you'll
all make it home? And even if you do, don't you think the holographic projection
would be a far better teacher in that category? After all, the ball of light
won't stop complaining about how oppressed he is."</P>
<P>"True, but the Doctor isn't human and Seven can't love him."</P>
<P>"Okay, fine, how about Kathy? She's done a fine job helping her become
half-human. What makes you think she can't help her become fully human
again?"</P>
<P>"I don't know," B'Elanna said softly.</P>
<P>"That's a first. You actually admitted you don't know something."</P>
<P>"Well what am I suppose to say Q? Everything I say you put down as being
trivial or make it seem like it doesn't matter. I say I love her and you say
prove it, I say I would die for her and you say big deal, I say I can help her
with the transition to becoming human and you say so can Janeway. Tell me Q,
what do you want me to say?"</P>
<P>"I don't want you to say anything? It's all up to you. You don't have to
answer the question, but in doing so, you admit defeat and that you are not
worthy of her love. So the choice is yours Bella, what can you give her that no
one else can?"</P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and B'Elanna ended up in the softest chair she'd ever
been in, but that was the furthest thing from her mind. Right now, she had to
answer this question, not for Q's sake, she could care less about what Q wanted,
but for herself. B'Elanna put her hand to her forehead and closed her eyes,
concentrating, running through everything she had, everything she could do, her
skills, her strengths, and even her weaknesses. Maybe it wasn't something that
she could give Seven, but something that Seven could give her. She thought about
that possibly long and hard, but gave up, figuring Q would just laugh it off as
avoiding the question. </P>
<P>As B'Elanna sat quietly in the pink fluffy chair that Q had made for her, the
omnipotent being sat quietly as well, amazingly patient this time. </P>
<P>B'Elanna thought about her engineering skills, about her experiences as a
child, about her Klingon heritage, about her human heritage, about her Maquis
days, about her first love, and about everything that was uniquely her. Then she
knew. It was her. It was as simple as that. It wasn't one thing, it was
everything. The thing that she could give Seven that nobody else could, was her.
</P>
<P>"It's me," B'Elanna said, opening her eyes to see a satisfied grin on Q's
face.</P>
<P>"Congratulations," Q clapped his hands together, "You finally figured it out.
It's a shame really, I've asked that very question over a thousand times in my
entire existence, and only one other person has ever given me that answer.
People go though their lives thinking that the most important thing they can
give is to die a valiant death, or to buy the most expensive gift, or to bore
their lover to death with their past experiences, or anything else that is
singular. The fact is, the one thing that someone can give that no one else can,
is them and everything that goes with them. Their strengths, their flaws; it's
the whole package. It's just too bad that only two people in the galaxy know
that."</P>
<P>"I can't believe I'm actually going to say this, but thank you Q."</P>
<P>"Don't thank me yet, but you can thank me for this."</P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and a white envelope appeared in B'Elanna's hands.</P>
<P>"What's this?" B'Elanna asked while trying to open the envelope.</P>
<P>"Oh, you can't open it."</P>
<P>"Then what's the point?"</P>
<P>"It'll open by itself when it's ready. Just keep it around until it does.
Just for your information, holding it up to a light won't help either, neither
will any of your ship's sensors."</P>
<P>"Thanks for the warning, I was going to spend a whole five seconds trying to
pry it open."</P>
<P>Q smiled at the sarcasm, he really liked her spunk, but it's not as if he'd
ever tell her that. "Well, if there's no more questions to be asked and answers
to be given, then my work here is done. Although I don't think Kathy will like
the results very much, but I guess I could hook her up with Hairball or
Chuckles."</P>
<P>"Wait a minute Q. When you said that only one other person gave the answer I
did, who was it?"</P>
<P>Q looked at her with a gleam in his eye, "Oh I think you know the answer to
that." </P>
<P>And then he was gone, leaving a smiling B'Elanna back in the brig and the
envelope he gave her on the pink fluffy chair that was still in her room.</P>
