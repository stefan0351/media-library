<!-- Teaparty in Wonderland \ Part 2 -->

<p>Brooke was still smiling as she exited the room, relishing the moment she head-cheerleader has stumped the chief editor of the school paper. She smirked at the thought and headed towards the Novak.</p>

<p>"You're still here?" Brooke asked an irritated Nicole who was glaring at the mirror as if challenging the reflection to a duel.</p>

<p>"I told her not to touch desserts but no . " she pointed to a door. Brooke frowned wondering what Nicole meant. A loud flatulence engulfed the Novak and Brooke shook her head getting what Nicole meant as the pungent smell made her remember the cafeteria was serving red bean ice-cream for desserts.</p>

<p>Brooke quickly opened the door of the Novak so that no one suffocates. "Cheerleaders exodus: Red bean scream by Sam MacPherson" Brooke laughed quietly at the thought of Sam covering such a story.</p>

<p>Finally with the sound of a flush out came a wobbling Mary Cherry. "Oh mah gawd. That was some ."</p>

<p>"Don't even say it MC . Are you ready to go?" Nicole started towards the door without even waiting for a reply. She flashed Brooke a smile, "I'll make sure I save a couple of pieces for you, hon." She winked. Brooke mouthed her Thanks.</p>

<p>"Bye-uh Brooke," Mary Cherry hurried to catch up with Nicole.</p>

<p>Peace. Finally. She thought as she collapsed onto the sofa closing her eyes for what seemed like a moment. When she came to, she felt a presence in the room. She opened her left eye warily and was relieved to see that it was Sam who was changing out of her blouse and into a white t-shirt. When Sam turned around, Brooke pretended to start waking up.</p>

<p>"Hey, had a quickie with the sandman eh?" Sam grinned mischievously.</p>

<p>Brooke arched an eyebrow and looked at her watch. She had been sleeping for almost an hour. "What are you still doing here Sam?"</p>
<p>"Paper. I just finished my article.  So how come you're not off with the rest to that sale thingy?"</p>
<p>"I erm . I wanted to head for the cheerleader clubhouse for a meeting"</p>
<p>"Oh . you guys have a clubhouse?" Sam asked surprised that there was such a thing.</p>

<p>"Yes it's not exclusively ours, it's for all the cheerleading teams in this area. We meet once a while to update each other on the latest etc." Brooke explained.</p>

<p>"Wow . "</p>

<p>"Wow? Not what a waste of space for air-heads? Or how about how many people did we have to flash ourselves to get funding for ."</p>

<p>"Brooke. I said  `Wow' I meant `Wow' that's all ok." Sam snapped, rolled her eyes and started to head for the door.</p>

<p>"Sam . I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me," she caught Sam's arm as she walked passed her.</p>
<p>Sam sighed. "Practice"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Practice. We're too used to coming up with smart repartees in half a minute to be able to say something nice without sounding suspiciously scheming." She quirked an eyebrow at Brooke who nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"So do you need an extra arm or can I have mine back?" Sam grinned. Brooke swatted her arm gently, "Yes I need it to carry all the textbooks I need for this weekend's homework to the car."</p>
<p>She pulled a groaning Sam towards her locker.</p>

<p>"How about the library, Brooke? Have you checked if there are more?" Sam grunted as she struggled to keep the strap of her bag on her shoulder while carrying the stack of books in her arms. Brooke looked over at Sam and laughed.</p>
<p>She took a few more books of Sam's load and put them on top of her pile. Sam watched in awe as the seemingly dainty-looking cheerleader, who'd probably sob in pain should she break a nail, carry her pile of books which was much heavier than hers.</p>

<p>They walked to Brooke's car where Sam gladly threw the pile into the backseat. "Where are you heading Sam? I'll give you a lift." She opened the door and gently nudged Sam into her car. Sam got in and thought quickly about her destination. She had really intended to go home but she also wanted to spend a little more time with Brooke.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The café around the corner . about 5 minute drive from here. But it's ok if it's out of your way, you know ."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, that's not far at all. Besides it's not like I'm carrying you, "She laughed, "I'm driving remember."</p>

<p>"Yeah well I was just worried all the turns might get too complicated for you." Sam teased.</p>

<p>"Miss MacPherson, you're absolutely incorrigible," Brooke retorted in mock anger. "Take that!" She said as she threw a ball of tissue at Sam.</p>

<p>Sam caught it just before it hits her face. "Hahaha . quick hands, Princess, but I've got quicker reflex."</p>

<p>"Not quick enough though . "She turned to nod at the ball of tissue" .</p>
<p>to realise that that's used tissue I used to blow my nose this morning when I sent us to school remember?" Brooke threw her head back in laughter not able to contain seeing the stunned look on Sam's face.</p>

<p>"Ewww . Brooke. You're sick." Sam laughed throwing the offensive item back at Brooke where it landed in her lap. </p>
<p>"Nope, I'm pretty remember? You said so in the lab." She smiled haughtily.</p>

<p>". My my . modest aren't we?" Sam grinned.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled, "Well we're here. Why are you here again?"</p>
<p>Sam froze for a moment (Think Think Think!) "Oh I er . I'm . source."</p>

<p>"Coherent speech would truly help my understanding," Brooke snickered.</p>

<p>"I'm here to meet a source for an article," Sam said firmly.</p>

<p>"Ooh. The hotshot school reporter in action. Can I watch?"</p>

<p>"No!" Sam said a tad bit too forcefully.</p>

<p>Brooke eyed Sam suspiciously, "Ok Spill it MacPherson. Who are you meeting? Is this suppose to be some hot date I don't know about? He's not from around here is he?"</p>

<p>"Jeez, Brooke. No . it's just that . I mean don't you have some meeting to go to?"</p>
<p>"Not till 4. It's only 2 plus now," Brooke smiled wickedly "I can wait with you, I mean if it's really not some hot date that I'm interrupting ."</p>

<p>Sam figured that since her make-believe source is never going to show up, she didn't see the harm in letting Brooke wait. After all she had a strong feeling she'd get tired in no time and leave.</p>

<p>Brooke chose a seat near the window overlooking the street so that Sam can see if her source has arrived. Sam took to studying her menu before Brooke gently knocked against Sam's causing her to blurt out "Fish and chips and coke, please."</p>

<p>Brooke grinned. "Sam . really now. Is this a blind date?"</p>

<p>"No!" Sam practically leapt out of the chair.</p>

<p>"Ok ok, calm down I was just teasing you Sammy. Come on, sit down please ." Brooke held Sam by her wrist and gently pulled her back down to her seat.</p>

<p>Sam felt Brooke's hand burning into her wrist. It was burning but not necessarily painful. Well not exactly . you know what it's like to have ice directly applied to skin? It's a tad bit painful, prickly even but as it melts, it feels all tingly and fabulous . the aftermath so to speak. Well this was pretty much that.</p>

<p>Sam took a deep breath. She knew the lying was making her uncomfortable and jittery. She thought perhaps she should just admit to Brooke that she lied and that her source was not coming when she realised that this was a good opportunity to get to know Brooke.</p>

<p>I mean how often did they get to sit in a café and have a decent conversation . or at least attempt to have a civil one that does not include ripping the other's jugular vein off her neck. She smiled a small smile.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I was just nervous. I've never had someone accompany me on a case before," Sam explained. "Let's eat, ok?"</p>

<p>Brooke was taken aback by Sam's metamorphic change in moods but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless. "OK . I'll just have the Quiche Lorraine and ice-tea."</p>

<p>Sam nodded at the waitress who came and took their order. When she left, there was deafening silence between them.</p>

<p>"So ."     </p>
<p>"So ."</p>

<p>"What's with the book McQueen? Is there some test or quiz I don't know remember?"</p>
<p>"Nope, I just wanted to finish off my assignments earlier," Brooke shrugged.</p>

<p>"You're a patchwork of paradoxes you know ." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"Wow . patchwork of paradoxes? I like that."</p>

<p>"So Miss Head-Cheerleader, aside from being a closet nerd, what else turns you on?" Sam wiggled her eyebrows mischievously.</p>

<p>"Hmmm . fresh white embroidered bedsheets, Audrey Hepburn's black dress and lots and lots of ."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>"Wild flowers actually." Brooke laughed. Sam joined her laughter. "And yours?"</p>

<p>"A good book ."</p>

<p>"You don't say ." Brooke teased.</p>
<p>"Hey no interrupting!" Sam gently flicked her fingers at Brooke's knuckles to which Brooke pretended to be severely hurt and rubbed them lovingly. "As I was saying . a good book, freshly brewed coffee and ."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>Sam laughed, "Buildings actually."</p>

<p>"Building? Really? Why?" Brooke asked leaning forward towards her company.</p>

<p>"Well I don't know I've always had this passion for buildings, skyscrapers, country homes, contemporary houses . it's silly really," Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"No, come one share some more . why ."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a waiter who was sending them their food. Sam could see that he was checking Brooke out of the corner of his eyes even as he served them their food. She rolled her eyes. Brooke, on the other hand, was uncomfortable with the way the waiter was looking at her.</p>
<p>"Alone at last" Brooke breathed out.</p>
<p>Sam smiled hearing the comment but decided not to tease her. They were getting along well so far. They ate in companionable silence before Sam spoke, "Brooke, I know this is weird but when school is over, you know what I'm going to miss most?"</p>

<p>"Me?" Brooke grinned and batted her eyelids.</p>

<p>"Erm . close. Actually fighting with you ."</p>

<p>"No!" Brooke gasped in mock horror.</p>

<p>Sam smiled and continued, "Really, you're one of the few people I enjoy arguing with. I mean you put up a good fight. Associating with you has been exhausting and intellectually draining."</p>

<p>"Why MacPherson . Are you throwing me a compliment?" Brooke teased. "Why don't you just admit it? Say that I'm fabulous company ."</p>
<p>"If I do, does that mean I'd get another big sloppy wet kiss on the mouth?" Sam arched her eyebrows mischievously.</p>

<p>Brooke blushed recalling herself say the exact same words back in the lab but she wasn't going to let Sam get away with this. "Only if you behave ..."</p>

<p>"Oh." This is so weird they both thought.</p>
