<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 18 -->

<p>"Do you want something to drink?  I could get you something to drink?  We
have cold drinks…there's…"</p>

<p>"It's okay, I'm good," Harrison said holding up his hand effectively cutting
off Sam's manic speech.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?  I could get you something to eat…"</p>

<p>"Really, Sam, I'm fine.  Take it easy, you look like you're about to rupture
something," he said, starting to get concerned about why she wanted to talk
to him.  This wasn't at all in character-not counting her recent bouts of
weirdness.</p>

<p>"Sorry.  I'm just a bit stressed.  I'm tense, I mean my back's all
knotted…it's not pleasant," she replied rubbing at the back of her neck
anxiously once again.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I caught on to that whole anxiety thing,"  he responded softly.  "Why
don't you just tell me what's on your mind, and maybe we'll both feel
better, because quite frankly you're kind freaking me out here."</p>

<p>"Right," Sam said sitting down on the couch then immediately standing back
up again.  "I don't know if you've noticed, but lately I've been rather…"</p>

<p>"Crazy?"</p>

<p>"Not the word I would've gone with, but essentially," Sam responded frowning
slightly.  "Well it's kind of because I've got this thing."</p>

<p>"Thing?" Harrison asked only vaguely following her.  "What like a growth?
Oh my god is it a brain tumor?" He had heard that brain tumors often caused
odd behavior in people due to the way they pressed on the brain.</p>

<p>"No!  No.  I don't have a tumor or a growth, by thing I meant that I have
got this…relationship," Sam said slightly unnerved by his exclamation.</p>

<p>"Relationship?  Ohhh, get down with your bad-self," he responded making
sound cheap porno sounds and doing a little dance.</p>

<p>"Right, the only thing is it's not that simple," she went on running a hand
through her hair.  "It's not…a conventional relationship."</p>

<p>"Why is he like shorter than you?" Harrison asked.  It pained Sam to no end
that he asked the question with the utmost sincerity.  If he had at least
been meeting her half way it would have all been okay, but no, he had choose
today to lose his brain.</p>

<p>"No! I mean…he's a she," Sam blurted out.  That was necessary, if she didn't
just say it was never going to get said.</p>

<p>"A girl?" Harrison asked staring at her unblinkingly.  "You're dating a
girl?…in a gay way?"</p>

<p>"That's kind of how it works," Sam confirmed.</p>

<p>"Is anybody in this town still straight?" he asked throwing his hands up in
the air dramatically.  "At least you caught it young," he continued turning
back around so that he was facing Sam.</p>

<p>"That's true," Sam responded more for the sake of saying something than
anything else.</p>

<p>"You know what this is fantastic, I can't believe it.  YOU, can get a
girlfriend and I can't," he went on.  "Where's the justice in that?  She's
probably gorgeous too, isn't she?  She's hot right?"</p>

<p>"I…" Sam started caught off guard by his reaction, "yeah."</p>

<p>"I thought as much, that would complete the circle," Harrison responded
shaking his head dejectedly.  There was no justice in the world, he was sure
of that now.  "If she models for Victoria's secret I'm moving to a deserted
island and dedicating my life to the study of exotic birds and fauna," he
went on pacing the room.  "Do I know her?" he asked finally stopping.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded.</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to tell me, or are we playing twenty-questions?" he
asked looking at her expectantly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that was kind of the point of asking you here," Sam responded
stalling for time.</p>

<p>"Okay, then.  Who?" he was actually intensely curious as to who it could be.</p>

<p>Sam paused, her ears were ringing and she was fairly certain that she was
shaking.  This was the moment of truth and she felt like she was going to
pass out.  "Brooke."  She knew that she opened her mouth and that she had
spoken, but she couldn't remember hearing the word actually come out of her
mouth.  If it wasn't for the instantaneous reaction on Harrison's mouth, she
might have thought that she hadn't really said it at all.</p>

<p>"What?" he practically chocked out.  He felt like his heart had stopped
beating, the second Brooke's name came out of Sam's mouth it was like a
complete suspension of his existence.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam repeated, her voice was stronger this time, it was almost as
if the mention of her lovers name had infused her with some badly needed
backbone.  "I'm seeing Brooke."</p>

<p>"Brooke McQueen?" Harrison asked dumbly.  His head was pounding, and his
vision was blurring.</p>

<p>"Brooke McQueen," Sam confirmed watching him sadly.  She had never wanted to
hurt him, but she had no choice in the matter, her heart had made her
decision for her and there was no turning back.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked finally flopping down onto the couch.  His voice wavering
with an emotion Sam couldn't readily identify.</p>

<p>"Why?" the brunette asked confused by the question.</p>

<p>"Why her?  Why of all the tens of thousands of teenagers in L.A., of the
thousands of students at our school, why out of all of those people did you
have to pick the one girl I've wanted since I before I even knew what
wanting was?" he asked his voice raising, his hands clutching at the couch
desperately.  Sam thought that she could see tears in his eyes, she took a
step back.</p>

<p>"I didn't pick her," Sam responded softly.  "It wasn't deliberate, I didn't
even know what was happening until it happened and by then it was too late.
I had fallen…and I didn't want to get up."</p>

<p>Harrison didn't respond to her verbally, her merely looked up and over at
her with shimmering eyes, piercing her with his pain.  And she felt it as
acutely as if it were her own, in fact only a day before it had been her own
and she knew how he felt, she more than knew how he felt, and it tore her up
because she knew it was hell.  He was mourning the loss of a love he never
had, like she had been mourning the loss of a love she had barely tasted.
Of the two she wasn't sure what was worse, because if it had been true, that
Brooke had gone back to Josh, at least the brunette could say that she had
loved Brooke and been loved in return and that was something real, something
tangible.  Harrison, he only had a phantom of love, a love Sam knew to be
the sun, and the moon and whole world.</p>

<p>"Sam, you're not gonna believe this…okay, okay, I'm in line at the Pottery
Barn…" Brooke started say coming in the door, emoting before she had even
made it all the way inside.  "Yeah, I know, don't ask.  So I'm in line at
the Pottery Barn and guess who…" the blonde paused as she came to the
threshold of the living room and saw the picture inside.  "Oh," Brooke
commented softly as her eyes darted around the room and she considered the
fastest way to get the hell out of there.</p>

<p>However, just as she was about to make her move and pray for the best Sam
turned her head to look at her, and the moment she saw the expression on her
girlfriends face she knew that she had told Harrison about the two of them.
And, considering the silence that hovered around the room, and the morose
looks on their faces, she knew that it hadn't been roses and sunshine.  She
immediately made her way over to Sam who looked like she was at her breaking
point.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Brooke asked softly as she placed her hand on Sam's shoulder
rubbing it tenderly with her finger.  She was aware of Harrison's eyes on
them, but she was only one person and as such could only deal with one of
them at a time.  Harrison was just going to have to wait his turn.</p>

<p>Sam simply nodded her head, her posture straightening and her eyes clearing
at the feel of Brooke's touch.</p>

<p>Once Brooke was certain that Sam was indeed okay, she turned her head so
that she was looking at Harrison.  He was watching them with one of the most
disparaged expressions she had ever seen.  She had seen the same look on
Josh's face at the golf course a few nights before and it had broken her
heart then.  It still did.</p>

<p>"Harrison," she started to say, but she stopped when he stood up and held up
his hand to her.</p>

<p>"Don't…just don't," he said shaking his head.  "Congratulations…or whatever,
I'm not quite sure what the etiquette for a situation like this is so you'll
have to excuse any faux pas on my part."</p>

<p>"Harrison," Sam tried finally finding her voice.</p>

<p>"No," he said waving his hand still watching them intently.  After Brooke
had came over to Sam, he had noticed his friend move towards her, into her,
almost unconsciously.  When Brooke had first walked over there had been a
small space between them, but that had disappeared imperceptibly leaving Sam
literally in Brooke's arms, where for the first time all day she actually
seemed relaxed.  "I mean it.  Congratulations.  Really."</p>

<p>And with that he turned around and made his way out of the living room, into
the hallway and the door into some much needed fresh air before he
completely lost it.</p>
