<p>"Hey Mom"</p>

<p>"Hi honey your home kind of late"</p>

<p>"Yeah Lily and I went for coffee and conversation after school and I
guess we kind of lost track of time.  I'm sorry if you worried."</p>

<p>"I wasn't worried yet but try to remember to call next time."</p>

<p>"Sure Mom.  I don't see Brooke's car outside hasn't she come home
yet?"</p>

<p>"She and Nicole came by after cheerleading practice and then they
went to Nicole's to watch a video."</p>

<p>"Oh, well I'm going to head upstairs."</p>

<p>"Sam I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>Sam felt her pulse quicken and her breath caught in her chest.  She
wiped her suddenly damp palms on her jean-clad thighs.  &lt;&lt; Oh Jesus!
What if she asks?  What am I going to say?  I wish Brooke were here.
We never talked about what happens if one of them asked.  Shit!  OK
Sam calm down this could be nothing more than she misses me; we
hardly ever have time alone especially since Mac was born.  Yeah
that's it.  Please God I'm asking really nicely here.  College would
be a good topic that makes sense we haven't really talked that much
about it at all. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Jane watched Sam's expression go from open to guarded to panicked and
back to guarded again in less than a minute.  &lt;&lt; I knew it! I knew
something was going on with her. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>"Can this wait, I've got a ton of homework and I have to work some
more on my Columbia application."</p>

<p>"Actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about, sweetheart."
&lt;&lt; YES, yes, yes thank you God &gt;&gt; It was all the brunette could do to
not jump up and down for joy.  Sam sat down at the kitchen table
across from her mother.</p>

<p>"Sure Mom.  What about it?  I know money's an issue but I really want
to go to Columbia.  I have excellent grades and I got a 1450 on my
SATs; Mr. Rosen, my guidance counselor, says I should be a shoo in
for a scholarship of some sort and I figure I can take out student
loans for the rest."</p>

<p>"Columbia, oh Sam that's so far away.  I was hoping you would go
somewhere closer to home like UCLA or USC maybe.  But if your heart
is set on Columbia….well what's your 2nd and 3rd choice?"</p>

<p>"Second, University of Missouri and third Berkeley or University of
Chicago.  But Mom I really want to go to Columbia it's got the best
undergraduate journalism program and you know what they say `
everyone should live in NYC for at least a year'."</p>

<p>"What about Brooke?"</p>

<p>"I don't know Mom you'll have to talk to her about that."</p>

<p>"What if she doesn't want to go that far away?"</p>

<p>"I don't know we'll work something out I guess."</p>

<p>Mother and daughter stared at each other across the kitchen table.
Silence lay thick and heavy between them.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Shit I didn't mean to say that.  Now what? &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Oh God it's true.  This is the `something' I've been sensing.  Why
couldn't she be pregnant that would be so much easier.  What am I
going to say to Mike? &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Sam bolted out of the kitchen and up the stairs Jane hot on her
heels.  She reached Sam's door just in time for it to close in her
face.  </p>

<p>Sam stood with her back to the door desperately trying not to
hyperventilate, her mind racing &lt;&lt; Shit Fuck DAMN! Brooke where are
you?  I didn't want it to be this way now what are we going to do? &gt;&gt;
Slowly Sam sank to the floor, drawing her knees to her chest she let
her head fall forward and began to rock back and forth.  </p>

<p>Jane stood in the hallway unable to bring herself to knock on Sam's
door.  As her shock and dismay began to settle itself like a thick
and heavy cloak around her shoulders she her a low keening wail come
from her daughter's room.</p>

<hr>

<p>Brooke came home some 30 minutes later and found Jane sitting in the
dimly lit living room.  "Hi Mom" she called out as she sailed through
the living room.  Jane did not respond.</p>

<p>"Jane? " No response again.</p>

<p>Brooke stood in front of Jane and snapped her fingers "JANE!"</p>

<p>Jane shook her head to clear the cobwebs "Oh Brooke, hi."</p>

<p>"Hi yourself, are you okay?  Did something happen you look out of it?"</p>

<p>"Please don't hurt her."  "Excuse me?"</p>

<p>"You love her don't you?"  Comprehension dawned on Brooke and she
took a seat on the sofa next to Jane.</p>

<p>"Yes I do, very much.  And I love you very much too."</p>

<p>"Don't be coy with me Brooke.  I'm not playing around here.  I'm more
serious than you can imagine.  I'm not stupid, I've seen the way you
two have been.  I've known something was going on with you two.
Honestly though I though one of you was pregnant especially when I
found that home pregnancy kit box in your bathroom a few months
back.  Now I wish one of you was.  I'll tell you what Brooke why
don't you make my day, no make that my year, and tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me you're not in love with Sam, that you really are pregnant
because frankly I'd rather have to tell your father that he is going
to be a grandpa."  Jane's voice dropped to a barely audible
whisper "How did this happen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  I just know it did.  I love Sam.  I can't imagine my
life without her.  I don't want to imagine my life without her.  She
is my joy, the sun-filled sky I turn my face toward.  The ocean whose
depths I want to explore.  She's my first though in the morning and
my last one before sleep.  She's who and what I think about when I
eat the food that keeps me strong and healthy for her.  And if she
feels for me even a tenth of what I feel for her then I consider
myself truly blessed."</p>

<p>As Brooke spoke Jane watched her face transform from that of the
young girl she though she knew to that of a young woman utterly and
completely in love, secure in the knowledge that she was loved in
return.  And in that instant of transformation Jane knew, as much as
she wished it wasn't true; Brooke loved Sam and Sam loved Brooke.  It
was as simple in its complexity as that.</p>
