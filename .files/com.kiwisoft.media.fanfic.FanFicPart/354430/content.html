<!-- Empty Hate \ Part 2 (a week later) -->

<p>"Something is wrong," Brooke thought as she entered the house. It was
quiet, an eerie threatening silence that seemed only to hide
something more sinister. All the lights were off, and the hallway was
dark. "Nobody home," she thought, which was odd. Outside it was
rainy, and the sky was cloudy, gray and bleak, and a bitter wind
stung her; the polar opposite to a normal California day. And strange
enough, her house didn't seem to be a haven at. It was like the storm
had seeped in, making the atmosphere as gloomy as the wild sky. When
she had woken up, it had been a sunny day, but there had still had
been an uneasy undercurrent that ran through her family unit. At
breakfast Sam had just stayed hunched over a bowl of cereal, not even
eating. And of course, Brooke had jovially muttered a comment
criticizing Sam's choice of apparel, as was the custom. The weird
thing was, Sam just nodded, didn't even look up.  Of all the way's to
hurt her feelings, that was probably her most effective way;
indifference. I mean, love was something, hatred was something, both
strong feelings, equally consuming. Indifference was, well,
unacceptable.</p>

<p>Brooke broke off that train of thought, and tried to think about more
positive things. Tonight was her first official date with her
boyfriend Josh, even though they had already been going out for a
week. Brooke unconsciously frowned as she pondered over the last
week. Every good argument had its merits, but for the last week Sam
had barely spoken to her, and whenever she had made some snide quip
to provoke a reaction, any reaction, all she had gotten was a glance.
Truth be told, she was getting desperate, and fast. It was like they
weren't frien......"Hold up," Brooke muttered. And just when did that
annoying incident take place? They were not friends, but they
probably weren't exactly enemies. They were completely in the
category of something. Or nothing. Or....</p>

<p>Brooke's thoughts were cut off by a soft pitiful sound that came and
left so quickly, she couldn't even be sure that she had heard it at
all. Brooke tentatively walked from her room, across the bathroom,
and gripped the doorknob to Sam's room. She was a little bit afraid.
She would be an unwelcome intruder, promptly thrown out of the room.
But another small sound escaped from the door, and she stepped in,
and gasped. The room was dark, and the blinds only let in the tiniest
bit of light. That wasn't what she was noticing, though. All she saw
was Sam's curled up figure lying on the bed, with her face in a
pillow, as if she was trying to muffle the sobs, her whole body
silently shaking. Brooke gasped, and Sam slightly pulled her head
from the pillow. Even in the soft light, her eyes sparkled with
unshed tears, and shining with an intensity that was somehow breaking
her heart. "What's wrong?" Brooke whispered, as she tentatively made
her way over to Sam's bed.</p>

<p>For a minute Sam didn't answer, and just before Brooke gave up, there
came a reply. "When I got here, I was really depressed, because, this
was our day. Me and my dad's. Every year we would drive down to this
festival in Seattle, and we would get our face painted, and cotton
candy," Sam said as she wiped her eyes with her sleeve. "But the year
before he died, I didn't go with him, I said I was to busy." Sam's
voice broke for a second, and she wiped at her overflowing eyes with
her sleeve. Sarcastically,  Sam muttered, "to bust with my life to
bother with him." Her tone changed, and now it was filled with
sorrow, "If I had only known that it would be the last time, I would
have given anything, I would give....;"</p>

<p>Brooke reached over and gathered Sam up in her arms, holding Sam to
her. She felt Sam's weight against her, and she felt Sam tense up,
and then slowly relax in her arms, letting her cry, murmuring soft
things in her ear. Eventually Sam's breathing began to lengthen and
she realized that she had fallen asleep on her shoulder. Brooke laid
Sam down onto the pillow, and impulsively, she placed a soft kiss on
her forehead, and walked out of the room, hoping that the morning sun
would cleanse the earth with it's morning ray's, and carry away her
grief.</p>
