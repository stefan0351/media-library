<!-- Telling Series \ Section 1: Mom - After The Smoke Clears -->

<p>It had been a very long twenty four hours and Jane couldn't
wait for Mike and Brooke to get home for more than one reason. She had missed
them both for the week that they had been gone but more than that she wasn't
sure she could take much more of Sam in her present condition. Sam was almost
literally bouncing off the walls with anticipation. And it wasn't a pretty
sight. The last time Jane had witnessed her daughter in such a state was when
Sam was seven and had eaten the entire stash of Easter candy. The hyperactive,
hopped up, sugar rush aside, the binge left the poor girl vomiting for the next
two days straight and promising never to touch a piece of candy ever again. Of
course, said vow was never kept. </p>
<p>And now she was at it again, bouncing from room to room on an
aimless journey to find something to do with herself. Sam was on her umpteenth
circuit through the house, too wired to sit, too fidgity to simply pace. And it
was driving Jane nuts but at the same time, she found it incredibly sweet. Sam
obviously cared for and missed Brooke very deeply. It was plain to see in the
way she watched the windows for a sign of their car, counted the time on her
watch and waited for the turn of the key in the door. </p>
<p>"Sam, honey, after they get home, I'll take Mike in the
kitchen while you tell Brooke that I know about the two of you," Jane suggested.
Sam nodded and Jane was instantly reminded of those dashboard dogs whose heads
bob up and down whenever you hit a bump. </p>
<p>"OK," was the anxious response. "I hope she takes it OK and
doesn't get mad at me." </p>
<p>"I'm sure she'll be fine, hon," Jane reassured her daughter
with a hug. They both jumped when they heard the car pull in the driveway. </p>
<p>"They're home!" Sam exclaimed happily jumping up from the
couch. She beamed from ear to ear and balanced on the balls of her feet. Jane
rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Calm down, Sam, or Mike will guess the second he looks at
you," she told Sam gently. Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she all but whined. "But I've missed her so
much." </p>
<p>"I know you have, but if you don't calm down and keep yourself
from bursting into flames at the mere sight of Brooke, than Mike will know that
something's going on and we'll all have a lot of explaining to do," Sam slumped
back onto the couch. </p>
<p>"I know, I'll try," the doorknob turned and in walked Mike and
Brooke with wide smiles on their faces. </p>
<p>"We're home!" Mike announced as he hugged Jane. Sam got up and
gave both Mike and Brooke quick hugs before sitting back on the couch. She was
afraid that if she hugged Brooke too long she wouldn't let go. And she had felt
the way Brooke ran her hands over her back. Brooke hadn't wanted to let go
either. </p>
<p>"It's so good to see you," Jane said as she saw Brooke's face
out of the corner of her eye. The smile on Brooke's face at seeing Sam could
light up New York for a century, the girl just seemed to glow. And the same look
was mirrored on Sam's face. (How I didn't see it for so long and how Mike
doesn't see it now I'll never understand) she thought to herself. </p>
<p>"Did we miss anything?" Mike asked. Jane shook her head as
Brooke and Sam continued to stare at each other. (Oh, brother) </p>
<p>"No, just the usual, right Sam?" Sam looked away with a slight
blush and nodded. "We did have a small earthquake that scared me and Mac but Sam
slept through the entire thing," Jane laughed remembering the jolt that had
awoken her and the baby a few mornings ago. When she hadn't heard from Sam, she
found her curled up on Brooke's bed, completely oblivious to the entire
incident. It was then that she decided that the two of them really needed to
have a little heart to heart. </p>
<p>"Figures," Brooke scoffed, speaking for the first time since
coming in the door. Seeing Sam for the first time in a week had rendered her
momentarily speechless. "You sleep like the dead, McPherson." Sam stuck out her
tongue. </p>
<p>"Have to with the way you snore, Princess," she shotback. They
were deeply in love with one another and they didn't fight like they used to but
they still tried to keep up the appearance of mild malice between them, even if
it did only come across as friendly fire. Mike sighed. </p>
<p>"There's the two girls I recognize," he joked. "Aren't you the
least bit happy to see each other?" He was answered by two bright smiles.
</p>
<p>"Sure I am, Dad," Brooke responded. </p>
<p>"Me too," Sam confirmed. "but I still need to harass her every
once in a while or I shrivel up and die. Very ugly way to go." </p>
<p>"But oh so tempting," Brooke added. Sam arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Not gonna happen. Too much ammo." Brooke flopped down on the
couch next to Sam but kept a discrete distance between them. </p>
<p>"Mike, I know Mac would like to see you. And Sam and Brooke
have some things they need to talk about so let's give them some time to
themselves, shall we?" Jane advised. Mike followed her out. Brooke watched them
walk out through the kitchen and when she was sure they were gone, she shifted
position so that she was straddling Sam's lap, eliciting a giggle from the other
girl. </p>
<p>"A little brazen, aren't we?" Sam teased as Brooke kept one
eye on the kitchen. </p>
<p>"Can't help it, I feel like I'm going to burst if I don't
touch you, kiss you," Brooke leaned over and kissed Sam lightly on the lips.
"You have no idea how much I needed that," she breathed. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I think I have a fairly good idea," she confided as she
traced her fingers down Brooke's nose and over her soft lips. "I missed you so,
so much. Are they still gone?" Brooke nodded. "Good, c'mere," Sam pulled Brooke
closer and kissed her deeply, passionately, wildly. She felt Brooke moan into
her mouth and almost forgot about who was in the other room. Almost. </p>
<p>"Brooke," she panted when she pulled away. "Brooke, we need to
talk." Sam looked to see Brooke sitting above her, eyes closed, lips slightly
parted and face flushed. Slowly her eyes fluttered open and the considerably
darker hue focused on Sam. </p>
<p>"If we have to. I've been thinking of some more interesting
activities for your mouth, though," Brooke whispered saucily, her voice husky.
Sam's eyes widened as she chuckled. </p>
<p>"Harlot. Maybe later. Oh yeah, definitely later, but this is
serious, Brooke," catching the vibe from Sam, Brooke instantly sobered up. </p>
<p>"What's going on? Everything all right?" Sam swallowed and bit
her lip. </p>
<p>"Mom knows," she blurted out. (Smooth, Sam, real subtle. Nice
job. Give her heart failure why don't you?) She watched as all the color drained
away from Brooke's face and left her lipstick standing out in stark contrast. </p>
<p>"W...what? How? When? W...what?" she stuttered blinking
rapidly in confusion. </p>
<p>"Apparently she figured it out awhile ago on her own. Guess we
aren't very subtle with the smoldering looks and wanton glances. She ambushed me
at breakfast yesterday," Sam explained. </p>
<p>"And you told her?" Brooke asked, her voice several octaves
higher than normal as panic set in. Sam ran her hands up and down Brooke's arms
in an attempt to soothe her. </p>
<p>"After she practically had to heimlick me when I choked on my
Rice Krispies. Trust me, it wasn't my idea." Brooke looked thoughtful for a
second. </p>
<p>"How did she take it?" she asked as she played with a lock of
Sam's brown hair. </p>
<p>"Pretty good since I'm still breathing. Actually, once we got
passed the mutual panic phase, the this-is-not-a-phase-section, the
I-really-love-her confession," Brooke blushed and Sam brushed her cheek with the
back of her hand. "Because I do, you know. Once we got passed all that, we were
able to talk it out. She's a little weirded out about the whole thing but, who
wouldn't be? That's to be expected. I don't think this is covered in 'Mom'
school. I seriously doubt she saw this one coming. It's not everyday that your
daughter falls truly, madly, deeply, head over heels, completely in love with
her stepsister although I think Jerry Springer did an episode on it just last
week." </p>
<p>"Actually I think it was Rikki Lake but I see your point. Oh,
God, she's not in there telling my Dad is she?" Panic set back in on Brooke. </p>
<p>"No, she wants to talk to the two of us first so we can figure
out exactly what we're going to tell him." </p>
<p>"Thank you, God. What are we going to tell him?" Brooke asked
fearfully. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't really know but Mom reassures me that we don't own a
wood chipper," Brooke looked at her in confusion. "Sorry, gory personal joke.
Anyway, we have to tell him sooner or later, preferably sooner so that he
doesn't accidently stumble across us." </p>
<p>"You have a point," Brooke agreed. Sam shifted a little,
accidently causing Brooke to rub harder against her thigh. Brooke moaned a
little loudly. </p>
<p>"Brooke!" Sam hissed in a mild panic as she looked over her
shoulder for any sign of their parents. Brooke didn't move. </p>
<p>"Shhh, I don't think they heard that. It was your fault
anyway," Brooke admonished with a Cheshire cat grin. Sam scowled
unthreateningly. </p>
<p>"You're cutting the circulation off in my legs, silly," she
shifted again. Brooke giggled. </p>
<p>"Oh, move again," she gasped. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"And I thought I was bad. Come home from your trip a little
horny, did you?" Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, a lot horny," she joked. Her face suddenly turned
serious. "Sam, I had a lot of time to think about this, about us." Panic flashed
across Sam's delicate features before Brooke could stop it. </p>
<p>"You have regrets, don't you? Especially now that Mom knows.
Oh God, I knew this was going to happen. What was I thinking? Thinking that you
could ever feel this way for someone like me?" Sam ranted while trying to get
Brooke off of her lap. She desperately wanted to get away from Brooke before she
totally lost it. But Brooke wouldn't let her up. Brooke for one, was very
confused. </p>
<p>She couldn't figure out what the Hell just happened. (When did
she lose control of the conversation? What the Hell was Sam talking about and
where was this insecurity coming from?) </p>
<p>"Brooke, get off me, please," Sam begged, losing her
composure. Brooke sat where she was and placed her arms on either side of Sam's
shoulders on the back of the couch, effectively pinning her in place.
</p>
<p>"Not until you listen to me. You didn't let me finish. God, Sam,
are you really that insecure? I have absolutely no regrets about anything,
especially not about us, about you. You are the one positive thing in my life,
the one good thing that I can look at and say I'm proud of. And what do you mean
`someone like you'? I hope you mean someone beautiful, intellegent, sensitive,
funny?" </p>
<p>"Stop, Brooke, you know what I meant," Sam interrupted her
annoyed. </p>
<p>"No, Sam, I don't. Tell me." </p>
<p>"A have not. How could someone like you, a `have' care for a
`have not'? We learned all about the dangers of rising above your station in
life, Brooke. Maybe I was a fool to think this could work." Brooke leaned closer
into Sam's face. </p>
<p>"Somedays, I wonder who the Hell you are. It's like loving
Miss Jeckyl and Miss Hyde. You pretend to not care what anyone thinks about you
and then you turn around and all you can think about is whether or not anyone
will ever see you as anything other than what you think you are. And you
apparently have pitiously low self-esteem." </p>
<p>"Your point being?" Sam asked curtly. </p>
<p>"Geeze, Sam, my point is that I love you and I have no regrets
about us. Do you understand that?" Sam nodded. "Do you regret us?" </p>
<p>"God, no!" Sam exclaimed. Brooke gave a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>"Good, you scared me for a minute there. Now, that aside, will
you let me finish what I started to say before your little panic attack?" Sam
nodded. "OK then, I was saying that I had a lot of time to think about
everything, us, the sex thing and I came to a lot of realizations. The biggest
being that I love you, Sammy. Truly, deeply and like I never thought it possible
to love another human being." </p>
<p>"When you're not here, Sam, I feel like there's no air in the
room. Without you there's no light in my life and no stars in the sky. Nothing
has any color, no vibrancy and my life is only half lived. But with you by my
side, everything is in bright technicolor; it's loud and alive and I'm alive and
that's all that matters. I need you Sam, to live, to breathe, to exist."
</p>
<p>Sam sat shock still as she listened to Brooke's confession.
She was afraid to speak and break the spell that they had fallen under. Looking
into Brooke's eyes she could only see the honest and raw emotion of what Brooke
was saying looking back at her. </p>
<p>"I feel the same way, Brooke," Brooke lifted a hand and
covered Sam's mouth with it. </p>
<p>"I'm not finished yet," Sam nodded mutely in understanding.
"When I slept with Josh, I did so partially out of obligation. I felt it was
something I had to do because I was his girlfriend for so long, he wanted it and
it was expected of me. I ignored the fact that my heart really told me it wasn't
what I wanted and did it anyway. And once it was over, I knew I'd made a
mistake. Josh and me, we weren't meant to be. I meant it when I told you that
your first time should be with that someone special. And Josh wasn't that
someone for me. It took me a while to realize this, Sam, but that person for me,
is you. Should have been you. " Brooke broke the intense eye contact that the
two had maintained throughout the long oration and looked down, a few tears
falling onto Sam's lap. </p>
<p>"I'm so sorry I didn't wait for you," Brooke cried softly,
causing Sam to cry with her. </p>
<p>"Hey," Sam lifted Brooke's face up to meet her own. "You have
nothing to apologize for. You didn't know this was going to happen, neither of
us did. If someone had told me a year ago that I was going to fall in love with
you and that you would return those feelings, I would have called the men with
the little white coats that tie in the back to come and take them away." Brooke
smiled. </p>
<p>"Cute visual," she laughed. </p>
<p>"Yes it is, but you get my point. Whenever you're ready for
the next step, Brooke, is fine with me. I'll wait. I'll fantasize and you'll
drive me absolutely insane, no doubt?" </p>
<p>"Short trip?" </p>
<p>"Don't help. Where was I? Oh, yeah, whatever is right for you
is right for me. I'm not going to force you into something you're not ready for.
But please know this, Brooke. Sex is not going to destroy our relationship like
it did yours and Josh's. It didn't work with you and Josh because, like you
said, it wasn't meant to be. We are. If, when we have sex, it'll be beautiful,
Brooke, just like you are. And we'll be stronger for it." Brooke hugged her. </p>
<p>"How do you always know just what to say?" </p>
<p>"I'm a writer, it's my job, remember?" Sam joked. </p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. But that's what I wanted to tell you. I think I'm
ready, Sam. For that next step, when you are," Brooke said shyly. Sam's eyes got
wide and then a slow grin spread across her face. </p>
<p>"Well, Mom said we had to behave, you know, no hanky panky
where we might get caught. But I'm sure we can think of something, somewhere
discreet." She leaned up to kiss Brooke. They stayed that way until they heard
Mike and Jane's voices carrying through the kitchen. Brooke scrambled to get off
of Sam and sat in the armchair across from her instead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When their parents walked into the room they looked like the very paragons of
innocence. Although they both looked like they'd been crying, Mike chalked it up
to one of their thankfully infrequent fights. </p>
<p>"Well, Sam, looks like Brooke and I didn't miss much while we
were gone, did we?" Mike asked. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nope, just the same old crap, different day," Sam responded.
Mike yawned. </p>
<p>"Well, I'm tired, that drive always takes a lot out of me so
I'm going to head to bed. Jane?" </p>
<p>"I'm going to stay up and talk to the girls for a while. I'll
be up before too long," Mike nodded and gave her a kiss goodnight. </p>
<p>"All right then, good night everyone." </p>
<p>"Good night, Dad." </p>
<p>"Good night, honey." </p>
<p>"Night Mike." </p>
<p>After Mike went to bed, Jane focused her attention on Brooke. </p>
<p>"I trust that she told you?" Brooke nodded nervously. "Good,
let me tell you a few things young lady," Jane started sternly. Sam and Brooke
exchanged alarmed glances. </p>
<p>"Sam is my firstborn and is very dear to me, I don't think I
need to tell you that Brooke. I don't like to see her hurt. I've seen too many
people who claim to care for her hurt her in the past and I won't stand by and
watch it happen again." When Brooke opened her mouth to protest, Jane held up
her hand to stop her. </p>
<p>"Let me finish. I won't stand by and watch her get her heart
broken again, Brooke. I just won't. But I don't think that it's something I need
to worry about with you, is it?" Brooke shook her head emphatically `no'. "Good,
now that that's clear, let's get some other things straight." </p>
<p>"Sam cares for you, Brooke. In her own words, `you can't
dictate the will of my heart Mom. Time, distance, or death is not going to
change anything.' Pretty heavy stuff, even from Sam. This isn't a game to her
Brooke so it had better not be for you. Is it?" Again Brooke shook her head
`no'. </p>
<p>"OK, now we're getting somewhere. Sam's not the most
emotionally available person on the planet, don't glare at me like that, Sam,
it's the truth. Anyway, Brooke, because of that she finds it hard to express
herself sometimes but please be patient with her. If you could have heard half
of what she told me yesterday, you'd be floored." </p>
<p>"I'm sure I would, Mom. So, aside from the normal amount of
freaking out about this, are you going to be alright with us?" Brooke asked.
Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I think I all ready am. I saw your faces when you came
through that door, Brooke. I love your father but I swear he's a little slow
sometimes. You both absolutely glowed when you laid eyes on one another."
</p>
<p>"I love your daughter, Jane. With everything I am. With more
than words can express," Sam slapped her lightly on the arm. </p>
<p>"You're getting all mushy," Sam protested as she wiped away a
few stray tears. "It's embarassing." Brooke rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Get over it, McPherson. Seriously, how are we going to tell
my Dad?" Jane shrugged. </p>
<p>"I have no idea. He has some pretty antiquated ideas when it
comes to things like this no matter how hip and with it he tries to act. He
might not take it well." </p>
<p>"Hence my sudden pathological fear of wood chippers," Sam
mumbed under her breath. </p>
<p>"For the last time, he is not going to kill you and throw your
remains in a wood chipper, Sam," Jane sighed. Brooke scrunched up her nose. </p>
<p>"Ew, Sam. Ew. How could you even think that?" </p>
<p>"Because we don't have snowblowers in California?" This earned
her double smacks from her mom and Brooke. "What?" </p>
<p>"So what should we tell him?" Brooke asked, bringing the
conversation back on topic. </p>
<p>"The truth, however painful," Sam suggested seriously. At the
two dubious looks, she shrugged. "Look, it's like this; either we come right out
and tell him `Hi, Mike, Brooke and I are gay and oh, look, in love with each
other'. Or he finds out by accident by walking in while we're kissing or
something, which is bound to happen no matter how careful we are. Or he finds
out from one of our friends when we get around to telling them. Eventually
someone is going to let the cat out of the bag and the shit will hit the fan.
It's that simple. Plus, if he finds out Mom knows and didn't tell him it might
destroy that relationship. God, we're damned if we do, damned if we don't, huh?" </p>
<p>"Looks that way," Brooke conceeded. Jane agreed. </p>
<p>"Afraid so. Let's give him a few days to settle in and then
we'll tell him. Until then, be careful you two. I'm not saying live like a pair
of nuns, but don't be obvious either. I think it'll be worse if he figures it
out on his own and we didn't tell him." Sam and Brooke nodded their agreement. </p>
<p>"So, a few days then?" Sam asked. </p>
<p>"Yes, until then, I'm going to bed. Good night you two." Jane
got up and headed to her bedroom. </p>
<p>"Good night Mom," Brooke called. </p>
<p>"Night Mom," Sam echoed. Brooke got up and sat next to Sam
after Jane left and played with the girls' long brown locks. </p>
<p>"Whatcha thinking about?" she asked as she twirled a few
strands around her fingers. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"How complicated our lives have become. And how tired you must
be from your long trip." She sighed dramatically. "And here I am wide awake with
all this extra energy." Brooke tsked her. </p>
<p>"Aw, Sammy, that's too bad. We really should find something
for you to do with all that extra energy," Brooke cooed, leaning into Sam's ear
and nibbling gently. Sam shivered. </p>
<p>"Hmmm? Any ideas?" Sam asked innocently. "Cards, Monopoly,
Parcheesi?" </p>
<p>"I had a much, much more physical activity in mind," Brooke
whispered huskily. Sam turned her head and grinned at her. Brooke decided that
that grin in particular was very sultry. It made her blood boil and her heart
race. </p>
<p>"A rousing game of Twister?" Sam offered. </p>
<p>"Only if they make an X-rated version, beautiful." </p>
<p>"I think we'd better move this to one of our bedrooms unless
you want to give the neighbors a show," Sam suggested, her voice just as husky
and her eyes full of hunger. Brooke nodded and stood up while offering Sam her
hand. </p>
<p>"Let's," she said as she silently led Sam up the stairs. </p>
