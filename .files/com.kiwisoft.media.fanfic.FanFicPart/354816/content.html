<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 26 -->

<p>"Need a lift home?" Brooke asked, stopping beside Sam who was impatiently shoving books into her locker.</p>
<p>"Thanks" Sam replied gratefully, as she slammed the door shut, "but I've got a meeting for the newspaper now". </p>
<p>"Are you nervous?" Brooke inquired gently, walking beside her.</p>
<p>"Why would I be?" Sam responded, faking ignorance. </p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know, maybe because this is the first time you'll be in direct contact with your ex boyfriend?" Brooke answered, a touch sarcastically. </p>
<p>"He's not going" Sam replied, curtly.</p>
<p>"He told you this?" Brooke asked, as they stopped in front of the class room door.</p>
<p>"He told Jessie this" Sam answered, the hurt clearly visible on her face. "He still won't look at me, let alone talk to me".</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Sam" Brooke replied sympathetically, pulling the brunette into a hug. </p>
<p>"I know he's upset but it still hurts" Sam admitted tearfully. "I miss him".</p>
<p>"He'll come around eventually" Brooke replied, pulling away slightly to offer her best comforting smile. "If Josh and I can remain close friends, I don't see why you two can't."</p>
<p>Sam smiled at Brooke's optimism. "I hope so."</p>
<p>"I'm always right" Brooke replied haughtily "despite a certain someone, whose name I shall not mention, Samantha McPherson, who always, but unsuccessfully tries to prove me wrong on many an occassion".</p>
<p>Sam laughed, slapping the blonde on the arm.</p>
<p>"And who also has a worrying tendency for violence" Brooke continued with a cheeky grin, ducking away as Sam tried to hit her again. </p>
<p>"I'm the one with the tendency for violence?" Sam asked increduously, pointing to herself. "Do you know that everybody thinks I punched him?"</p>
<p>Brooke shot her a guilty look. </p>
<p>"I know, I'm sorry, but at least the guys won't mess with you now" Brooke replied, once again looking at the bright side of things. "With your mean right hook and all..."</p>
<p>Narrowing her eyes at the blonde, Sam lunged at her, laughing as they began to playfully wrestle in the corridor. </p>
<p>"It's nice to see that the students of today are making productive use of their time" Glass commented sarcastically, inwardly amused as the two girls froze in the exact position she found them in; Sam holding Brooke in a gentle headlock with Brooke's arms wrapped around the brunette's waist. </p>
<p>Jumping apart, they cast sheepish looks towards their Biology teacher.</p>
<p>"I have a meeting" Sam informed her hastily. "For the newspaper".</p>
<p>"I was just, um, uh...." Brooke tried to explain, looking to Sam for help.</p>
<p>"Never mind Brooke" Glass interrupted, knowing exactly why she was there. She walked past them but stopped several feet away, turning around once more. </p>
<p>"Ladies?"</p>
<p>"Yes?" Brooke asked cautiously. </p>
<p>"Get a clue". </p>
<p>And with that Glass walked away, leaving Sam and Brooke standing there in utter confusion.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Sam finally asked, turning towards Brooke.</p>
<p>"My sentiments exactly" she replied with a confused shrug. </p>
<p>Sam gestured towards the door, pushing all thoughts of Bio Glass out of her mind. </p>
<p>"I better get inside" she said reluctantly, picking up her bag. "I'll see you when I get home".</p>
<p>Brooke nodded, trying to hide her disappointment. "Sure".</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam called out, as Brooke started to leave. "Thanks".</p>
<p>"Your welcome" the cheerleader replied with a grin, before she disappeared around the corner. </p>
<p>It had been two weeks since her separation from Alex, and Sam wondered what good she had done to deserve having someone like Brooke in her life. The blonde had done everything right, holding her as she cried when Alex continued to ignore her, making her laugh when she desperately needed cheering up. She was always there, and Sam knew that her feelings for Brooke were spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>Her recent leap back into singledom had almost stripped away any self restraint she had when it came to the blonde, her emotions climbing closer and closer to the surface, and no matter how hard she tried to keep some sense of distance between them, one look into Brooke's eyes shattered any determination she had.</p>
<p>Sam couldn't keep away and she decided she wasn't going to try anymore.</p>
<p>Sighing happily, Sam walked into the room, finding Jessie typing away furiously at the computer. Placing her bag on the nearest table, she walked over and sat beside her.</p>
<p>"Hey Jess" Sam greeted, "Where is everybody?'</p>
<p>"David had a dentist appointment, Sarah is sick with the flu and Alex..." Jessie stopped, casting Sam an uncomfortable look.</p>
<p>"I guess the meeting's cancelled then" Sam stated, trying to change the subject.</p>
<p>Jessie shrugged. "I'm working on some stuff, you're most welcome to join me".</p>
<p>"I think I will" Sam replied, switching on the computer. She had been spending so much time with Brooke, it had been some time since she had worked on some of her articles.</p>
<p>"I need to get some stuff from my locker" Jessie explained, as she stood up. "I'll be back in a moment, okay?".</p>
<p>Sam nodded absently, watching after her thoughtfully. </p>
<p>Rumours ran rife at Kennedy High, where gossip was considered an art, and it was a common sight for students, and even teachers, to place a bet or two with Sugar Daddy, who ran a not so secret gambling service based on the possible outcomes of a wide variety of conjecture.</p>
<p>Some of the more popular bets included "Mary Cherry will spend the rest of her life in a psychiatric facility", odds 2-1, which Sam herself had placed a significant amount of money on, to "Bio Glass is actually an alien from another planet", odds 10-1. </p>
<p>Sam smiled at her personal favourite: </p>
<p>Brooke and, or Sam, will be charged with attempted murder by the end of the school day.</p>
<p>In the early, turbulent stages of their relationship, bets were placed every school morning by the majority of students, the odds consistently around the 5-1 range. It still didn't stop some from parting with their money despite the now common knowledge Sam and Brooke had reached a permanent truce. Looking up at the sound of the door knob turning, Sam smiled as the popular old janitor lumbered in. </p>
<p>"Don't mind me, little lady" he said with a smile, which displayed his many missing teeth. </p>
<p>"No problem, Bob" she answered kindly, turning back to her computer.</p>
<p>Wondering where Jessie had disappeared too, Sam wondered whether the rumours about her friend were true. Was Jessie a lesbian? Apparently, Jessie had been seen at the local video store renting Kissing Jessica Stein.</p>
<p>Shaking her head ruefully, Sam couldn't believe how stupid the reason was that started the rumour in the first place, yet it didn't stop her from wondering. On the extremely rare occasion Sam wasn't thinking of Brooke, old thoughts began to resurface about her own sexuality, and this time she confronted them. </p>
<p>Was she gay? Bi-sexual? A heterosexual who just happened to be in love with the one girl? If she couldn't be with Brooke, would she date another guy? Another girl? </p>
<p>Did it really matter? </p>
<p>Thinking of Alex, Sam knew that she found him attractive. He was handsome, intelligent and a genuinely nice guy, yet she felt no passion for him, no fire. Their heavy petting sessions had resulted in nothing but a nice tingle spreading through out her body. She knew, from reading fan fiction, that there had to be more than that. </p>
<p>She hoped that there was more to it than that.</p>
<p>Sam wondered if it were at all possible to fall unconscious from a mind blowing orgasm, since she had come across that several times when reading stories online. Glancing sideaways, she momentarily considered asking Bob, but decided not to. </p>
<p><i>He'd probably consider it an invitation to try</i>, Sam thought with a smirk. Turning towards the door, she watched as Jessie came walking in.</p>
<p>"Here you go" she said, handing Sam a can of soft drink while opening her own.</p>
<p>"Thanks" Sam replied appreciatively with a grin. "I was wondering where you had gotten to".</p>
<p>"See you later girls" Bob said with a wave, as he headed out the door.</p>
<p>"Bye Bob" Jessie replied with a grin before she turned to Sam and laughed. "Isn't he just the cutest thing? I want to pinch his cheeks!"</p>
<p>Sam made no comment as she stared at Jessie thoughtfully. Shifting uncomfortably in her seat, Jessie waved her hands in front of Sam's face, hoping to gain the brunette's attention.</p>
<p>"Sorry" Sam apologized sheepishly, snapping out of her haze. "I zoned out for a minute".</p>
<p>"I noticed" Jessie commented, wryly. "Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was..." Sam stopped and regarded her silently for a moment. "Can I ask you a personal question? I mean, you don't have to answer, of course, but if you decide to, I promise it will stay between you and me, but if you feel uncomfortable...."</p>
<p>"Sam, just ask already" Jessie interrupted with an amused look. </p>
<p>"Um, well there, are rumours about you and..." Sam faltered, not sure whether to continue.</p>
<p>"Are you asking if I'm a lesbian?" Jessie asked frankly, a slight smile on her lips. "Did you place a bet?"</p>
<p>"What?! No! Of course not!" Sam exclaimed, before she realised that Jessie was joking. She shot her an embarrassed look. "You ass, I thought I offended you just then!"</p>
<p>"Would you believe, with all the talk that's gone on, you are the first person to ask me?"</p>
<p>"You're kidding?" Sam asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"I'm like Kennedy High's version of the Xena subtext debate" Jessie explained wryly, before she put on a dramatic voice. "Is she, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"And to answer your question" Jessie continued, "Xena and Gabrielle definitely are..."</p>
<p>Sam grinned as she nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"And yes, I am" Jessie finished casually.</p>
<p>"Do you care if people know?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"My close friends and family already do" Jessie replied with a shrug "and if anyone were to ask me I wouldn't deny it, but I'm not going to yell it from the roof top". </p>
<p>Jessie watched Sam for a moment. "Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"Just wondering" Sam replied as casually as she could, blushing as Jessie smirked at her knowingly.</p>
<p>"Why Ms McPherson, are you asking me out on a date?" she joked, laughing as Sam gazed at her with wide eyes. "I'm just kidding, relax".</p>
<p>Sam smiled at her sheepishly. "Sorry, it's just..."</p>
<p>"You've been wondering whether you are" Jessie finished for her. She smiled. "It's okay, Sam, you can talk to me. It'll stay between us, I promise."</p>
<p>"How did you know?" Sam asked intently. "How can you be sure?"</p>
<p>Jessie shrugged. "Guys don't do it for me. I've kissed a few and it just, it didn't feel right, you know? I can look at a guy and say he's attractive but I've never really been attracted to them. There's a difference". </p>
<p>Jessie blushed. </p>
<p>"You also get a clue when you've been in love with your best friend your entire life".</p>
<p>"You're in love with Sarah?" Sam asked, shocked. "Since when?"</p>
<p>"Since always" Jessie admitted, before she shook her head sadly. "Why is it that we always fall for the straight ones?"</p>
<p>"Tell me about it" Sam muttered. Noticing that Jessie was staring at her, Sam cringed as she realised what she just said.</p>
<p>"Who is the lucky girl then?" Jessie asked once she recovered from the shock, leaning forward in anticipation. "It's why you broke up with Alex, isn't it?</p>
<p>Sam nodded reluctantly. </p>
<p>"It's okay, Sam" Jessie said, placing a comforting hand on her arm "you don't have to tell me".</p>
<p>"Thanks" Sam replied gratefully.</p>
<p>"Can I have three guesses?" Jessie asked hopefully, after several moments.</p>
<p>Sam stared.</p>
<p>"How about twenty questions?" Jessie continued.</p>
<p>Sam raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"How about you draw me a diagram?"</p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Hang the butcher?" Jessie pleaded, making Sam laugh. "Come on Sam, I won't tell anyone, the suspense is killing me!"</p>
<p>"You can have one guess" Sam allowed with a smile, amused at Jessie's begging and confident in her inability to guess Brooke's name. "Who do you think it is?"</p>
<p>"Brooke" Jessie replied immediately.</p>
<p>"WHAT?!" Sam yelled, standing up. </p>
<p>"Oh come on!" Jessie snickered, pulling Sam back into her seat. "It wasn't that hard".</p>
<p>"How?" Sam asked, genuinely confused. "Am I that obvious?"</p>
<p>"All that yelling and fighting you two had going on?" Jessie asked rhetorically. "Can anyone say sexual tension?" </p>
<p>Sam stared.</p>
<p>"It might not be obvious to Kennedy High's heterosexual society, but this lil lesbian's gay dar went ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding!" Jessie continued, amused as Sam's mouth continued to drop.</p>
<p>"Besides it was a simple process of elimination. Carmen? Lily? I don't think so. Nicole? Mary Cherry? Don't make me laugh" Jessie said, shaking her head at the thought. "And of course, Alex, look wise, is practically a male version of Brooke. Hello? If anyone gave it two seconds thought, they'd slap themselves silly for not realizing themselves. Then again, this school is filled with blind, self obsessed, ignorant freaks, so your secret should be pretty safe".</p>
<p>"You're good" Sam commented finally.</p>
<p>"Yes. I am" Jessie replied with a smirk. They watched each other for a moment, before they burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"It's nice to finally say it out loud to someone" Sam admitted with a smile.</p>
<p>"You should tell her" Jessie said, almost certain that Brooke returned Sam's feelings. She was rarely ever wrong about these things.</p>
<p>"You kidding me?" Sam asked, horrified at the thought. "And make a fool of myself?"</p>
<p>"Take the risk Sam" Jessie urged, leaning forward.</p>
<p>"Only if you tell Sarah how you feel" Sam challenged, with a smirk.</p>
<p>Jessie stared at her then leant back, throwing her hands up in defeat. "Damn it".</p>
<p>"Exactly" Sam replied with a laugh. "Easier said than done".</p>
<p>Shaking her head ruefully, Jessie glanced at her wrist watch, letting out a gasp.</p>
<p>"My god, it's five!" She exclaimed, standing up. "I told Sarah I'd be at her place around four thirty". She stopping, glaring momentarily. "I promised her we'd have a Freddie Prince Junior marathon. Do you have any idea how much I hate his movies? If she wasn't sick...."</p>
<p>"Awww, how sweet" Sam teased, packing up her things. </p>
<p>"Shut it, you" Jessie said embarrassed, before she grinned. "What can I say, I'm whipped".</p>
<p>"Tell Sarah, I hope she gets better soon, okay?" Sam requested, placing her bag on her shoulder. Jessie nodded in response, walking over to Sam until she was within arms distance.</p>
<p>"Have you ever kissed a girl?" She asked softly.</p>
<p>Sam shook her head, as she felt her heart begin to race.</p>
<p>"It's nice" Jessie commented, before adding sheepishly "You know, I've always had a little thing for you."</p>
<p>"You have?" Sam asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Jessie nodded, before she quickly covered the remaining distance between them and gently pressed her lips against Sam's, pulling away after several moments.</p>
<p>"That was....nice" Sam replied, with a smile.</p>
<p>"I told you" Jessie managed to get out before Sam kissed her again, this time with increasing urgency. Placing her hands on the brunette's waist, Jessie frowned as she heard someone enter the room.</p>
<p>"Sam, are you..."</p>
<p>They jumped apart, finding Brooke leaning back against the doorway, gaping at them. Nobody moved as they glanced at each other uncomfortably. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I thought that, I'm sorry..." Brooke mumbled incoherently before she rushed out.</p>
