<p>A/N: I'm sorry it took so long. I actually wrote it about a week ago, but it took me a while to get it typed up.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I think this has probably been the worst day of my life.</p>
<p>First off, I couldn't sleep last night. I'd stayed up thinking about what had happened with Miley. I had no idea what I was going to say to her when I saw her. I'd have to talk to her eventually seeing as we had four classes together, but I didn't know what I'd do when the time came to say something.</p>
<p>I walked to school early (to avoid running into Miley and Oliver, I usually walk with them). I went to my first period class and sat there waiting for the bell to ring but kind of hoping it wouldn't because Miley sits next to me in this class. She sits next to me in all the classes I have with her. I never would've thought that would be a bad thing until today.</p>
<p>Eventually the bell did ring. I waited for Miley to walk in and for the unavoidable conversation I would have to have with her, but she never showed up. She'd skipped out on school. Why hadn't I thought of that?</p>
<p>Anyway, I listened to my teacher drone on about some equation (I probably should've paid attention. It seemed kind of important) then went to second period. Still no Miley. While I was relieved beyond belief that I wouldn't have to deal with her just yet, part of me was sad that I wouldn't see her today. I mean, she's still my best friend.</p>
<p>That's a big part of why I didn't want to talk about what I'd read in her diary. I was scared I'd lose her if we talked about it. We'd never be able to go back to the way we were with me knowing how she feels about me. There would always be this awkwardness between the two of us. Then again, if I never talk to her, we definitely wouldn't be able to patch things up.</p>
<p>I barely paid attention through my next two classes. Then lunch came around and I sat where I usually sit, except today, I was alone and not really in the mood to eat anything.</p>
<p>"Okay, what the hell is going on?"</p>
<p>Oliver's voice came from behind me and scared me half to death.</p>
<p>"Geez Ollie! Ever think about warning a person before you sneak up on them!"</p>
<p>Oliver sat down and started eating lunch. Apparently today was pizza day.</p>
<p>"Just answer the question Lilly."</p>
<p>"What question?" I always play dumb when I know I'm about to have a conversation I don't want to have.</p>
<p>"Ugh," Oliver said in frustration. "What's going on with you and Miley?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I mean Miley called me crying last night saying something happened and that you hate her and that she wasn't coming to school today."</p>
<p>That's when my heart sank into my stomach. She thinks I hate her? I could never hate her. She's the most important person in my life.</p>
<p>"So," Oliver continued, "are you gonna tell me what's going on?"</p>
<p>I didn't know if I should tell him. It wasn't really my business to tell. Hell, I shouldn't even know.</p>
<p>"I have no idea what she was talking about."</p>
<p>I really need to get better at lying.</p>
<p>"Lilly come on. There's obviously something going on. I'm not stupid."</p>
<p>"I never said you were stupid, I just don't wanna talk about this Oliver."</p>
<p>"But there's something to talk about?" Oliver asked with a triumphant grin on his face.</p>
<p>"Shut up!" I couldn't think of a better comeback.</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to help."</p>
<p>"You can't help!" I snapped at him. "It's none of your business so just leave me alone!" I started crying. If I kept screwing up, I wasn't going to have any friends left.</p>
<p>"Lilly, I don't know what's going on, but you and Miley are my best friends and you're both hurting right now. I just wanna know why."</p>
<p>I couldn't keep it from him anymore. Besides the fact that I sort of have problems keeping secrets to myself, he's also my best friend and I've never been able to lie to him.</p>
<p>"Fine." I took a deep breath and continued. "I went to Miley's house yesterday. She went to get something and I sorta found her diary…and read it."</p>
<p>"Oh," Oliver said. "That's not that bad."</p>
<p>"Wait, it gets better. The thing is…" I didn't know how to say it, so I just blurted it out. "Miley's gay and she's in love with me."</p>
<p>Oliver choked on his pizza. It took two minutes of patting his back and calming him down to respond.</p>
<p>"Oh my God! Really?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, apparently she's always had a thing for me."</p>
<p>"Wow," he said shocked. "I wasn't expecting that."</p>
<p>"Yeah, me either."</p>
<p>"I mean, I always knew you had the hots for her, but I never would've guessed the feelings were mutual."</p>
<p>"Yeah…wait, what?" Had I just heard him right?</p>
<p>"What? I'm just saying it's cool that you're both into each other."</p>
<p>"Oliver, I'm not into Miley."</p>
<p>Oliver rolled his eyes. "Lilly, it's okay. I don't care."</p>
<p>"I don't care if you care or not. I don't like Miley that way. She's just a friend."</p>
<p>"Oh come on!" Oliver chuckled and continued. "You've never had a boyfriend, you always talk about Miley and how nice she is and how cute she is and on and on and on. I always catch you checking her out when you don't think anyone's looking. You barely even talked to me when Miley and I were going out. It wasn't hard to put the pieces together."</p>
<p>I just looked at him like he was crazy. I couldn't believe it. Oliver thought I had feelings for Miley. That's insane!</p>
<p>Isn't it?</p>
<p>I skipped out on the rest of school. Oliver tried to follow me, but he got caught by a teacher on the way out. I've been sitting on my bed for the last two hours freaking out. How could Oliver think I like Miley like that? Okay, so it's true I haven't really had a boyfriend or talked about boys but so what? Lots of girls have better things to do than obsess over boys. That doesn't exactly make me a lesbian.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most 17-year-old girls have had at least one crush in their lifetime. I really haven't. I don't know, boys are just sort of…there. And yeah, I do tend to notice when girls' skirts are just a little shorter than they were supposed to be…especially when it was Miley.</p>
<p>Plus, Oliver was right about me not liking the two of them together. It never seemed right to me. But why had I hated it so much? Was it because I didn't like being the third wheel or was it because I wished I was the one holding her hand and hugging her and kissing her…</p>
<p>No! I'm not gay! I would know if I was a lesbian wouldn't I? I mean, it wouldn't just sneak up on me like this. I would've noticed if I'd fallen for my best friend. That's a pretty big thing to miss. She's like a sister to me…a very attractive sister who I occasionally dream about. Okay, that sounded so creepy. Whatever, dreams don't mean anything…do they? Ugh! This is all too damn confusing!</p>
<p>I need to talk to Miley and get this all sorted out.</p>
