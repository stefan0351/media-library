<!-- About a Girl \ Part 3 -->

<p><u><i>A week later - School</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie flung her math text into the locker, dragging out an even  bigger biology text shoving it into her backpack.  Then, dropping the  now obscenely heavy bag to the floor she reached back and closed her  locker, bending down to pick up her bag when she caught sight of a  familiar figure in the distance.  Leaving the backpack where it was  she leaned back against her locker and stared down the hallway.</p>

<p>She could just make out Katie's face in between the bodies of the  people who were surrounding her.  Katie was shaking her head  emphatically about something and poking at one of the people standing  in front of her rhythmically.  Jessie smiled as she watched the  scene, thinking that she wouldn't have wanted to be the person Katie  was jabbing at.  But mostly, she just watched her friend and let the  feelings that she had now come to associate with Katie wash over  her.  She knew that she was attracted to Katie; there was no denying  that after what happened in her room.  In fact, after what happened  in her room she hadn't wanted to deny it anymore because it had just  felt so good, so right.  It was like as soon as their lips had  touched this huge weight had been lifted off of her shoulders.  It  was like coming home after a really long drive.</p>

<p>And as she stood there, she let her eyes wander around the hall,  looking at the various students as they passed her.  She'd been doing  that a lot since the day at the attic, looking at other people,  trying to figure it out.  What she was?  What wanting to be with  Katie made her?  But she couldn't, because while she looked, while  she thought some people were more attractive than others, and that  some guys were attractive and some girls were attractive, it didn't  really mean anything.  She didn't really feel anything.  Because  whether she meant to or not, her mind always compared them to Katie  and that meant that there was no comparison.  Because nobody came  close, nobody stood a chance next to Katie.</p>

<p>"You know, the law has a word for what you're doing," Grace whispered  sidling up behind Jessie.  "It's called stalking."</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked turning around to face her stepsister, her head  almost knocking into her still open locker door as she turned  around.  Where had she come from? Jessie wondered carefully shutting  the door before she could hurt herself.</p>

<p> "You know with the intensity you do that it could be an Olympic  sport," Grace continued remembering the concentrated look Jessie had  had on her face as she stared down the hall at Katie.  "Barring that  it could at least make it onto ESPN."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Jessie responded turning  her head away as she felt herself start to blush.</p>

<p>Grace leaned toward Jessie after that comment, her voice lowering  secretively.   "I'm talking about your love connection with Claire  Standish over there," knowing that Jessie knew that she knew what was  going on between her and Katie.  After that afternoon in the attic,  when she had turned to see Jessie staring up at the ceiling  all `sunshine, lollipops and rainbows everything', there hadn't been  doubt in her mind as to what had happened.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked turning around to face Grace again.  "With who?"</p>

<p>"God, you are so young," Grace responded shaking her head at Jessie's  ignorance of everything John Hughes.  "You and Katie," Grace  clarified smiling lecherously.</p>

<p>"Right, well.  I gotta get to class," Jessie responded shooting Grace  one last glare before heading off down the hall.</p>

<p>"If it's any consolation, I thought it was cute," Grace called after  her still smiling.  This was going to be great, she'd have material  for months.</p>

<p><u><i>A few weeks later - Karen's House</i></u></p>

<p>Katie drew her knees up to her chest, resting her chin on top of her  knees and tilted her head slightly to watch Jessie as the other girl  read off a sheet of paper.  She was suppose to be listening so that  she could give Jessie her opinion on it, but the truth was she was  having trouble concentrating.  Her mind kept drifting, shifting to  contemplate the girl sitting in front of her and what exactly their  relationship was.  She knew how she felt about Jessie, she'd known  for a while that she was seriously falling for the girl, and if she  hadn't already fallen, then she was sure she was only like days from  it.  The problem was she didn't know where Jessie was with them, with  anything.  She knew that Jessie liked her, was attracted to her, but  she didn't know what that meant to Jessie or how it changed their  relationship to her, beyond the obvious advantage of getting to make  out.  Which was a considerable advantage, but still not conclusive.</p>

<p>She wanted to ask, to say something, to have a conversation.  She'd  practiced how to start things off a million times pacing around her  room, or talking in the shower.  She even worked out a whole system  of contingency conversations and branch patterns of inquisition.  But  every time she went to say something, she just couldn't do it.  She'd  look at Jessie, and the girl would smile at her, or say something,  and then she just couldn't get the words past her lips.  She was  afraid, afraid that if she pushed she'd end up pushing Jessie away  and she just couldn't risk that.  But she wanted to know.  She wanted  to know so badly.  It was like trying to scratch an itch through a  snowsuit.</p>

<p>"It sounds great," Katie said softly lifting her head up.  "Of course  I didn't understand half of it," she continued smiling.</p>

<p>"You had this class last year," Jessie responded smiling at her  teasingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I had Mrs. Franklin.  Mrs. Franklin," Katie responded  emphasizing the teacher's name.  She was notorious around the school  for being the absolute worst teacher ever in the history of  man.  "And if that isn't bad enough, Maureen Adams sat next to me and  we used to spend the whole class discussing Frankie's latest fashion  disaster," she continued shaking her head.  "We were such bitches."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you weren't," Jessie replied gently, swiveling in her chair  to get a better look at Katie whose head was back resting on her  knees.</p>

<p>"That's sweet," Katie responded cocking an eyebrow up at her.   "But  we were.  However," she continued some life returning to her  voice.  "I did learn enough to know that your essay is great.  There  are fourth years that can't use existentialist in a sentence.  Hell,  Mrs. Peters probably doesn't know how to use it in a sentence.   You're so going to kill," she finished smiling at Jessie proudly.</p>

<p>Jessie held Katie's gaze for a moment then looked down at her paper,  and back at Katie again, a tentative smile working it's way across  her face as she let out a relieved sigh.  Turning her head to the  side she followed Katie as the girl crawled across the floor until  she was kneeling in front of Jessie's chair.  Jessie looked down at  her as Katie gazed up at her, noting Katie's serious expression with  a touch of concern.</p>

<p>"You know I…" Katie began slowly before trailing off, her eyes losing  focus as her attention turned inside for a moment.  Jessie watched as  a myriad of expressions flowed across her fine features, her eyes  crinkling at the sides as she frowned momentarily before focusing on  Jessie again with a deflated sigh.  "It's just … my mom always says  that when we feel something strongly we should share it," she said  starting up again though her eyes still seemed to be looking at  something beyond Jessie.  "Which is ironic since sharing my strong  feeling on how she looked like a brothel worker the night of her  Christmas party got me grounded for a week," she continued her lips  curving up momentarily before thinning out again.  "But, I mean, what  I really wanted to say, is just that … just how much you, our  friendship means to me.  Cause you're like the best thing that's  happened to me since walking, and that's only cause I needed walking  to be able to get over to you," she went on dropping her head down as  she felt tears begin to well up in her eyes.  For some reason she  just didn't want Jessie to see her cry tonight.</p>

<p>"Katie?" Jessie asked softly her hand reaching out to touch the other  girl's cheek.  She was amazingly touched by the words Katie had just  spoken to her, and surprised yet happy by the intensity with which  they were spoken, but at the same time Katie's demeanor was beginning  to worry her.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," Katie said looking up at Jessie, flashing her a quick  smile.  "Really.  I just wanted you to know," she continued her eyes  drifting off to the side.</p>

<p>Jessie continued to watch her for a moment after that, thinking about  what she could do since there was obviously something bothering  Katie, but before she could open her mouth to begin, Katie's eyes had  returned to her, and she was leaning up bringing their lips  together.</p>

<p>The kiss was slow, and tender and beautiful, and Jessie leaned  forward prolonging the contact between them, absorbing the emotions  pouring into her through Katie's lips.  And then it was gone; Katie  had pulled back and was standing up.</p>

<p>"I've gotta go," Katie said softly when Jessie's eyes finally opened  and turned to look up at her.  "It's late."</p>

<p>Jessie turned her head to the side to glance at the clock beside her  bed, and noticed somewhat sadly that it was late.  She didn't want  Katie to leave, especially now that she was sure that something was  bothering her, but Katie was right, she had to be going home.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie replied, not quite able to keep the disappointment out  of her voice.  "I'll walk you out," she continued grasping Katie's  hand.  Katie glanced down at their joined hands and smiled at her,  and then they headed for the door.</p>
