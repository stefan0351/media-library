<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Seventeen -->

<p>Andrea was so worried; she stood pacing in front of Cassidy's building. She'd been knocking on her door for the past hour and a half, and decided to wait out front until Cassidy returned; she had left her own key that last day they'd been together. She kept running nervous hands through her hair; she was so worried and scared. She'd seen the way Cassidy looked after not seeing her all that time, and it was not good. She knew Cassidy was doing something unhealthy, and she wanted to stop her. But she didn't know where to find her.</p>
		<p>Andrea leaned against her car, staring up at the building. She tried to see any sign of movement inside Cassidy's window, thinking that maybe Cassidy was trying to avoid her. But no, there was nothing. She stood helplessly outside, feeling tears filling her eyes. She wondered why Cassidy was doing this to her, to herself, when they could just fall into each other's arms and be happy together. She loved Cassidy so much, was so in love with her. She was suffering. She didn't care if Cassidy didn't feel the same way towards her; she'd be willing to try to win her heart in any way she could.</p>
		<p>A movement caught her eye to her left, and she turned her eyes to the source. Cassidy. Stumbling up the block, trying to hold her own self up with a hand grabbing at fences, her feet dragged one after the other; her body leaned heavily against the fences. She was struggling noisily for breath, her eyelids fluttering, eyes rolling; she held a hand to her chest, grasping her shirt tightly, pulling at it. Andrea could see the sweat gathered thickly all over her forehead, could see the struggle to stay upright. A struggle that she was loosing.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy!" Andrea cried out as she ran to her side, and noticed with dismay the white powder lingering around her nostrils. "Oh God, no!"</p>
		<p>"Andy?" Cassidy whispered brokenly. Then her eyes rolled in their sockets, and she tipped forward, falling to the cement, face forward with a loud thud.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy!" Andrea screamed, shaking her by the shoulder. She flipped her over and was horrified to see that the area around her lips was blue, a sign that she was already not breathing. With a cry, Andrea reached into her purse for her cellular and dialed 9-1-1.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Within minutes, an ambulance was there; the paramedics were working over Cassidy. They'd resuscitated her and were now readying her for a quick transportation to the hospital.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat nearby, sobbing desperately into the shoulder of a female neighbor of Cassidy's.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ashleigh, Robie, Gretchen and George sat having a very early breakfast in a nearby restaurant. Gretchen was telling them what she'd seen in the bar, when Cassidy had run out on Andrea. They'd been there, waiting to hear from Andrea about Cassidy. Robie stared at the table pensively, while the others talked quietly. Around a mouthful of egg sandwich, George said with finality: "Let's go to Cassidy's place, we're wasting time here."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh agreed and all four women stood up, while at the same time George signaled for the ticket. The ring of Ashleigh's cellular telephone jarred them momentarily. Crisply, Ashleigh answered. "We have one of your patients here, Doctor Simmons." A nurse at her hospital replied after introducing herself. "Not in very good condition, ma'am. Critical."</p>
		<p>"Name?" Ashleigh demanded, dread a bad feeling at the pit of her full stomach. She was already striding out of the restaurant, Robie and Gretchen following; George remained behind to pay the bill.</p>
		<p>The nurse remained impersonal; the sound of shuffling papers annoying as she looked for the name. "The name is Cassidy Monsignor." She finally answered.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh's step faltered, and she tried to remain matter of fact. "Give me details." She ordered, her voice thick, unlocking the doors to her black Saab quickly, climbing in.</p>
		<p>The nurse reported, reading from the papers: "Overdose on Cocaine, was brought in after a pulmonary arrest?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh closed her eyes against the anxiety the report conjured, one hand gripping the steering wheel tightly. Gretchen and Robie knew something was up, and they didn't allow her to close her door yet. George had joined them and demanded to know what was going on. As the nurse finished her report, Ashleigh said: "Ill be there in ten minutes." And hung up, looking up at her friends with expressionless eyes. "Get in." She instructed softly.</p>
		<p>"What is it?" Gretchen demanded, while at the same time all of them were climbing into the black Saab, George in the front and the rest in the back.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh started the car, and drove quickly out of the restaurant's parking lot. She remained quiet, concentrating on the road. "Ashleigh," George said softly. "Tell us what's going on. Is it Cassidy?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded slowly, and bit her lower lip. "She's in the hospital again." She said wearily, shaking her head slowly, hearing Gretchen's breath catch from behind her. "Overdosed on coke."</p>
		<p>A sudden outburst from George startled them all; she pounded on the headboard wildly, cursing. Suddenly, she stopped, staring out the windshield. "Damn it!" She yelled, pounding again on the headboard. "Is she alive?" She asked, suddenly calm, slouching on her seat.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded yes as she made a right on that last street before the hospital. "Pulmonary arrest." She replied. "She's in critical condition."</p>
		<p>"Who found her?" Gretchen asked quietly.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh searched the rearview mirror for Robie, who seemed at a loss of words and close to tears. She sighed. "I don't know." She said. She pulled into the emergency room parking lot, and stopped the car, glancing at George. "Park it, will you?" She said, and didn't wait for an answer, jumping out and running towards the entrance. She caught sight of Andrea as she ran up towards the entrance to the restricted area of the emergency area.</p>
		<p>Andrea saw her with tearful, red-rimmed eyes, and stood up from the chair she was huddling on. She stared after her as Ashleigh acknowledged her with a perfunctory nod. She strode in through the heavy double doors to the emergency room. The head doctor of the emergency room, a stocky gray haired man in his forties, greeted her, already knowing that she was coming in. He pulled her towards the area Cassidy was in as she donned the scrubs. "How's she holding up, Marco?" She demanded.</p>
		<p>"Stable now, Ashleigh, but very critical." He replied; his voice was expressionless. "I know she's a personal friend of yours, and that you're her doctor as well, but you need to be practical. Okay?" Ashleigh nodded. "Because you see, we did some blood work, and this woman consumed enough cocaine for about three people. It must have been in the process of about one hour or less. Whoever provided her with this poison, must have wanted her dead or been in a high of his or her own, to let her consume so much."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded as he guided her to the compartment in which they'd accommodated Cassidy. Ashleigh sighed at the sight of her friend, who looked worse now than when she'd been there the last time. She had respiratory help, a thick tube taped to her cheek and going in through her mouth; it guided the oxygen into her lungs from its connection to a machine, making her weakened lungs inhale and exhale. An IV line ran from her right arm, connected to a bag of feed for her system; another was connected to her other wrist, a solution to clean the filth in her blood. Ashleigh stepped up close to the stretcher, and looked her friend and patient over.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was so thin, so pale and bluish. Ashleigh knew that she'd had a close call, and that she was still close. Cassidy's chest rose and fell shallowly, letting her know that her lungs were weak, and that they weren't responding on their own, that the machine was necessary. "Any brain damage?" She asked evenly.</p>
		<p>Doctor Marco Estevez sighed. "None that we can see yet." He said softly. "But we can't say, at least until she wakes. She hadn't been breathing for about two minutes by the time the paramedics arrived; it took them another couple of minutes to bring her lungs around to at least draw in <i>some</i> oxygen. They assisted her all the way here."</p>
		<p>"Who called in for the ambulance?" Ashleigh asked, touching Cassidy's forehead softly. It was cold and clammy.</p>
		<p>"A young woman sitting outside. I thought you'd know her, since she was the one who gave us all the information about you being her doctor." Marco Estevez replied calmly.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded, staring at Cassidy's beautiful still face. "Well," She said slowly, trying to control her voice. "I guess there's nothing for me to do right now." She looked at him with a grateful expression. "I'd like to see tonight's chart, and I'll take over her care from here." She extended her hand for a shake and he shook it. "Thanks, Marco, I really appreciate your help."</p>
		<p>He smiled at her reassuringly. "She'll come out of this one, Ashleigh. Don't worry." He said.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded, and went to the nurse's desk, where she was handed new green scrubs and her stethoscope from her locker. "Thank you," She said briskly.</p>
		<p>After changing, she returned to the waiting room, where she found Gretchen, George, and Robie flanking Andrea's side. Andrea was shaking her head, tears ran down her cheeks, her eyes were closed tightly. Robie caught sight of Ashleigh from the corner of her eye, and half turned to face her, demanding with her eyes. Ashleigh's somber expression scared her, and she shook her head, whispering: "No."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled reassuringly. "No," She said firmly. "She's alive, don't worry. And I'm doing my best to keep it that way." She reached out and squeezed Robie's shoulder gently. She continued to Andrea's side, sitting beside her when George moved from the seat. Andrea looked at her with pleading eyes. Ashleigh wrapped her arm around her shoulder, pulling her close. "It seems you keep finding yourself in situations with Cassidy that require a hospital." She whispered gently, smiling sympathetically.</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded slowly, sobbing softly. "Ashleigh, she's killing me!" She rocked herself slowly, her arms wrapped around herself. George kneeled in front of her, taking her hands and squeezing softly. Andrea gasped as more tears ran down her cheeks. "Why is she doing this to herself? Why?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh tried to hold back tears of frustration. "I don't know." She said softly, holding Andrea tightly. "I really can't explain Cassidy, Andrea. But I promise this; she will go to psychiatrist once she comes out of here. I'm not letting her out of this hospital unless she complies, and that will be that."</p>
		<p>George stood up abruptly, her movements suddenly harsh and angry. "Ashleigh," She said softly. "May I speak with you?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh stood up, letting Robie take her place, and walked a few feet away with George. Gretchen followed, and George took her hand. George said: "The question we have to ask is who gave her this poison."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh could see her strain for control by the way her jaw clenched and unclenched tightly. She nodded, and glanced at Gretchen. Gretchen was nodding her agreement, one arm twining around her lover's. Ashleigh sighed. "I have an idea as to who might have provided her with the drug." She said softly.</p>
		<p>George's eyes hardened. "Who?" She demanded, clenching her fist.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh looked down. "She has a friend, named Josua, he? ah," She hesitated. "He's a heavy coke addict, <i>really</i> into it. She's been trying to get him to stop for years. And you know she hasn't been exactly herself lately, she might not have refused if offered enough." She was pensive, and slipped her hands deep into the pockets of her pant scrubs.</p>
		<p>George made eye contact with Gretchen, then looked back at Ashleigh. "Where does he live?" She demanded of her.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh took a deep breath. "He lives on Monroe Street, a couple of blocks down from Cassidy's apartment. His building is Hastings Courts." She said, not wanting to know what George's intention was.</p>
		<p>George nodded. "What apartment?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Ashleigh shrugged. "His name is Josua Maldonado."</p>
		<p>George's lips pursed. "Perfect." She said. She reached into her jacket pocket for her pen, taking a paper from Ashleigh's pad. She wrote down a number. "This is my beeper number, Ashleigh. Beep me if anything. I'm taking your car." She handed her the paper, and walked to the exit, Gretchen with her.</p>
