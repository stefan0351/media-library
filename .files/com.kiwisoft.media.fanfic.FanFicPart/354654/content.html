<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 27 -->

<p>"What the hell do you mean they are Trinity?" Giles demanded to know.
David looked at Buffy, Willow, and Xander who were curled up on the couch
together fast asleep. The ritual had taken a lot out of everyone and no
sooner had the three sat down they fell asleep.</p>

<p>"There is a legend that one day there will be three people with one
soul known as Trinity. Together they will be a powerful force and lead the
forces of good. In the ritual, their souls became one. They are Trinity. God!
It explains so much!" David exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Explains what?" asked Xander who had woken up. Buffy and Willow were
still asleep.</p>

<p>"Like how you three are so tangled up emotionally. Like how come Buffy
has faced the apocalypse so often." David told Xander.</p>

<p>"What has them being Trinity have to do with the apocalypse?" Giles
asked his son.</p>

<p>"Look. For eons, the fight between demons and humans has generally
favoured demons. With the exception of the Slayer and a handful of others,
humans have been incapable of fighting demons on anything like equal terms.
Now with the advance in technology, demons run the risk of being wiped out.
Human weapons are becoming more and more lethal to demons, and demons by
their nature cannot adapt to these new weapons. It won't be too long before
only the most powerful magical demons will be able to attack humans without
fear of being vaporised." said David.</p>

<p>"Like phasers on Star Trek?"  enquired Xander.</p>

<p>"Yes. With one of those babies, one person could wipe out legions of
demons and vampires. Shit, demons and vampires are already in trouble because
of Match Head bullets.</p>

<p>"So you combine advancing technology and the arrival of Trinity, it
means that demons must win now or humans will eventually win. Quickest way of
winning for demons is to bring about the apocalypse. That's why you guys have
faced it so often. For demons it's now or never." David explained. There was
a minute or two of silence as they thought it through.</p>

<p>"OK then, what do we know about this Trinity?" Giles asked. David
shrugged and went to the library. He returned with a pile of books.</p>

<p>"You guys start looking in the Althos Works, I'll start with the
Chronicles of Golgotha." he said as the three of them started researching.
Twenty minutes later, David spoke.</p>

<p>"Proeliator consisto lumen, custos cretatus, veneficus consisto
flamma, voluntas fieri modus. Tunc vinculum mos consisto scelratus." David
read from the Chronicles of Golgotha. He had not had a chance to read it
since stealing it from the Vatican Black Library, something that he truly
regretted now.</p>

<p>"Well? In English?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Warrior of light, guardian in white, witch of flame, will be bond.
And then the bond will be formed with blood." David roughly translated.</p>

<p>"Still not getting it." Xander said. Giles took his glasses off and
began cleaning them as he explained.</p>

<p>"The warrior of light would refer to Buffy. Witch of flame is probably
Willow, which means that you are the guardian in white. You three will be
bond. Obviously it means the ritual. But I'm not sure what it means where it
talks about the bond will be formed with blood."</p>

<p>In that moment, David knew what it meant. The last piece had fallen
into place. David was as scared as he had ever been in his whole life. He
stood and walked out.</p>

<p>"David? Where are you going?" Giles asked. David stopped and turned.
The fear and sadness on his face evident.</p>

<p>"I just need to get some sleep. I'll see you both in the morning."
David said quietly and left.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The next morning saw David and Xander, down in the armoury checking
weapons for the war.</p>

<p>"Xander? What's it like? You know, to be Trinity?" David asked. Xander
stopped what he was doing and thought for a few moments.</p>

<p>"It's hard to describe. There is all these strange feelings running
through me. It's like a heightened sense of awareness of Buffy and Willow. I
feel what they feel, and they feel what I feel. It's a connection deeper and
stronger than anything you could think of. Each of us has this connection
which goes beyond love or caring or any emotion. We are one with each other.
It's as if we had been living in a two dimensional world and now there is
this third dimension that we have suddenly become aware of." explained
Xander. David merely nodded and took it in. They resumed cleaning and
checking the weapons when Xander asked David a question that had bugged him
all morning.</p>

<p>"So, what about your soulmate?" David stopped briefly.</p>

<p>"Not coming." he said and resumed work.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'not coming'? How could they be not coming?" Xander
insisted. David threw down the gun in anger.</p>

<p>"I mean that they can't come to me and I can't go to her! So just
leave it!" David yelled at Xander then stomped off. Xander watched his friend
go and wondered what it all meant.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Later that day, Xander discussed what had happened in the armoury with
Giles, Buffy and Willow.</p>

<p>"His soulmate can't be dead, otherwise David would have died last
night." Buffy pointed out.</p>

<p>"With all the resources of several governments behind him, you would
think that getting someone here would be easy." said Giles.</p>

<p>"I'm more worried about this sixth person we need for the War Of The
Six. David said he has it under control, but I'm not comfortable with that."
Willow said. Xander exhaled.</p>

<p>"Will, we just have to trust him in this." he said.</p>
