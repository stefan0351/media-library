<!-- Did I Ever Tell You About My Chat With Ann Margaret? -->


<p>After dinner they sat down in the living room with a few movies and
snack foods.</p>

<p>"What are we watching tonight, Brooke?" Sam asked as she settled into
a more comfortable position on the couch.  Brooke popped the DVD in
the player and started to head to the armchair when she saw the
disappointed look on Sam's face.  Changing her mind, she sat at Sam's
feet and pulled them into her lap and massaged the uncasted foot.</p>

<p>"Feels nice," Sam purred.  "Movie?" Brooke smiled.</p>

<p>"I thought we'd start with the ultimate edition unrated American Pie
and then go with Save the Last Dance." </p>

<p>"Sounds good," Sam responded as she surrendered to Brooke's
ministrations.  Even if she could never have Brooke as anything more
than a good friend and stepsister, she was going to enjoy every close
moment she got to share with her.</p>

<p>Brooke was watching the contented expressions pass over Sam's face.
She knew how Sam's foot sometimes hurt from supporting her entire
weight in therapy sessions and was more than happy to alleviate some
of that tension and discomfort.  Even if she could never have Sam as
anything more than a good friend and stepsister, she was going to
enjoy every close moment she got to share with her.</p>

<p>"Hey Sam?" Brooke called down the couch as they watched the kid from
American Pie hump the apple pie and giggled.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Sam answered, lifting her head.</p>

<p>"Did I tell you I saw God?" Sam lifted a brow.</p>

<p>"In a slice of apple pie?" Brooke pinched Sam's toes. "Ow!"</p>

<p>"No, you nutball, while you were in a coma." Sam sat up further while
still keeping her legs in Brooke's lap.</p>

<p>"Nope, I missed that story.  Did he have anything deep and meaningful
to say?" </p>

<p>"She told me to keep talking to you, believe in you," Brooke started.</p>

<p>"God's a she, huh?  I knew it," Sam laughed.  "Probably got a wicked
sense of humor too." Brooke smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah.  Do you think I'm crazy?" Sam gave her a wry smile.</p>

<p>"Not anymore than usual, no." Brooke swatted her on the foot.  "Look,
you say you saw and spoke to God, I believe you.  Hell, I swear I saw
my Dad and spoke to you while I was in a coma.  And we both know that
was impossible."  Brooke sat up further on the couch leaning towards
Sam, a serious look on her face.</p>

<p>"Why is that impossible, Sammy?"</p>

<p>"I saw those photos of me, Brooke, I was more dead than alive.  Dad
is dead, and you are alive.  I couldn't have talked to the two of you
at the same time," Sam explained logically.</p>

<p>"Sam, I spoke to your Dad," Sam glared at her incredulously.  "I'm
not picking a fight, hear me out.  I fell asleep at your bedside and
woke up and God was there.  I talked to her but she couldn't tell me
whether or not you were going to make it.  But she did let me talk to
you.  That's when I met Joe.  He brought me to you."</p>

<p>"You're making this up," Sam snapped.  Brooke sighed.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not.  I can tell you how soft and gentle his voice was, how
it had a slight lilt to it when he spoke," she watched Sam's eyes get
wide and slightly watery.  "You were in a field near a stream,
dangling your feet in and watching scenes from your life pass by,"
she continued.</p>

<p>"Missed out in a career in hockey or roller derby," Sam whispered in
disbelief.  She looked up into Brooke's eyes.  "I thought I imagined
it.  How is it possible?  What does it mean?" Brooke moved so that
she was hugging the now crying girl and shrugged.</p>

<p>"I dunno, really.  But it was real, Sammy.  I was really there."</p>

<p>"Well, that just complicates matters, doesn't it?" Sam sniffed.
Brooke frowned.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I was all ready to pawn you off as certifiably insane, and now it
looks like we both are," Sam joked.  Brooke shook her head and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Ain't it the truth?" she let Sam lean her head on her shoulder to
watch the rest of the movie and was surprised to find her asleep by
the end.  Brooke watched the other girl sleep peacefully for a long
time before drifting off herself.</p>

<p>&lt;Night, Sammy.  Whether or not God was right about there ever being
anything more between us, I'll never trade your friendship and trust
for anything in the world&gt;</p>
