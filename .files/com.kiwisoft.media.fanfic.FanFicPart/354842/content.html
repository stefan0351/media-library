<!-- World Without Love \ Part 7 -->

<p>Janeway looked surprised up from her work, not having heard the door chime, which it hadn't, Seven had just come in without asking and had pulled B'Elanna with her. The Captain just decided to overlook the breach of protocol, she had to do enough as it was. "Whatever brings you here, Seven, B'Elanna?" She nodded to greet them.</p>

		<p>"Captain, we have made an important discovery," Seven began.</p>

		<p>"You have Seven, I had nothing to do with it," B'Elanna interrupted not wanting to claim credit for something she hadn't done.</p>

		<p>"We found a wormhole," Seven explained insisting to give B'Elanna the acknowledgement she had earned. After all Seven herself hadn't been able to increase sensor efficiency as much as B'Elanna had done and she had certainly tried.</p>

		<p>Janeway was speechless, a wormhole? That could be the way home they had searched for, but having to many times before been disappointed by what looked like a chance to get home, she decided to be cautious. "What do we know about it?"</p>

		<p>"That it is there," Seven said and added: "I advise further investigations."</p>

		<p>Janeway was disappointed about the lack of information, but decided that this problem was one to be easily solved. "Make the sensor phalanxes your top priority and after they are repaired make a full scan of the wormhole, we need all information we can get about it. B'Elanna you work together with Seven on this project, let Vorik take over in engineering."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," the two replied in unison.</p>

		<p>Being dismissed they left the ready room and went to Astrometrics. Where they once again worked together and after one and a half hour they had succeeded in repairing the exponentially damaged sensory systems. "Finally," B'Elanna sighed relieved and shut the access hatch.</p>

		<p>Seven was standing at a console accessing the sensor readings that were now freely flowing. "I am getting readings from the wormhole in the nebula . . . it seems stable, but I can say nothing else with the readings I get here."</p>

		<p>"How about we send a spatial probe into the nebula to see where the wormhole leads?"</p>

		<p>"We would first have to determine a way to lessen the impact the nebula has onto our systems, the nebula could harm such a probe, too."</p>

		<p>"No Seven, not when we use a small enough probe, and we just need a class four probe, which is small enough not to attract these darned particles, but can still send us all telemetry we need. It is even possible to send it through the wormhole, we'd just have to strengthen the shields for the rough trip through the wormhole."</p>

		<p>"But-"</p>

		<p>"No buts, Seven, it is just perfect."</p>

		<p>"-we have no class four probe."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna run quickly over all available probes in her mind and found that Seven was right, they had used the last one to investigate the event horizon of a black hole. It never returned. The engineer went quickly over all possibilities that were left and found just one option. "Well then we will have to build a new one."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The next few days went by quickly. Seven and B'Elanna built a new probe and while working together so closely they managed to form a friendship, they were seen together even on off duty hours and not only talking about their project. They bonded in these days, and discussed the amazing similarities between them, for example being torn between two heritages or their fondness of 20th century music. The latter really surprised B'Elanna, true she had heard Seven sing songs of that era, but had expected that the beautiful ex-drone had some logical reason for that. That Seven simply liked singing had not occurred to her, not even when she had heard the emotions the ex-Borg put into her singing. B'Elanna also talked with Seven when Tom surprisingly broke up with her and how she hadn't expected him to do so, before she had the chance to do it, she also told the ex-Borg how relieved she was now that this matter was resolved. And Seven spoke with B'Elanna about how she tried to fit in but didn't seem to succeed. But there was one thing they didn't talk about: the growing emotions that both were developing for the other, both insecure about what to do about them and how it would effect the other .</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Janeway had in an effort not to get hopes up only told her senior staff about the wormhole, which now seemed to have been a wise decision, for it only lead to a point in the Gamma Quadrant that was even farther away from the Alpha Quadrant than the part of Delta Quadrant they were in now. Even with the Bajoran stable wormhole it would take them longer than if they just continued their journey home from here. Just another chance that didn't work out, just another chance for Janeway to indulge in self-reproach about it being her fault that Voyager was so far away from home.</p>

		<p>She however didn't get the chance to live the latter out to its full extend, as Seven caught up on her mood, the ex-drone saw more than she normally let on, and told her to "stop self pitying and be a good Captain again, the Captain who made the Voyager a home away from home for many of the crew."</p>

		<p>Janeway had been really caught off guard by this one. She wanted to ask Seven about it, but the beautiful blonde had already left the ready room when Janeway had overcome her speechlessness. 'Well at least this nebula was good for morale,' the tired Captain thought, contemplating the new friendship of B'Elanna Torres and Seven of Nine, which had increased working efficiency down in Engineering, because if the Lieutenant was in a good mood her staff was in a good mood, too. And an Engineering crew in good spirits made for Voyager being repaired much earlier, and even some systems working better than before.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Are you disappointed that the wormhole didn't lead to the Alpha Quadrant?" The question from Seven came out of nowhere, both sitting at a table in mess hall, with Seven reading a padd and B'Elanna eating a meal. It was a habit they had developed in the last few days, B'Elanna would eat in silence and in the meantime Seven would read some text, and after B'Elanna being finished they would talk, about work or something other that came to their minds.</p>

		<p>Laying down her fork and knife and pushing away her dish, she answered the question. "Yes, ...... no, not really I guess," B'Elanna made a slight pause and then continued, "well, you see Seven I have more here on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant than I ever had at home. Here I am chief engineer of a Starfleet vessel, there I would probably put into prison by Starfleet. Here I have friends and ." she wanted to say "you", but stopped herself before she could do so.</p>

		<p>"And?" Seven asked, her curiosity piqued.</p>

		<p>"Nothing, okay?"</p>

		<p>Seven nodded, although she was still curious. "You are right B'Elanna from your point of view a life on Voyager is more desirable than a life in Alpha Quadrant, but what about your family?" Seven asked, as she knew family was one of the main reasons the Voyager crew wanted to get home so badly and she had researched the topic in the last few days, when she had time to do so and it seemed like something called "family ties" were quite strong.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna let out a laugh, but it didn't sound like a happy one to Seven, who had heard the half Klingon laugh quite often when they had worked together to built the probe.</p>

		<p>"Family? My mother thinks I am not a proper Klingon, we haven't talked with each other in the last 10 years and my father left us when I was only five. I have no family." The last sentence was said with a sad tone in B'Elanna's voice.</p>

		<p>"She is wrong," Seven stated.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was confused. "What do you mean?"</p>

		<p>"She is wrong about you not being a proper Klingon. You are. You have honour, are a warrior and make an unconscious effort not to violate any Klingon rules."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was speechless. "I do?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. In fact the only un-Klingon behaviour I have seen you do was your bonding with Tom Paris."</p>
