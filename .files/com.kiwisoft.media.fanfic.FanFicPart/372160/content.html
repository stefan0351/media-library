<P>a/n: well thanks for the reviews, you guys that did. :) I'm glad y'all are liking it. I'm enjoying writing it…annnd I'm pretty glad about how it's turned out so far. Thanks for the reviews and reading :)</P><P>Chapter Six: Don't Walk Away</P><P>"We were…" Lilly started saying, "Umm, about to go back to the bed and break fast…" She pulled away from me gently, going over to her clothes by the horses. "'Cause I don't know about you, but I'm starving."</P><P>I scowled, "Oh okay," I headed grudgingly over to my clothes and started to pull them on. "What do you want to eat for lunch?"</P><P>"Um, what's good?"</P><P>I glanced up at her and winked, "Me."</P><P>Lilly rolled her eyes at me as she struggled to get her pants on without falling over. "I'm sure."</P><P>I just grinned at her cockily.</P><P>Once we were on the trail again Lilly struck up a conversation, "I just want to take it slow."</P><P>"Oh, uh, alright." I said uncertainly, not sure what she was talking about, so I slowed Bluejeans down. "Sorry, I didn't know we were going to fast for you, you didn't mind on the way here."</P><P>"Huh?"</P><P>"Uhh, you meant the horses, right?"</P><P>"Um, no Miley, I meant what happened in the river…" She mumbled, and I knew she was probably blushing.</P><P>"Ohh, that. I'm sorry Lilly, I thought you were comfortable with that." I said, turning to glance behind me at her.</P><P>"It's fine…just, I just…don't want to rush it. We've got a month to know each other, let's just go a little slower."</P><P>"I'm sorry Lilly, we can take it slow." I said quietly, I hadn't meant to make her feel uncomfortable.</P><P>"It's fine…but could you um, make the horses go a little faster? I'm really hungry." She laughed softly.</P><P>"Okay, hold on." I kicked Bluejeans into a trot, then to a canter, slowly gain speed until we were galloping through the hills, I heard Lilly go, "Eep!" and I laughed, "Just hang on with your knees and hang tight to the reins but don't pull on them or she'll stop and throw you off."</P><P>"God, you make me feel so safe," She yelped sarcastically.</P><P>"Wait here," I told Lilly when we got to the stables and I had handed Bluejeans and 'Girl off to Travis so he could wash them down and settle them in for the night. "Let me just grab some stuff from the kitchen."</P><P>"Okay," She looked around, and then took a seat on the bench beside the stables.</P><P>"I'll be right back," I said then started jogging as fast as I could without slipping in my boots. I pushed open the back door to the bed and breakfast. "Hey mama, do we have any like sandwiches or something I can take?"</P><P>"We've got a couple in the fridge I think, why darlin'?" She asked.</P><P>"Me 'nd Lilly are hungry." I grabbed the two sandwiches from the fridge along with some apples, putting them all in a little brown paper bag. Taking some cokes from the fridge too I put them in a separate baggie.</P><P>"Okay, but don't forget you need to be back here later to muck out the horse stalls with Travis and clean the kitchen after dinner." She reminded me.</P><P>"Okaay," I whined.</P><P>"Have fun with your friend, I'm glad she found you to spend time with."</P><P>"Why?" I asked curiously.</P><P>"Her mama just left her here for the month, told me to look after her. I was worried you two wouldn't get along or she would just be stuck in her room the whole time." She shook her head, "It's a shame Lilly sounds like a nice girl."</P><P>"Well, we're getting along alright mama," Better than you'd think, I smiled.</P><P>"Now Miley Rae, I know that look…don't you go pulling anything with that girl. You know how people around here feel about things like that. You know what happened last summer...don't let that happen again." Mama scolded me, "Now get out of here or I'm going to make you serve lunch and not Jackson."</P><P>"Okay mama, I'll be back in time for dinner." I pushed open the back door and went back to the stables. Finding Lilly in front of Cinnamon's stall, I grinned, "You like that little filly huh?"</P><P>Lilly smiled when she looked over her shoulder at me, "Yeah, she's so cute. I love her brown spots."</P><P>"They call horses like that paint horses." I said.</P><P>"I wish I could have a little horse…they're really sweet I'm realizing."</P><P>"Aw, well…maybe one day." I said, "But c'mon, I've got lunch." I walked over to my four wheeler, patting the back of the seat, "Hop on behind me."</P><P>She looked skeptical, "Where are we going now Miley?"</P><P>"Just to the fields."</P><P>"The fields?"</P><P>"Where you found me yesterday," I grabbed her hand and pulled her over to the four wheeler, "Get on."</P><P>She hopped on behind me.</P><P>"Now hang on tight." I grinned, as she wrapped her arms around my waist.</P><P>We got off the four wheeler under a tree on top of the hill where Lilly and I first met yesterday. I stretched, pulling the sandwiches out of the bag I handed one to Lilly and sat down under the tree with mine. "Come sit with me." I said to her.</P><P>She sat down, looking over at our cattle that were grazing nearby, some looking at us curiously. "Will they bother us?"</P><P>"The cows?" I looked over at them, "Nah, they just want to eat their grass."</P><P>"Oh okay." She ate her sandwich quietly and quickly, keeping a nervous eye on them the whole time. "What kind are they?" She asked when she was done eating.</P><P>"Shorthorns." I said, finishing up my sandwich I leaned against the tree closing my eyes with a sigh.</P><P>"What're they for?"</P><P>"Well…meat or dairy, they can be either. But we show them too, or sell they're calves to be show cattle really. We've got so many, 'nd so much stuff going on we don't really have a chance to show them…sometimes Travis and Jackson, if they see any they like they'll take them out to a couple shows just to get our name around." I replied.</P><P>"Do you show them ever?"</P><P>"Hmm…I have, a few times. I'd rather jus' mess around the house though with the horses or at the bed and breakfast though."</P><P>"Oh." She said quietly.</P><P>"There are some cokes in the other bag if you're thirsty," I told her.</P><P>"I'm okay." She said, and I heard her inch towards me.</P><P>I opened one eye watching her, "What're you doing?"</P><P>She looked at me shyly, "Can I rest my head on you? I'm a little tired…just from the ride and stuff."</P><P>I smiled, "Sure."</P><P>She inched over a little bit more, lying down she rested her head in my lap, "Thanks."</P><P>I ran my fingers through her hair, "Anytime, Lilly."</P>
