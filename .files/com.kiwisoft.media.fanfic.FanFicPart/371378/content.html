<p><i>A/N: And so this is Christmas... It's taken me just under a year but I always knew I would be able to complete this story. I managed to find moments of time to write it in the randomest pockets of the year, including summer! But I wanted to keep the chapters relevant to their dates. I wish all of my readers a very Merry Christmas. I'll save the New Year part until later ;) The final chapter should be up tomorrow - depends how busy my day is.<br>

<p><i>By the way, this story, including the prior chapters, is officially an unofficial tribute to my fan dcjp who has made the last couple of my writing months extra special... Happy Christmas penpal.<br>

<p><b>Chapter 5</b></p>
<p><i>24</i><i>th</i><i> December</i></p>
<p>Lilly could see the tears lining Miley's clear blue eyes and knew that she could not stand to be witness to the other girl's not-so-secret misery any longer. She watched Miley for only a couple of seconds longer, noting the great droplets threaten to spill from her eyes, from where they clung like raindrops on a window pane, to the glassy surface of her oceanic irises.</p>
<p>"I don't think I can go any further." Lilly sighed as she glanced down the slope before them, filled with cruel bumps called moguls that were formed on the mountains to give skiers more of a challenge.</p>
<p>Miley looked up and Lilly could almost count every tear that now held on precariously to her long eyelashes, behind her tinted ski goggles. "You don't want to go on?" Miley whispered, before nervously turning her head to see the rest of the group psyching themselves up to follow the younger boys who were already shrieking down the course.</p>
<p>"No way." Lilly shook her head and smiled encouragingly to Miley, "Do you wanna head back?"</p>
<p>"Only if you're sure." Miley replied, but she didn't look very uncertain about what she wanted to do.</p>
<p>"I'm positive." Lilly called over to their instructor, "Jean-Michelle? Miley and I are going to go back now. I don't want to do the next part of the slope."</p>
<p>Jean-Michelle slid over to join them, "Are you sure Lilly? It iz really okay if you take it slow."</p>
<p>"I'm good thanks; I've had my share of skiing for one day." Lilly answered jovially, "This course has been fun but I'm ready to pack it in and head back with Miley here."</p>
<p>Miley smiled appreciatively and Jean-Michelle shrugged, "If you say so. Ze best way to get back iz to go left down zat slope and zen join ze big ski lift up to ze top. You zen have to go against the flow of everyone else across the flat and zen climb one of ze hills, which will be a leettle difficult but I'm sure you will manage."</p>
<p>"Thank you." Lilly muttered and beamed at Miley, "Come on then Stewart, I've just got us out of possibly breaking our necks."</p>
<p>Miley managed a very small smile and, once their instructor had moved off, sniffed, "You have no idea how much this means to me Lilly." Miley confided in the other girl.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Lilly was already setting off in the direction Jean- Michelle had shown them, but waiting for Miley to keep up.</p>
<p>"You sacrificed the last leg of the slopes to keep me, the biggest wimp in the history of the world, happy."</p>
<p>"Miley…"</p>
<p>"No, no, don't you go <i>Miley</i>-ing me," Miley disagreed gently, "I'm the one who can't finish the run because I'm a coward."</p>
<p>"You're not a coward." Lilly had stopped to turn and face Miley properly, "This ski-run has been so difficult, starting with that damn hill, practically vertical, that you wiped-out on so many times, but you kept going… Then we had that hidden jump no one warned you about and you went flying… Then there was that kid who took you down, followed by the patch of snow machines which were exhausting to get through. Considering that you're not great at this whole skiing thing, you sure have done better than anyone else today. All those other people gave up even before they saw the slope and went for coffees instead, but you Miley, you stuck with this and it's okay to give up here. I don't want to do this! I've had enough falls today and enough bruises to last me a year so please, don't argue with me and let's get back before we get any older. I'll even treat you to a hot drink, if you like."</p>
<p>A proper smile finally flooded Miley's features and she grinned shyly back at Lilly, "Thank you."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, "You're welcome. Now, follow me and <i>try</i> not to get yourself into too much trouble." Lilly teased.</p>
<p>Miley willingly complied and carefully followed the blonde. Lilly was filled with a growing sense of pride in her newly developed skiing skills, but couldn't shake the mild nerves which trilled within her at the thought of Miley watching her pave their way. The idea of the deep blue eyes skating over her form from behind was enough to make Lilly's cheeks burn hot, and she was grateful that Miley would never be bold enough to take the lead and notice this.</p>
<p>The ski-lift itself was set over a long distance, rising higher and higher into the mountains to cover almost the entire spread of the course which the girls had completed that day. The benches were wide enough to fit three people, rather than the smaller couple seats, and there was already a lot of chatter amongst the crowd assembled at the bottom of the lift.</p>
<p>"Do you think we'll have to share our lift with other people to minimise the queue size?" Miley asked and Lilly quirked an eyebrow behind her ski goggles.</p>
<p>"Who are you, some kind of crowd-control geek?"</p>
<p>Miley laughed, "I dunno. Just sometimes I get concerned about rules and regulations."</p>
<p>"What a dork!" Lilly laughed brightly and Miley smacked her playfully in the arm, yet Lilly could read the glint in her eyes. Miley was secretly glad of the blonde's mild mocking, since it lifted the weight of her ski anxiety from her.</p>
<p>The pair readied themselves for their lift journey, settling their ski goggles on top of their hats and giggling at each other occasionally, for no apparent reason. Lilly's insides were once again gurgling with her brewing feelings and it took a lot of her self restraint to prevent herself from finding the smallest reasons to touch Miley.</p>
<p>"We're up next." Miley suddenly announced and Lilly forced herself to concentrate on boarding their lift seat, which fortunately went without a hitch and soon the bench gently swung them higher into the French mountains.</p>
<p>"It's so nice to be sitting down." Miley declared from very close beside Lilly and she happily linked her arm through the blonde's.</p>
<p>Lilly gulped and cast her eyes quickly over the expanse of space on the other side of Miley. Lilly had chosen to hug the armrest of their seat to give the girls as much room as possible to relax, yet Miley stuck to her side and was now keeping them tied together through some motive unknown to Lilly.</p>
<p>The blonde quickly shook off her worried feelings and enjoyed the comfortable sensation of Miley Stewart's warm body aligned with her own. At least their journey through the mountains promised to be cosy, and Lilly knew that she couldn't grow cold with the object of her desires nearly satisfying the heated yearning that ran through her whole being.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it is good to be resting our legs." Lilly finally agreed from beside her friend and squeezed Miley's arm contentedly.</p>
<p>"The view is so gorgeous."</p>
<p>Lilly looked down and watched the pine trees flow beneath them as their lift rose higher. She could make out the black dots of figures choosing to ski more dangerously off-piste, making the trees their natural slalom course, as they raced their way precariously down the mountainside. Lilly then glanced over to her right and felt wonderment trickle steadily through her as she stole coveted glances at Miley's shining eyes, since the brunette was caught up in the snowy beauty that surrounded them.</p>
<p>"The view's great." Lilly murmured and grinned secretly as she feigned interest in the slopes further away.</p>
<p>"It kinda makes that awful blue-run worth while, being up here with you, when I know that the worst of the day is over and there are only good things to look forward to." Miley admitted.</p>
<p>Lilly chuckled, "Well I'm glad that I can share this happy feeling with you then. At the moment there's nowhere else I'd really rather be."</p>
<p>Miley smiled brightly, "That's so sweet of you to say Lilly."</p>
<p>"Hey, you said it first." Lilly replied and shared Miley's smile.</p>
<p>Miley merely shook her head and laughed lightly, before her dancing eyes connected with Lilly's and then she placed her head, covered in those turbulent curls, directly onto Lilly's shoulder.</p>
<p>Lilly's smile grew suddenly until she didn't think it would ever end and she had to fight the will to scream a cry of victory. The triumph itself remained inside her, giving its signs only through the pink glow in her cheeks, that extra twinkle in her eye and the rapid pulsing of her heart, which she was certain that Miley could hear, yet the other girl never showed any notice.</p>
<p>The pair sat for a while, swinging loftily above the frozen ground, with the thrill of the cold air on their cheeks and the distant sound of other voices around them. Miley eventually eased herself from Lilly's shoulder and turned to give Lilly her full attention once again, "What are you doing this evening?"</p>
<p>Lilly pouted as she concentrated on the plans her parents had made, "Well my parents were just gonna have Christmas Eve with us in their room, chatting and family stuff… But, Matt is keener on hitting the bar with Sarah, which does sound like the better plan."</p>
<p>"That's where I'll be," Miley chirped, "with my dad and brother of course, I'm not some lone alcoholic."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed, "Of course not Miley."</p>
<p>"Is that sarcasm I detect there in your voice?" Lilly shrugged and Miley bumped her gently, "You know Lilly, you'd be welcome to join us."</p>
<p>Lilly tried to suppress her smile, yet was coming to terms with the fact that she would never be able to around this particular girl and, with the hint of a smirk, replied, "I'd love to."</p>
<p>"Great." Miley sighed and resumed her comfortable position with her head once more on Lilly's shoulder.</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>Shelves upon shelves full of beautiful crafts, miniature statues and novelty items filled up the room and Lilly looked wildly around, searching for inspiration. She didn't have much time left to buy the present she was hoping to find; the perfect gift for a nearly perfect person, who was beginning to consume every second thought she had that holiday.</p>
<p>Somehow the wooden toys; the soldiers, the ballerinas, the trains, the figures on skis, just weren't mature enough, and yet the paintings, wine bottle holders and silverware were too sophisticated. There didn't seem to be a happy medium and Lilly paced her way steadily through the aisles between gift stands, growing steadily more desperate. It was just as she was turning towards the exit that something on the back wall caught her eye. The idea was simple, but a classic. It was completely Christmas related as well as having those hidden romantic notions that Lilly wanted to spell out for Miley Stewart, but in such a way that the other girl would never be able to determine her true intentions. Without a second thought, Lilly Truscott took the object in her hand and marched up to the till with pride.</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>The music was pounding from two large speakers attached to a wall, just beside a small stage that jutted out into the lounge area of the bar. Varying groups of people added to the heaving atmosphere, where adults sipped in a leisurely fashion from tall drinks and children continued to forge their ever growing friendships as they darted between the gaps in the crowd. One man had his place on the stage and Lilly could just discern the words "…I wish it could be Christmas everyday…" before her mind swallowed all drifting thought processes when her eyes landed on the other girl.</p>
<p>Miley was standing comfortably among her small family group. Her father was drinking some beer, with Jackson mimicking his choice, and Miley had a glass of wine. Lilly stopped to watch her for a few precious moments that she knew she could get away with before Miley would see her. Miley was laughing at a joke that her brother had made, and the effect was that her eyes sparkled brighter and dazzled Lilly from across the crowded room. Her pouting lips curled up at the corners to reveal her warm smile and, as she shook her head in denial from the statement her brother had made about her, soft brown curls tumbled gracefully about her shoulders since her hair had been let loose to do as it pleased that night.</p>
<p>The brunette seemed somewhat distracted, however, and her eyes flickered over her shoulder, or in the general direction of the bar, and Miley Stewart never seemed satisfied in what she found as she glanced about. Finally she relaxed as her eyes rested on Lilly, "Hey." Miley mouthed across the space between them and Lilly raised her hand, her fingers twitched, and she waved a small greeting back. Miley was soon beckoning her over and Lilly willed her legs to bear her safely to the brunette, for she didn't quite trust them when Miley was around.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you could make it." Miley murmured affectionately and she wrapped her arms around Lilly's shoulders, drawing her towards her briefly.</p>
<p>Lilly allowed herself a moment snuggled against Miley's torso before pulling away to stand beside her, "I wouldn't miss a Christmas Eve of socialising in the bar over sitting in my parents room and making conversation whilst Matt and Sarah lived it up down here." Lilly gestured over to the bar to where her brother and future sister-in-law were paired up and talking closely.</p>
<p>"Well I'm honoured to have your company."</p>
<p>Lilly blinked, and took the glass of wine which Miley held out for her, "Gosh, you're always thinking aren't you?" Lilly said gratefully and sipped her drink whilst Miley just smiled at her, "So… What exactly is going on tonight?"</p>
<p>"It's an open-mic night." Miley explained and turned Lilly toward the stage, "That guy's just been up and now it's the next person's turn."</p>
<p>"Oh right." Lilly nodded and watched as a small group of teens set themselves up with their microphones, adjusting the stands to their heights and grinning nervously at each other.</p>
<p>"So far so good, apart from one guy who tried to play the comb and paper along to 'Auld Lang Syne'…"</p>
<p>"Was it Jackson?"</p>
<p>Miley laughed and received a dirty look from her brother who had overheard, "Nah. The standard of the music was much better." Jackson frowned and turned back to his father to continue their conversation.</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and turned her attention briefly to the young group on stage, who were quickly surpassing her low expectations in their skills. "They're pretty good, and I <i>love</i> this Christmas track." Lilly squeaked as the teenagers hit the chorus.</p>
<p>Miley laughed appreciatively, "So far so good then? It seems we picked the right place to be on Christmas Eve."</p>
<p>"Yup." Lilly agreed and turned back to Miley, "Are you going to be getting on there tonight?" She asked casually.</p>
<p>Miley's eyes twinkled, "You'll just have to wait and see."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Lilly's mouth fell open slightly and she blinked whilst Miley took another leisurely sip from her drink, "Are you?" Lilly questioned more slowly.</p>
<p>Miley laughed, "Lilly, like I said you're gonna have to be patient and stick with the programme."</p>
<p>"I didn't know you could sing."</p>
<p>"Who said anything about singing? I'll have you know that the talent with the comb and paper runs deep through the veins of my family."</p>
<p>"You're so weird!"</p>
<p>"You love it."</p>
<p>Lilly blushed at Miley's remark, since the second word buzzed through her thoughts, causing her blood to heat and her stomach to swoop mercilessly. Lilly swallowed and took another hurried gulp of wine, "When are you up then?"</p>
<p>"Lilly, honey, don't hurry genius, you're just gonna stress me out and then I'll forget all the chords."</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes and knew that she wasn't going to get any further with Miley on this topic. The brunette was truly just as stubborn as she was but it was amusing to provoke her.</p>
<p>"Right," Miley took the final sip of her drink before setting her empty glass down, "I'm going for a bathroom break but I'll be right back."</p>
<p>Winking at Lilly, Miley stepped away from the bar and after a moment she was lost in the crowds, heading in the general direction of the toilets. Lilly sighed and tried to relax against the tall table where Miley's nuclear family was gathered. Robbie Ray grinned at her in a friendly manner whilst Jackson bobbed his head along in time to the music. Lilly felt shamefully shy to be among Miley's relatives, without the other girl near, but as much as she tried, the conversation just wasn't going to flow. Her tongue felt almost too big for her mouth as she pined away the moments without Miley near her, whilst growing every more uneasy over the fact that she couldn't help allowing this other girl to take over all of her emotions, albeit unknowingly.</p>
<p>"So, how's Miley <i>really</i> getting on with the whole skiing thing?" Jackson asked, and Lilly almost laughed to notice the cruel, elder brother, attempt to find some dirt on his unfortunate sister.</p>
<p>"Miley's really getting great." Lilly replied, boldly and flashed a confident smile at Jackson, hoping to send across the message that she was not to be questioned.</p>
<p>Jackson watched her through squinted eyes, "I don't believe you."</p>
<p>"Well, that's just your opinion then." Lilly argued back nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"It's nice to see that Miles has a friend that's willing to stick up for her." The southern tones of Robbie Ray had made themselves heard and Lilly smiled timidly back at him, "It was so lucky of her to have found you up here in these mountains… Almost like fate or something, as it's such a coincidence that you two go to the same school and all."</p>
<p>Lilly chuckled, "Strangely enough that's what my mum said when I told her the first morning we were here and I saw Miley."</p>
<p>Robbie Ray shrugged, "Maybe the lady's right. But, who knows? All I know is that I'm damned happy that you two found one another. Miley could really use a good friend; she's always so busy doing her homework and helping out round the house that she never finds time for herself."</p>
<p>"She's a loner."</p>
<p>"<i>Jackson</i>..." Robbie Ray growled warningly.</p>
<p>Lilly laughed, "Well, if it's any consolation I'm a bit of a loner too. My only friend really at the school is Oliver, and this other girl called Sarah, but I hang out a lot by myself surf-boarding and doing my own thing. I'm already looking forward to spending more time with Miley and finally getting her some form of a social life."</p>
<p>"I knew that girl was really a gonner when she started trying to hang out with me." Jackson confessed.</p>
<p>"That was when I was worried most of all – for her sanity and her health." Robbie Ray agreed.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>Lilly smiled and shook her head as father and son engaged in some friendly squabbling, since Christmas would never be the same without some family banter. Her eyes were drawn back to the stage where the teen-band members were finishing their set to the raucous cheers of the younger generation that had come to watch. Adults applauded politely and finally the space was free for the next act to perform.</p>
<p>It was just as Lilly was taking a sip from the glass of pale white wine that she held clenched in her hand, that the microphone squealed and the nearby crowd groaned, moving to cover their ears.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about that."</p>
<p>Lilly almost dropped her glass. She glanced up at once and her eyes fell upon her new-found friend, adjusting the microphone stand for herself. Miley grinned at the crowd and cleared her throat, "So, does everyone know <i>All I Want For Christmas…</i>?"</p>
<p>A cheer quickly rose up and the small audience assembled itself, with everyone in the vicinity turning their attention to Miley, who didn't seem to be phased by it at all. Lilly watched in wonder at the glow in Miley's eyes and at the natural way she stood in the centre of the small platform. The number of people in the room barely massed to sixty, yet Miley was acting as if she were about to perform to six-thousand.</p>
<p><i>I don't want a lot for Christmas, </i></p>
<p><i>There is just one thing I need…</i></p>
<p>Lilly's breath became stuck in her throat, somewhere, as she was exhaling. The voice, it was so familiar.</p>
<p>…<i>I don't care about the presents,</i></p>
<p><i>Underneath the Christmas tree…</i></p>
<p>Miley was smiling and she had every person in the room hushed into silence as they watched her, captivated on the lyrics she repeated from the old song and spun out for them now. The words meant something new to Lilly, even though she must have heard this song a hundred times before.</p>
<p>…<i>I just want you for my own.</i></p>
<p><i>More than you could ever know…</i></p>
<p>Lilly blinked, she could have sworn that Miley's eyes focused on her during that line. Blood flooded to her cheeks at the thought and she glanced down, mortified that she could make such an assumption.</p>
<p>…<i>Make my wish come true.</i></p>
<p><i>All I want for Christmas is you…</i></p>
<p>Miley kept singing and the crowd began to sway with her, the people in the room picking up on the energy she exuded as the music sped up. Miley was almost dancing with them as she continued and Lilly smiled as the mass moved around her. Yet there was something about Miley's voice that was niggling at a space in the back of her mind. It had started off small, at the beginning of the song, but now it was growing until it was all Lilly could think about.</p>
<p>…<i>All the lights are shining<br>
So brightly everywhere.<br>
And the sound of children's<br>
Laughter fills the air.<br>
And everyone is singing,<br>
I hear those sleigh bells ringing…</i></p>
<p>Miley now reached the final chorus and sang out the rest of the song. Lilly watched her, and saw how her eyes flickered back onto hers, as if daring Lilly to realise something. It was just as Miley finished and thanked her audience that Lilly's brain clicked.</p>
<p>"<i>I mean, you can't go wrong with a bit of Hannah Montana really can you?"</i></p>
<p>"<i>Do you like her?" Miley asked, and Lilly suddenly noticed that her face had assumed the same poker-face expression that she had adopted earlier, whilst touching Lilly's bruise.</i></p>
<p>This is a test… what do I say?<i> "Yes." Lilly replied bravely, "I mean I know she's mostly for kids, and it's kind of lame for a seventeen year old to like her music… But I just like the message her lyrics put across and they give people hope. Her songs could mean anything you want them to, and they always have the ability to cheer me up." Lilly glanced downwards in apparent shame but Miley only smiled warmly.</i></p>
<p>"<i>I like Hannah's music too."</i></p>
<p>"No way…" Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>Miley was making her way slowly through the groups of people stood around her, either congratulating her or throwing smiles in her direction.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Robbie Ray's voice broke into Lilly's thoughts as she stood and watched her friend laughing with some young girls.</p>
<p>"What?" Lilly turned her attention to him.</p>
<p>"Your face is pale." Robbie Ray was looking at her closely.</p>
<p>"Erm, yeah, must be the wine and the skiing or something." Lilly stammered out.</p>
<p>Jackson smirked at her, "And nothing to do with Miley's performance?"</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, swallowing as her throat went dry.</p>
<p>"Hey, sorry about all of that." Miley had emerged now and was taking a gulp of water from a glass her father had handed her, "Are you alright Lilly?" Miley asked as soon as her eyes landed properly on the other girl.</p>
<p>"I'm fine." Lilly replied tersely.</p>
<p>"You look sorta…"</p>
<p>"…Pale?" Lilly interjected, "That's what I heard. Apparently I'm not well." Lilly managed a small smile.</p>
<p>Miley smiled back, "What did you think of the performance?"</p>
<p>Lilly glanced at the company around her; all three Stewarts had their attention focused entirely on her, "Erm… It was enlightening. That's for sure."</p>
<p>"Interesting choice of words." Jackson said and Robbie Ray nudged him.</p>
<p>"Come on son, I think there's a hockey match on that we don't wanna miss." Robbie Ray grabbed Jackson by the scruff of his neck and directed him away.</p>
<p>Lilly was suddenly feeling very nervous and found herself unable to look at Miley. She chewed down on her bottom lip and turned her gaze to the floor. Miley remained silent beside her, only moving to sip from her water occasionally, and long minutes played out around them until Lilly looked up again.</p>
<p>"Miley? I think we need to talk about something…" Lilly found her voice was shaking and Miley looked alarmed for a moment.</p>
<p>"You're probably right." Miley replied once she had composed herself.</p>
<p>"Miley, what happened on stage, well, I just don't know what to say…"</p>
<p>Miley was shaking her head, "Not here Lilly." Miley muttered and Lilly's eyes widened. Then Miley was reaching for a bar napkin and a pen, "This is my room number." Miley was scribbling down on the paper and folding it in half, "Come here in thirty minutes and we'll talk about this."</p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>Lilly stood at the entrance to the elevator, watching as the digital box above the doors read out the floor numbers. She was wasting time letting the elderly couple take her lift, but she needed the space to think about what she now knew. Lilly was buzzing with a renewed energy. She had been drained of activity and sunk into lethargy after skiing, yet now her whole body was alive and her senses were tingling.</p>
<p>Turning away from the lift, Lilly stepped down the small hallway until she reached the back stairs. Here she began to climb and counted the steps as she did so, until her feet were moving too fast and the numbers became a blur and then fell apart.</p>
<p>Stopping on one landing, Lilly checked Miley's note again and confirmed it with the floor. This was her stop. She pushed open the fire-door and walked along the carpeted hallway, which was quiet since everyone was elsewhere, and it was late. <i>Almost Christmas Day</i>, Lilly thought to herself.</p>
<p>She tripped quickly down the hall and rounded a corner until she was two doors away from Miley's. <i>What am I doing?</i> Lilly asked herself and her heart beat all the more frantically for the question; she truly had no idea. But, there it was, Miley's room.</p>
<p>Lilly stood still to catch her breath. She counted to ten, and then to twenty, before cursing herself for her compulsions and halted. One more deep breath and then her hand was raised, poised to knock.</p>
<p>She tapped on the door five times until she heard soft footsteps on the other side and Miley was pulling the door open from within. "Hello Lilly." Miley's gravely voice called out to her and Lilly looked up from where her gaze had fallen nervously on her feet.</p>
<p>Miley looked exactly the same as she had before, nothing had changed; except every feeling within Lilly burnt and her emotions were raw.</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>Miley chewed down on her lower lip and for once she looked nervous. "Do you want to come in?" Miley's cheeks pinked and Lilly swallowed.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Miley moved back a little and Lilly stepped forward enough just to cross the threshold before they both stopped and Miley's door closed behind them.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?" Miley asked softly.</p>
<p>"I-I think so." Lilly stumbled and Miley raised a hand to brush some of her wild hair away from her face.</p>
<p>"What's up?"</p>
<p>Lilly took a deep breath, "I think we should just cut to the chase about this tonight."</p>
<p>Miley nodded, "I agree."</p>
<p>"Miley, you sang <i>All I Want for Christmas…</i>out there on the karaoke stage tonight."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Lilly dug her nails into her palms; this was going to be difficult. "Did you sing that song for me?" She asked and then cringed internally, she was being too forward and yet she couldn't help herself.</p>
<p>Miley nodded slowly, "I did."</p>
<p>"Because you wanted me to realise something." Lilly blabbered.</p>
<p>Miley merely bowed her head in acknowledgement, but kept her gaze level with Lilly's.</p>
<p>"Miley…" Lilly said slowly, "You're Hannah Montana."</p>
<p>Miley's eyes widened and she looked confused. Her eyes flickered above her quickly and then her lips parted and she met Lilly's eyes again, "Yes. I am Hannah Montana."</p>
<p>"I knew it." Lilly sighed and the burden she bore felt lighter, though it was only a minute difference in the total weight of it all. There was so much more she wanted to say – but she didn't dare voice the call of her hidden heart.</p>
<p>Miley shifted uneasily, and then she cleared her throat and her stance became strong again, "Lilly, there's something else you need to know about Hannah."</p>
<p>"What?" Lilly breathed.</p>
<p>Miley glanced down at the floor before tilting her head upwards once more to face Lilly with sparkling eyes, "Hannah Montana is gay."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Wow."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
<p>"Well…"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"I guess that's just going to mess with my girl-crush on her even more."</p>
<p>Miley's lips broke into a small, but nervous smile, "You have a crush on Hannah Montana?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." Lilly blushed, "It used to be quite bad too."</p>
<p>"<i>Used</i> to be?"</p>
<p>Lilly gulped because Miley had taken a step even closer. "I kinda like someone else now." Her hands were shaking.</p>
<p>"Lucky person."</p>
<p>"Lucky <i>girl</i>." Lilly stressed and daringly reached across to stroke Miley's wrist, before tentatively curling her fingers down into the palm of Miley's hand.</p>
<p>"Lilly…" Miley's voice was barely above a whisper now.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Lilly's voice had dropped also, mirroring Miley's in its quiet sound.</p>
<p>Miley inched ever nearer, "Look up."</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes flashed over Miley's questioningly for a moment before she followed the other girl's gaze. There, in the small hallway just inside Miley's hotel room door, and hanging from the ceiling was something green with little white beads of fruit…</p>
<p>"Mistletoe." Lilly sighed, and her eyes found Miley's once more, "But… why…?"</p>
<p>Miley smiled; her oceanic eyes were alive with a tumult of warmth that burned and quivered in her rising emotions which matched the nerves thrilling Lilly's being, "Because at Christmas you have to be daring, and tell the truth." Lilly still looked confused and Miley laughed softly, the very sound of it causing an eruption of goose-bumps all over the blonde's skin, "Lilly, Lilly…"</p>
<p>Lilly's mouth curved into a smile of its own as Miley's face edged ever nearer, and soon the other girl was becoming a smudging blur before her eyes, so she closed them. The next sensation Lilly knew was Miley's lips, brushing against hers before she coaxed herself out of her stunned state and started kissing Miley back. It was heaven standing like that in the warmth of Miley Stewart's presence, with the other girl's hands on the tops of Lilly's arms, perhaps to keep her from running away; because maybe Miley feared that she would. Lilly would never be able to run from this though. This was…</p>
<p>"Happy Christmas Lilly."</p>
<p>Miley's breath tickled Lilly's skin as she paused, leaving only a small space between their lips. Lilly felt giddy and almost forgot that she possessed the ability to speak, but she soon found it again, "Happy Christmas Miley." Lilly pressed their mouths together once more, somewhat clumsily and Miley giggled underneath Lilly's onslaught of kisses. "What?" Lilly asked as she pulled away and met Miley's laughing eyes.</p>
<p>"Nothing…" Miley's cheeks were tinged with pink excitement, "You just have <i>no</i> idea how long I've been waiting to kiss you."</p>
<p>"Well I never thought you'd have wanted to kiss me!" Lilly squeaked.</p>
<p>Miley shook her head, "Lilly, I've always thought you were cute at school but I've been too busy to be able to get to know anyone." Miley raised a hand to stroke Lilly's cheek, "At breakfast, that first morning here, that was when I knew I wanted you."</p>
<p>Lilly grinned, "You wanted me then?" Miley nodded and Lilly's smile widened further than she ever thought possible, "When I almost knocked you over in my hurry to get to the croissant mountain?"</p>
<p>"Yup."</p>
<p>"When my hair was messy, after I had only just woken up, and I was dressed in my weird comfortable clothes…"</p>
<p>"…What can I say? I'm a sucker for the dorky girls."</p>
<p>"Then I guess you can consider me your dork." Lilly's eyes widened, "Well, not that I'm yours, or you are mine. We're just two separate people who happen to like kissing each other, and you know, it's…"</p>
<p>"Lilly?"</p>
<p>"Yes Miley?"</p>
<p>"Just kiss me again."</p>
<p>It was just there, as Lilly Truscott stood in the humble setting of a hotel doorway, wrapped up in the arms of the girl she was growing to adore, that she felt something stir within her, far greater than the tug of light fancy for the Miley Stewart. This emotion was stronger; it felt like Christmas, but the kind of Christmas that would come every day, and would exist in the smallest of deeds that the two girls would undertake together.</p>

They taste like sparkling wine<br>
I feel so warm and loved<br>
Just 'cause I love you so</b></i></p>
