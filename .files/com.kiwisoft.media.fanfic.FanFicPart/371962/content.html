<p>I'm glad everyone is still enjoying this story, despite it being obvious what was going to happen. I normally try to be way more sneaky, but this was just supposed to be a fun, happy story. I'm sure before long I'll be back to writing about violence and mayhem, so enjoy it while it lasts ;) Thanks to all the awesome people who reviewed!</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter 5</b></p>
<p>"Maybe you were wrong. My water hasn't even broken."</p>
<p>Lilly glanced at the other girl skeptically. Miley was leaning against the corner, her face sweaty and tired. Despite nearly seven hours of what, to Lilly, seemed most certainly like contractions, Miley steadfastly hung onto the belief that she was not in labor. Lilly couldn't blame her exactly; this was not where she'd hope to have her baby, in an elevator with no professional help and someone who had taken a First Aid class months ago. She sighed and wrapped an arm around Miley's shoulders, pulling the girl against her. They'd gotten a lot closer over the past few hours and though Lilly had to admit she had a tiny crush on Miley, she'd managed to push it from her mind. All she wanted was to get Miley, and the baby, safely through this.</p>
<p>"It doesn't always right away. This is a good thing. If you can hang on another 12 hours or so, you can have this baby outside this prison."</p>
<p>Miley lifted her head from Lilly's shoulder, giving her friend a disparaging look. "You want me to continue enduring this horrible pain for another 12 hours?"</p>
<p>Lilly made a face, reconsidering. She had already determined she hated seeing her new friend in pain and certainly didn't want another 12 hours of it either. Lilly thought Miley was doing pretty well so far, though; there had been no screaming, no cursing, no throwing things or trying to crush her hand. She had let Miley dictate whatever happened and figured out quickly the girl didn't like to be touched during a contraction, but needed physical comfort right after. She had no idea how she was keeping herself together, when the mere thought of someone giving birth would have sent her running just a few days ago.</p>
<p>"Well, just tell Ronaldo to hurry it up then," said Lilly with a grin, earning a jab in the side.</p>
<p>"Stop giving my kid such horrible names." Miley rested her head back on Lilly's shoulder, curling into the other girl's side. She couldn't imagine having to do this on her own and though this wasn't going exactly like planned, she couldn't have asked for someone better to help her through this.</p>
<p>Lilly was silent, rubbing her hand across Miley's back in soothing strokes. She had never been a very touchy-feely person, another thing Joanie had hated about her, but something was different with Miley. Maybe it was her inability to deny her new friend, especially when she was in pain and scared. Or maybe Miley was just different all around.</p>
<p>"Are you excited to see him?"</p>
<p>Miley didn't need to ask to know whom Lilly was talking about. "Yeah. Excited and terrified all at the same time. Does that make sense?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, though she couldn't imagine what it would be like to have a baby at her age. Terrifying most certainly. "A lot of sense. Do you have everything ready for him?"</p>
<p>Miley snorted. "Please, my dad has had a nursery set up for months. It's like my whole family is going crazy; he is going to be so spoiled."</p>
<p>"That's 'cause he's going to be totally adorable."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. "Well, for one, 'cause he's yours and two, 'cause he's gonna be a famous soccer star."</p>
<p>"I'm making it my life's mission to ensure he will never see a soccer ball," said Miley threateningly, though she was laughing. She stiffened almost immediately after and moved back to her corner.</p>
<p>Lilly watched Miley trying to breathe through the pain and looked at her watch. The contraction didn't last long, but seemed almost endless to both girls. Miley sighed deeply once it was over and moved back to cuddle against Lilly's side. She'd normally never be so forward with someone she had just met, but she was desperate for comfort and physical affection and Lilly was nice enough to offer it.</p>
<p>"Your contractions are still more than five minutes apart and they haven't been that long, so I think you still have some ways to go," said Lilly, earning another jab in the side.</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'not that long'? <b>You</b> try and have contractions and then we'll see what's long and what's not."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled, though tried not to let the other girl see. "I thought you weren't in labor."</p>
<p>All she got was another jab in the side.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>Lilly's back was aching and her leg was asleep, but she refused to move an inch, looking down at her brunette friend stretched across her lap. Miley was dozing between contractions, though since they were now coming closer and closer together, she was getting little rest. Lilly absentmindedly ran her hand through Miley's hair just to have something to do and calm her own nerves. She'd known first-time labor could take a while, but 13 hours later and there seemed to have been little progress. Of course, she didn't know what progress looked like, other than there being a baby at the end.</p>
<p>Miley groaned and stiffened, one hand clamped impossibly tight around Lilly's shin. She didn't even bother moving off of Lilly, either too exhausted or too far gone to care. Lilly dutifully watched the time, noting that the contractions seemed to last longer now, though they were still well over five minutes apart. She knew neither of them was likely to get any sleep that night. Miley started shaking against her and Lilly realized she was crying.</p>
<p>"Miley?"</p>
<p>"I can't take it anymore," she said pitifully, tears evident in her voice. She sniffled. "And I think I peed my pants."</p>
<p>Lilly looked down at her along her body, and though it was hard to see with Miley's sideways position, her sweatpants did look wet. "I think your water broke."</p>
<p>Miley sat up, staring at Lilly in panic. "But doesn't that mean he's about to come? You said there was plenty of time. I'm not ready, Lilly."</p>
<p>"Miley," said Lilly, trying to sound as calm and reassuring as she could. "Calm down. Everything will be fine. He will come when he is ready and we'll be ready for him."</p>
<p>More tears leaked from Miley's eyes, but she brushed them away and nodded. "Yeah, thanks Lilly, for being here for me."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm just doing it so I can be there later and teach him how to play soccer."</p>
<p>Miley laughed through her tears. "Who says I'll even let you around him?"</p>
<p>"Well, it would be rude to deny the woman who delivered your son."</p>
<p>"What if we make it out of here first?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. "I guess then you get a reprieve. You want to stand up or walk around or anything?"</p>
<p>"I think I want to change out of these pants. I got some spare shorts in my backpack," said Miley and Lilly gave her a weird look, but nevertheless grabbed the backpack.</p>
<p>"Did you know you were gonna get stuck in an elevator or something? You seem awfully prepared."</p>
<p>Miley grinned and pulled a pair of large basketball shorts from her bag. "Jackson asked me to bring them and then he skipped his class."</p>
<p>"Do you need help?" asked Lilly as Miley sat up and moved to change her wet pants.</p>
<p>"Just turn around."</p>
<p>Lilly thought about telling Miley that, if things continued the way they were going, she'd soon enough be seeing all of her friend anyway, but decided to keep that to herself.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>"How about Romeo? Or Lucius?"</p>
<p>Miley gave Lilly a weird look. "Now I know you're joking."</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged, having exhausted her repertoire of baby names, but at least she'd managed to keep Miley distracted for a while. "A lot of people name their children after where they were conceived, or born."</p>
<p>"So what, bed or elevator?"</p>
<p>"Alright, how about 'five', for the floor we're on?"</p>
<p>"It'd be more like 'four and a half', since we're stuck between four and five. All these names suck." Miley sounded almost angry at the end and Lilly briefly wondered if she'd gone too far in her joking, but then noticed the brunette was at the beginning of another contraction. She was on her knees, hands wrapped tightly around the handrail, her forehead resting against her hands while she took deep breaths.</p>
<p>"Just breathe through it," said Lilly, though suddenly felt dumb for giving such horrible advice. Of course, Miley was going to breathe through it, she had been for the past 15 hours. Lilly kept an eye on the watch and the other on Miley, an incredible anxiety welling up inside of her during every contraction. She was now convinced she'd have to be the one to deliver this baby and she was terrified, though she wouldn't mention this to Miley.</p>
<p>The contraction seemed to ease and Miley relaxed again, though Lilly noticed her shivering. Her t-shirt was completely drenched with sweat and she was only wearing shorts and socks, leaving her legs bare. Lilly moved closer and rubbed a comforting hand across her friend's back.</p>
<p>"Are you cold? You can take your shirt off and put your sweatshirt back on," offered Lilly.</p>
<p>"You just want me to take my shirt off," said Miley softly and it took Lilly several moments to realize she was joking.</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's it. Come on, take it off. Do you want me to rub your back again?" Lilly held the zip-up sweatshirt out to Miley, who took it with a sigh. She felt horrible that Lilly had to do all this for her, a near stranger, and she bit her lip to keep from crying. Her Mamaw and Aunt Dolly were supposed to be with her when she gave birth, to hold her hand and dry her tears and comfort her when she was scared. Lilly seemed to notice the tears pooling in her eyes again and asked what was wrong.</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "I'm sorry, Lilly. I know you don't wanna have to do all this and have to deal with me. I'm really sorry. It's really okay if you're too uncomfortable and don't want to get near me."</p>
<p>"Well, granted, I'm a bit afraid of you 'cause of all the women I've seen give birth on TV, but I'm not uncomfortable, Miles. I know we hardly know each other, but I think after this we'll be best of friends, don't you?"</p>
<p>Miley laughed weakly and nodded. She pulled off her wet t-shirt and shrugged the sweatshirt back on, zipping it up. She was already exhausted and couldn't imagine doing this for several more hours. Miley felt Lilly's hands on her back and sighed heavily, resting her head against the wall.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>"A nice, juicy burger," sighed Lilly dreamily, earning herself a weird look.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Lilly turned her head to look at Miley lying down just next to her. She was still holding onto Lilly's hand, hadn't let go for almost an hour, in fact, but Lilly didn't mind despite the sweatiness. It was incredibly warm inside the elevator and Lilly had stripped off her long-sleeved shirt a while ago, leaving her in just her t-shirt and pants. Miley was sweating much more heavily though with the added stress of the labor. Lilly was terrified about having to possibly deliver the baby, but at this point she just wanted him to come to spare her friend more misery.</p>
<p>"The food I'm most looking forward to eating when we get out of here. What would be your pick?"</p>
<p>Miley grimaced. "I can't even imagine eating right now."</p>
<p>"But when we're out of here, after the little man has finally made his appearance. If you could get anything…"</p>
<p>Miley shifted to roll onto her back, but no matter how hard she tried she could not get comfortable. Even between contractions the ache in her back was driving her wild and the hard floor was not helping. She took a long time to think about it, but eventually answered Lilly's question. "Cheesecake. From that little bakery in the strip mall just across campus."</p>
<p>Lilly grinned. "Now you're playing. Anything else?"</p>
<p>Miley was quiet again for a few moments, but when she spoke her voice sounded almost forlorn. "I just want my baby to be okay and healthy."</p>
<p>Lilly turned onto her side and propped herself up so she could look down at her friend. She took Miley's hand again and squeezed it lightly. "He's going to be perfect. He's just taking this long because he's a star and they always have to make an entrance."</p>
<p>Miley smiled weakly at her and Lilly shrugged. "Or because he's a boy and he got lost and is refusing to ask for directions."</p>
<p>This finally got a laugh out of Miley and Lilly smiled. She checked her watch. "Look, it's after 5 am, we're gonna be out of here real soon, Miles."</p>
<p>Lilly had been keeping a close eye on the time all night and knew another contraction was due soon. She was proven right when Miley's hand clamped down tightly on hers.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>Lilly was utterly and completely panicked and as much as she was trying, she knew her face must be giving her away. She spread out Miley's poncho before her and stacked both their backpacks against the wall with shaking hands. She kept up a continuous mantra in her head of 'Stay calm, just stay calm', but had no idea if it was working. Lilly went up to Miley, who stood bent over, hands on the railing, while another contraction tore through her. She rubbed a tentative hand across her friend's back, while Miley took deep breaths, eyes screwed shut tightly.</p>
<p>"I'm not ready, Lilly." Miley's voice was full of pain and fear and Lilly took a deep breath to try and steady her own nerves.</p>
<p>"Yes, you are. And more importantly, <b>he's</b> ready. You do this however it feels most comfortable, okay? I'll be right here with you."</p>
<p>The contractions were now less than four minutes apart and lasting for over a minute each time and when Miley had told her she felt the urge to push, the panic had descended upon Lilly. But she knew she couldn't give into it and had quickly moved to set up the area to at least make it a little less unsanitary.</p>
<p>"I just wanna lie down," said Miley, exhaustion evident in her voice.</p>
<p>Lilly moved to help her, but stopped and blushed. "I uh…your shorts…"</p>
<p>Miley looked at her weirdly, before reaching for the waistband of her shorts. Lilly helped her push them down and then to sit on the poncho. She had Miley lean back against the backpacks and went to kneel in front of the other girl. Lilly was sweating heavily now, too, not from the heat, but the knowledge of what she was about to do. She was just a college student, she couldn't possibly be delivering a baby, but here she was. No matter how terrified she was, Lilly knew Miley needed her. She took a deep breath and with a sudden clarity she could see every step of childbirth taught in her class before her eyes. She put her hands on Miley's knees.</p>
<p>"When you feel like you need to push during the contraction, push as hard as you can."</p>
<p>Her voice was strong and confident, much to her surprise. Miley followed her instructions without comment; they were too far gone for jokes or complaints. Miley didn't scream, but the tears in her eyes and her groans let Lilly know how much pain she was in. Lilly had no idea how long this was supposed to take and once Miley began pushing time seemed to stop mattering. It wasn't until a third voice sounded in the elevator a while later that she broke out of her reverie, startled.</p>
