<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Twenty-Four -->

<p>Julie's  in New York City was full that night, sweaty bodies pressed together and moving  to the music. Strangers danced together and enjoyed themselves as the music  pumped into their ears and the drinks flooded their bodies. Noemí and  Terri made their way through the throng of women towards the dance floor, followed  closely by Martha and Tanya, then Victoria and Michaela. They found an area  at the perimeter of the dance floor where they could all stand comfortably together;  Victoria and Tanya went towards the bar to get some drinks.</p>
		<p>It was already  two in the morning, Michaela and Terri had insisted that they each be allowed  stop at home so that they could change into more comfortable clothes. Noemí  looked at Terri and thought her beautiful in the snug beige slacks and wool  sweater that she had donned at home, her shoes were feminine black leather boots  that Noemí had given her one day as a present. She had let her hair loose,  and it flowed loosely over her shoulders and down her back.</p>
		<p>Michaela had  changed into blue jeans, one of Victoria's white dress shirts worn open  over a tight black tank top and brown shoes. Victoria couldn't take her  eyes away from her, even as she stood with Tanya at the bar waiting for their  drinks, and Noemí noticed with a smile.</p>
		<p>Martha winked  at Noemí and turned to Tanya, taking the drinks from her hands and placing  them on the high table that they managed to find. She pulled her towards the  dance floor and into the throng of dancing women. Noemí watched as she  wrapped her arms around Tanya's neck and Tanya wrapped her arms around  Martha's waist, they held each other closely and dance slowly despite the  fast beat of the music.</p>
		<p>Noemí  felt a sudden urge to hold Terri and she grabbed her hand. She pulled Terri  towards the dance floor, smiling at Martha and winking back. Terri hesitated,  and looked around shyly; she'd never danced in public before, or with another  woman. As she moved to take her into her arms, Noemí sensed her discomfort  and paused, looking deeply into her eyes. "What's wrong?" She asked close  to her ear after a while, her hands on Terri's shoulders.</p>
		<p>"I've never  danced with another woman or in public, Noemí." Terri answered truthfully,  bringing her mouth close to Noemí's ear.</p>
		<p>Noemí  laughed softly, wrapping her arms slowly around Terri's slender waist and  pulling her close. "But you've made love with another woman, Terri." She  said, kissing her gently on the temple.</p>
		<p>"It's not  the same." Terri argued, pulling back to meet her eyes, her arms resting on  Noemí's broad shoulders.</p>
		<p>The smile in  Noemí's face was sensuous and patient at the same time. She brought  her lips close to Terri's ear and began to move her hips against hers.  "Yes," She breathed softly; feeling Terri's arms wrap slowly around her  shoulders, she heard Terri exhale shakily as she began to surrender to her.  "It actually is." She kissed below her earlobe very softly, dancing against  Terri. Her arms around her waist pulled them closer together and she pressed  her thigh between Terri's legs. "Just move your body against mine, be aware  only of me, of my movements." She whispered huskily, closing her eyes tightly  when Terri released a soft moaning breath. She brought her hands to Terri's  hips, grasping them gently and firmly at the same time pressing against her  and dancing.</p>
		<p>It didn't  take long for Terri's desire to ignite, or for her body to match Noemí's  sensuous movements. "You're a great dancer." She whispered into her lover's  ear, allowing her body to be guided by Noemí and their desire. Her arms  tightened around Noemí's shoulders and she ran her fingers slowly  through her hair, feeling Noemí's hot mouth kissing her throat.  "You're right," She gasped against the delicate skin of Noemí's  throat, gasping again when Noemí's arms tightened convulsively around  her. "Dancing <i>is</i> like making love. I want you <i>so much</i> right now!"</p>
		<p>Noemí groaned softly against  her shoulder, her eyes closed as she guided Terri in their dance, everything  else ceasing to exist as their love and desire took over.</p>
		<p>Michaela and  Victoria watched them from their table, uncomfortable in their silence. Victoria's  hand was on Michaela's shoulder, caressing gently. Michaela didn't  seem to acknowledge the touch. It had been a few weeks that Michaela had been  behaving coldly with Victoria, and Victoria knew it was because she still hadn't  expressed that she loved her with all her soul. But Victoria didn't know  how to, she'd never been the kind of person who talked of her feelings  in that way. From time to time, she glanced over at Michaela with a look in  her eyes that betrayed her feelings.</p>
		<p><i>I'm losing  her</i>, she thought to herself, the pain at the thought killing her inside.  <i>If I don't tell her I love her, she'll leave me. I can't loose  her, I can't!</i> "Michaela," She said close to Michaela's ear. Michaela  half-turned to look at her, question in her pretty eyes. Touched deeply by Michaela's  eyes, Victoria leaned forward again and said shakily, her voice breaking with  tears: "I need to speak to you."</p>
		<p>The way Victoria  said this made Michaela look at her for a long moment with narrowed questioning  eyes, trying to read her expression. The pain she saw there made her instantly  stand up and grab Victoria's hand, pulling her towards the front of the  bar. They walked past the bouncer, and stepped out the door. Outside, Michaela  pulled her a few feet away from the door of the bar and turned to face her,  meeting her eyes. "What is it, Vicky?" She asked softly, moving closer.</p>
		<p>Victoria wiped  the tears from her eyes and took a deep breath. Michaela waited for her to compose  herself, arms crossed in front of her as she stared at Victoria. Finally, Victoria  said, her voice still broken: "I'm loosing you."</p>
		<p>Their eyes met  momentarily and Michaela looked away. She didn't deny it, which hurt Victoria  more. She started to cry, turning away and wiping at the flowing tears on her  cheeks with the back of her hand. She began to walk away, but Michaela reached  out with a soft feminine hand, grasping her shoulder, pulling her into her arms.  Victoria's arms wrapped around her and she pulled her close. She buried  her face into Michaela's shoulder and cried like she never had, her shoulders  shaking. Michaela closed her eyes and wrapped her arms tightly around Victoria,  fingers brushing comfortingly through her hair. She couldn't stay withdrawn  from Victoria's pain, as she'd been for a few weeks.</p>
		<p>Victoria hands  were clawing at her back, pulling her impossibly close. Her shoulders shook  with her cries. "I love you!" She whispered raggedly, close to her ear. "I love  you <i>so much</i>!"</p>
		<p>Michaela burst  into tears herself, her nails sinking into the back of Victoria's shirt,  her mouth pressed against her neck. She held her for a long time, whispering  sweetly into her ear, comforting her.</p>
		<p>Victoria pulled  back a little, meeting Michaela's eyes. "You just have to love me too,  Michaela, you <i>have</i> to!" She croaked, biting her lower lip and closing  her eyes. "I love you, I just didn't know how to tell you. And then you  started to act cold towards me, and I didn't know what to do!" She pulled  her into her arms again and kissed her deeply, feeling Michaela respond eagerly,  tasting the salt of their tears.</p>
		<p>Feeling intensely  happy, Michaela kissed Victoria deeply, her body straining against her. Michaela  tore her lips away from her lover's to whisper in her ear passionately:  "I love you too, honey!" They kissed again, hard, wetly, breathing hard in the  middle of the sidewalk, not caring. "I love you so much!" She moaned against  her lips, eyes closed tightly, body trembling with happiness and desire.</p>
		<p>Victoria's  arms tightened almost painfully around her, and she pressed her face into Michaela's  throat, kissing the scented skin passionately. "Marry me!" She whispered with  a tiny moan, and Michaela gasped in surprise. "<i>Please</i> marry me!" Victoria  begged.</p>
		<p>"Yes!" Michaela  burst out loudly, happy like never before. She cupped Victoria's head and  pulled her back to kiss her mouth deeply. "I'll marry you, I'll marry  you!" She mumbled against her lips as they kissed.</p>
		<p>Victoria pulled  back and yelled, laughing and crying at the same time: "She'll marry me!  She'll marry me! Ha!" She never knew love could feel this way, when free  and known. The happiness coursed through her body and she began to cry out with  happiness, burying her face into Michaela's shoulder and shaking.</p>
		<p>They stood outside,  holding each other for a long, long time, until their companions emerged looking  for them, concerned. Upon finding out the good news, Noemí happily ushered  everyone back inside, intent upon treating them all to a drink and celebrating.</p>
		<p>Before the door  even closed, Noemí had pulled Terri into her arms, taking possession  of her lips with a passionate kiss. Desire instantly re-ignited within Terri,  the wetness between her legs grew intensely, and she wrapped her arms tightly  around Noemí's neck. Their lips danced together passionately, their  bodies strained together as they lost control of their desires. Terri moaned  into Noemí's mouth, her body quivering against hers as they yanked  off their coats and threw them down carelessly.</p>
		<p>Bending her legs,  Noemí wrapped and tightened her arms around Terri's waist; she then  straightened her legs and lifted Terri clear off the floor. Moaning again, Terri  lifted her legs and wrapped them around Noemí's waist, hearing her  moan deep in her throat. Their breathing grew erratic as Noemí made her  way towards the couch, where she sat down on the edge, holding Terri to her  tightly. Terri pulled against the back of Noemí's sweater, pulling  it upwards until Noemí took her arms from around her and frantically  yanked it over her head, throwing it down somewhere. Terri lifted her arms in  submission when Noemí pushed her sweater upwards, baring her beautiful  slender torso and round hanging breasts.</p>
		<p>With a loud animal-like  groan, Noemí took a nipple into her mouth and sucked it passionately  but gently. Terri's head fell back and she moaned, her hips jerking against  Noemí's stomach. Noemí rushed to her feet, unbuttoning her  slacks quickly and yanking them and her underwear down to the floor. Terri stepped  out of the pants and trembled when Noemí slid her fingers through the  silken wetness between her legs with a low moan. Terri's legs weakened  and she sat astride Noemí; legs opened wide to allow the slender fingers  access to her heat.</p>
		<p>With a groan,  Noemí slipped her fingers inside Terri, who arched and tensed as her  breath caught. "Mm, Noemí!" She gasped, riding the fingers deep inside  her, undulating her hips to meet the deep thrusts. Suddenly, Noemí stopped,  taking her fingers away and wrapping her arms around Terri's waist. She stood,  lifting Terri easily with her and felt her wrap her legs around her waist again,  the intense wetness pressing against her stomach. She made her way quickly to  their bedroom, her arms holding Terri up as Terri hung onto her with all her  strength.</p>
		<p>Terri lay on  her side, breathing hard, her head resting against Noemí's muscled arm.  She could feel Noemí's strong and smooth body pressed against her back  and legs. She could feel her strong hand between her legs, still stroking her,  as her silky lips caressed the back of her throat. She brought her arm up and  around Noemí's neck, pulling their mouths together in a passionate kiss.</p>
		<p>Noemí  loved the way Terri felt against her body, the way her sweet smell mingled with  the ripe scent of their sex and the bar, the smoothness between her legs yielding  to her fingers. She could feel Terri's hips writhing, her body trembling, as  she slipped a finger deep inside her wetness. She pressed her palm hard against  her swollen clitoris and heard her release a long moan. "Terri," She whispered  against her mouth, feeling the heat filling her own body from where her skin  met Terri's. "Oh God, Terri. I love you!" She groaned loudly and began to move  inside her, pressing her body against her back.</p>
		<p>Terri arched,  moaning as she felt Noemí's tongue imitating the movements of her fingers.  She felt ready to explode, tightening more and more around her; she pulled away  from her mouth to stare into her eyes. The love and passion in Noemí's  eyes excited her more. She closed her eyes and began to tremble as her abdomen  muscles fluttered in a prolonged orgasm.</p>
		<p>They held each  other under the spray of the shower; their lips made love the way their bodies  did. "I can't get enough of you." Noemí whispered huskily against her  throat, her hands caressing her smooth back and hips.</p>
		<p>Terri's arms  were around her neck, and she pulled her mouth to her own. "I don't <i>want</i>  you to ever get enough of me." She breathed, meeting her lips again. They kissed  for a long moment.</p>
		<p>"Mm, I don't  think you have to worry about that." Noemí whispered hotly against her  mouth, her hands cupping her buttocks and pulling her close. She felt Terri  lift her leg against her waist, and she pulled her up, feeling her wrap both  legs around her waist.</p>
		<p>Terri moaned,  burying her fingers in Noemí's hair, her arms on her shoulders. The heat  between her legs was driving her wild and she drove herself forward against  Noemí's hard stomach. "You make me want you so much!" She gasped as Noemí  moaned and responded to her passion.</p>
