<!-- The Closet \ Part Thirteen -->

<p>"Oooooh, now this is what I'm talking about!" Brooke exclaimed
excitedly in a somewhat sing song voice.  As she ran her eyes over the
paper sitting in her lap.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked looking over at her curiously.  Brooke had been
quiet for the better part of twenty minutes as she flipped through
Sam's notes.  Occasionally she had asked her a question or two but for
the most part she had been keeping herself busy, leaving Sam ample
time to take in their quaint surrounds and to practice not staring at
Brooke.</p>

<p>Brooked smiled and looked down at the piece of paper she had just been
looking at.  "'I had the dream again last night'," she began grinning
as she read the words Sam had written.  "A very promising beginning,"
she continued winking at Sam.  In fact she was so caught up in the
excitement of possibly learning about some of Sam's naughty bits that
she didn't see the brunette's face immediately fall, or the pained
expression that settled on it soon after.</p>

<p>"Give that to me," Sam stated as she reached out for the piece of
paper.  Silently she cursed herself, how could see have been so
stupid.  That morning she had been so preoccupied with thoughts of
Brooke that she had taken a few free minutes after breakfast to write
her thoughts down in hopes that it would get them out of her head.
Once she had finished she had just shoved the paper in with the rest
of her stuff, the stuff she handed over to Brooke.</p>

<p>"Grabby, grabby," Brooke responded playfully as she stood up so that
Sam couldn't yank the paper out of her hand.  "Come on, it's not so
bad.  Maybe I'll tell you mine…since I'll know your in a minute."</p>

<p>"I'm serious Brooke, give it to me," Sam stated standing as well.  She
reached for the paper again but Brooke blocked her with her body,
turning her back to Sam using her free arm as blocker while held the
paper with her other arm as she read it.</p>

<p>Sam continued to struggle with Brooke, trying to find away around the
blonde's body so that she could get the paper back, but Brooke
determinedly blocked her again and again.  Still, Sam couldn't give
up, the thought of giving up and just letting Brooke read a diary
entry that she made wherein she talked, and talked, and talked about
the feelings she had for Brooke just wasn't an option for the
brunette.</p>

<p>"I'm…I finished," Brooke said finally lowering her arm and relaxing
her stance.  Immediately Sam yanked the paper out of her hand, and
they stood there watching each other.  "Do you really think I have
skin like silk?" Brooke asked finally.</p>

<p>Sam watched the blonde in a kind of stupor that was only broken when
Brooke spoke.  She heard the blonde's question, but it seemed distant,
like it was coming from far, far away.  She was having trouble
breathing.  Brooke had actually read the entire the entry, she had
read it all, she knew everything.  Sam turned and began to walk
towards the door.  She realized that there was no place to go, but she
knew that she had to at least separate herself from Brooke.  She
figured Brooke would probably be grateful for the distance.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Brooke said as Sam started to walk away, quickly moving behind
her and grabbing her gently by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why? So you can mock me some more?" Sam asked not turning around.
She could feel the sting of tears in her eyes but she wouldn't give
Brooke the satisfaction of seeing her cry.  She couldn't.</p>

<p>"I was just," Brooke started hopelessly.  "I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have," she continued trying to work through her jumbled up thoughts.
"We were having fun," she continued softly, her hands still resting on
Sam.  "I was just," she went on stroking Sam's shoulders
unconsciously.</p>

<p>"Please let go of me," Sam said interrupting Brooke's babbling, her
voice remaining calm through nothing more than will power.</p>

<p>"Do you really want me to?" Brooke asked.  She could feel the warmth
of Sam's skin through her shirt, she could feel it warming her hands,
and the scent of lavender, Sam's scent, had infiltrated her olfactory
senses.  She was hyper of everything that had to do with Sam, her
smell, her feel, her breathing.</p>

<p>"That's not funny," Sam responded.  She could feel herself beginning
to crumble, she needed Brooke to let her go.  She couldn't feel Brooke
against her and remain strong, remain standing.  She needed distance.</p>

<p>"It wasn't suppose to be," Brooke responded moving closer to Sam, so
that now she was almost pressed up against the brunette's back.  "Do
you?  Really want me to stop touching you?  Because I don't want to
stop."</p>

<p>"Brooke please," Sam said, she was begging, begging Brooke to stop
torturing her, to just let her go.  She was begging and she didn't
care because she was moments away from breaking down.  Why couldn't
Brooke have just freaked out like a normal person?  Why was she doing
this, teasing her with something she couldn't have?</p>

<p>"I'm serious Sam…Sammy," Brooke breathed out softly.  Still holding
onto Sam she moved around so that she was standing in front of the
brunette.  "Lately," she began again in her new position, her hand
slowly traveling up Sam's shoulder, "I've…what I mean is…ugh," she
sighed in frustration, and closed her eyes trying to pull herself
together.  She placed her hands on the sides of Sam's face, and dipped
her head slightly so that she was looking directly into Sam's big,
beautiful, brown eyes.  "You smell like lavender, when you're bored
you stick you tongue into your cheek and when you're excited her rub
your teeth with it.  You can write with both of your hands, and your
eyes have the most incredible little gold specks in them that
absolutely break my heart.  I know what you're feeling Sam, I know,"
Brooke said her voice cracking along the way.  "Because I'm feeling it
too."</p>

<p>Sam looked away, down at the dusty floor as Brooke finished speaking.
 Her face was wet, she hadn't even realized she had been crying.  She
was overwhelmed.  She had just heard everything she had ever dreamed
about hearing, but it didn't seem real, she wondered if her alarm
clock were about to off.  But then she felt it, warm fingers tilting
her head back up, forcing her to meet Brooke's equally teary gaze.
She was confused, Brooke had never cried in her dreams.</p>

<p>They stayed like that for long moments, staring into each other eyes,
until finally Brooke impulsively leaned forward and softly, tenderly
pressed her lips against Sam's, drawing the brunette into her body as
their lips moved against each other.  Sam's body shook gently as she
felt Brooke's lips, tasted her for the first time.  Her hands wound
their way around Brooke's waist, clutching at her as the kiss deepened
and their bodies pressed closer together, their kiss becoming salty as
their tears ran down their faces.</p>
