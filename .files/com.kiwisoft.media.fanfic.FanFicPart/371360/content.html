<p><b>I'm kind of ashamed to be a part of a community full of spineless jellyfish. </b></p>
<p><b><hr size=1 noshade></b></p>
<p>I woke up to an immense throbbing in my limbs. The aroma of blood was thick in the air, as if the noxious particles that lingered had expanded with the intent of making my lungs burn and stomach lurch. I felt ill, stiff, like I needed to throw up all the poisons within my body and expel the harmful disease that threatened to end me. But... how could I possibly expel myself? What Oliver cursed me with was now just an addition to my identity, to what I was, and any action taken in an attempt to change it would be fruitless.</p>
<p>Every joint clenched as I tried to roll over onto my back, but the unkind wind whipped at my open wounds, longing to cause more pain, more problems. Nature was cynical at heart. It cleansed the world with a brutal tempest that could be as equally gentle, and then it would create deformities, but only humanity labelled them as such. It turned people against one another by bestowing differentiation upon every individual, but in a way that was rejected because of our innate fear of change, of things that weren't the same.</p>
<p>I was at a loss. Everything had happened so suddenly. Oliver's arrival, Miley's discovery. I hadn't even gotten a chance to catch up with it all and somehow, I ended up being marked with bruises and biting gashes that didn't even compare to the agony of betrayal. Oliver betrayed me by turning me, and Miley betrayed me by misleading me with her wordless promises.</p>
<p>Miley's dangerous stare flashed in my mind and I lucidly recalled her hateful words, her strikes, and her tear filled eyes. She really believed I had raided her farm and hurt Blue Jeans. She didn't stop to consider another wolf could have done it, she just jumped to conclusions and pointed the finger at me because I was the more likely suspect after being banished.</p>
<p>I knew she wouldn't let me near her again because of everything and it was all Oliver's fault. Or maybe it was my fault. I let myself get attached after I experienced the loving caress of companionship, but perhaps it was foolish to permit my ever growing bond with Miley to proceed into foreign territory. Maybe we weren't meant to be friends.</p>
<p>I briefly touched the collar around my neck, now loose and caked with blood. I used the gift as a vessel, hoping it would help in my search for an answer, a course of action, something that would tell me to get up from the ground and make amends. But the leather beneath my fingertips offered no guidance and I watched the darkened sky slowly being dotted with stars.</p>
<p>I had morphed into my human state again, which seemed to happen automatically when I wasn't conscious. I was bare to the world, stripped of pride, of love, of all that I once had and abused. Why did I ever turn from my mother's arms when she needed an embrace from her only daughter? Why did I run? I could have stayed, could have been imprisoned and used for testing. They could have found a <i>cure</i>. Or they could have used me as a lab rat to illuminate their studies. After all, I was a myth come to life. I was the evolutionary mutant of a creature capable of changing shape, size and species.</p>
<p>I shouldn't exist.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Miley ~</p>
<p>I hated myself for what I did. I was frazzled from the moment I found Lilly naked in my bed and when I saw Blue Jeans, I didn't know what to do. I didn't believe Lilly would do such a terrible thing, so after I tended to my horse and helped clean up the barn, I set out to find her. I needed to make sure she wasn't involved in the killing frenzy. I couldn't admit to myself that it was a strong possibility. I mean, everything was and wasn't possible to me now. If werewolves weren't just a legend, then was every other tale true as well? Was everything real? Or was it fake? Was civilisation just a lie and an idea that we believed in?</p>
<p>I was puzzled, to say the least, but I wasn't as repulsed as I first was when I found out about Lilly's secret. I was actually more startled to be touching her in an inappropriate place when I awoke... And I sent her away because I needed time to think, to try and understand, but then I came across her covered in blood, and realised my subtle hunch was correct. Lilly lost control and took it out on the animals, on Blue Jeans. I didn't intend to react the way I did, but I couldn't see past my own rage and went berserk.</p>
<p>I regretted it. I could still vividly picture the fear in her eyes, the fragility of her stance, everything. She let me hurt her. She didn't oppose and just accepted the punishment and it made me wonder if I was missing something, if there was another piece to the story. Did I really believe Lilly did this? Or did I merely want someone to blame?</p>
<p>I wanted to remove these thoughts from my head, but they clung there and replayed again and again. I closed my eyes tightly and all I could see was Lilly writhing on the ground, whining, but not resisting. The prominence of my guilt was daunting. I wanted to search for Lilly and tell her it would be alright, that I was still her friend, but fear prevented me from doing so. Fear of what she was capable of. If she was able to kill so many animals, there wasn't much stopping her from killing me out of spite, or even daddy or Jackson.</p>
<p>But then I realised something. If she didn't make any move to attack me when I was kicking her, why would she now? Did she want to harm me? Is she even still alive?</p>
<p>More questions arrived with the promise of insanity, so I climbed off of my bed, needing to take my mind off of things. It was dark out, but I wasn't bothered with taking any precautions as I grabbed a flashlight from my drawer and headed outside to the barn. Blue Jeans was going to recover, the wound on his front leg was only minor. He would suffer from a limp for a few weeks, but after that, he could be ridden again. It's one of the reasons I felt even worse for what I did to Lilly. She didn't hurt him as much as I thought she did, so my way of vengeance was unnecessarily harsh.</p>
<p>I shone the flashlight into the night, the beam faintly touching the trees, forming a transparent circle of white on the trunks as I peered beyond them, hoping, wondering. Was Lilly still out there? I studied the misted blackness for a short while, thinking she might suddenly appear, but then, so could anything else. Aware of the possible dangers, I turned away and continued towards the barn that resided a short distance from my house.</p>
<p>I eased open one of the doors and slipped inside, searching for the light switch. There was only one light bulb situated on the ceiling of the barn because we rarely needed to come here during the night. It was, however, very useful for when there had been a few emergencies, such as spooked horses during a storm, or the occasion fox trying to make off with one of the hens while it was still dark out.</p>
<p>I kept the flashlight on, needing its extra light to assure Blue Jeans of his safety, and I carefully walked towards him. His ear twitched and his head nodded slightly with recognition. I smiled and stroked his muzzle affectionately, eternally grateful for his survival.</p>
<p>He then stomped his hoof and inhaled sharply, aiming his stare past me. Shocked by his change in demeanour, I twisted around to locate the cause of his restlessness.</p>
<p>A wolf was poised at the opening of the barn. Its eyes, a deep brown colour, analysed me in a bone-chilling way. The disdain was evident as its lips curled back and a rumbling growl awoke all the animals. They grunted and whinnied and I stood frozen as the unknown wolf travelled deeper into the barn. It came at me, emitting deadly snarls as it finally crouched to the ground, as if preparing to pounce at me.</p>
<p>I shielded my eyes with my arms as it leapt, waiting to be mauled. The air was tense and sounds of movement from the horses and cows seemed to falter as I counted down in my head. If I died here, I knew for a fact I would be trapped in a perpetual limbo. There were so many unresolved things in my life, so much I hadn't experienced that without the contentment of completion, I would never have the privilege to truly pass on.</p>
<p>But, most importantly, I wished I had of given Lilly a chance.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a loud yelp sounded and was followed by a crash and the uproar of snarls and barks. I lowered my arms and found Princ-Lilly ripping into the brown wolf, unveiling a ferocity that terrified me. Lilly was still painted with blood, and it seemed the other wolf had past injuries not yet healed either. They removed the scabs and skin once more. Clawing, biting, destroying.</p>
<p>They fought ruthlessly and Lilly was gradually collapsing more often, her bloodied body trembling whenever she rose. I couldn't stand seeing her like that and crept towards a shovel that was leaning against the barn's back wall. I picked it up and Lilly met my eyes. As she nodded, the brown wolf snapped at her throat. Its rear was facing me and I threw myself forward, delivering an agile swing of the shovel to the back of its leg.</p>
<p>The wolf cried out, but the strangled noise morphed into an enraged roar as it spun around and jumped at me. I swung the shovel again and the edge dug into its shoulder, sending the savage creature back to the ground. It sprung to its feet quickly and launched itself again, but this time my reflexes were sluggish and I knew I would miss.</p>
<p>The intent to kill was clear in its eyes, but before the outstretched paws reached me, Lilly intervened, caught the wolf by the scruff of its neck, and shook it violently once she'd landed. Shrill sounds of protest came from Lilly's opponent and when she released it, the rabid wolf scurried out of the barn and out of sight.</p>
<p>Lilly stood panting, watching the door for any signs of a rematch, but a far off howl echoed through the night and that seemed to appease her. She turned to me, her gaze curious and her ears lowered. I now knew the truth and even after the false accusation and undeserved punishment, Lilly still chose to return and protect me.</p>
<p>I raised my hand and beckoned her softly to come to me. She obeyed and hopped closer, one paw folded up as she walked, clearly injured.</p>
<p>Just before my fingers grazed her head, daddy appeared at the barn's entrance, shotgun in hand. He spotted Lilly and lifted the gun.</p>
<p>"Daddy! No!" I screamed.</p>
<p>He fired.</p>
