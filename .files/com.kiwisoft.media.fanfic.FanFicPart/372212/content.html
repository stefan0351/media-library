Oh, for those of you who read my latest oneshot, "Part of Her World"... I've decided I AM going to develop it into a full story :)</b></p>
<p><b>Oh, and by the way... the name of this chapter comes from the song of the same name, sung by Billy Ray Cyrus (usually with Miley). I've always liked it, and thought it was very appopriate to what happens here :)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER TWENTY</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">READY, SET, DON'T GO</p>
<p>"Can you believe we're <i>finally</i> getting out of here?" Lilly exclaimed happily, jumping up and down excitedly in front of her best friend. Miley looked at her and grinned.</p>
<p>"I know, Silly," she answered simply.</p>
<p>"C'mon Miles, you could be just a <i>little</i> more excited!" Lilly continued. "Twelve horrific years of public education finally come to an end <i>tonight</i>!"</p>
<p>"Thirteen," Miley corrected with a grin. "Don't forget about kindergarten."</p>
<p>"Kindergarten doesn't count," Lilly countered, sticking out her tongue. "It was actually <i>fun</i>… and quit changing the subject!" Miley's grin grew wider.</p>
<p>"School wasn't that bad," she insisted. "I think I'm actually gonna miss this place." Lilly responded by reaching out and resting a hand gently on her girlfriend's forehead.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling all right?" she asked mock-seriously. "Those are not the words of a well person!"</p>
<p>"I'm fine, goofball," Miley laughed, pulling Lilly's hand away. "It's just all gone by so fast."</p>
<p>"Maybe," Lilly allowed, "but the best is yet to come, Miles… and we get to experience it all together!"</p>
<p>"I know," Miley said sweetly. "Just try to slow down enough so I can enjoy it with you, okay?" She smiled then, and Lilly felt her heart melt.</p>
<p>"It's a darn good thing you're cute," Lilly said softly, her eyes sparkling as she drew closer to Miley. "I don't slow down for just anyone, you know."</p>
<p>"I could make it worth your while," Miley purred.</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me," Lilly whispered back. She leaned in and kissed Miley gently on the lips, then reached down to take her hand.</p>
<p>"Much as I hate to stop this, we'd better go… Jackson's gonna be here to pick us up any minute, and we need to have time to get ready for tonight."</p>
<p>"I know," Miley replied softly. "I guess he's really come around, huh? He wouldn't even talk to us before… now he's offering us rides home!"</p>
<p>"He probably just doesn't wanna get grounded by your dad," Lilly teased. Miley laughed and they walked out to the front of the school together to wait for their ride.</p>
<p>"He should be here any minute," Lilly remarked, noticing Jackson's car was not yet where he said he'd meet them.</p>
<p>"Guess that means we get to have some more alone time then," Miley said with a grin. They sat down together near a large, gnarled oak tree and began to talk about the evening's activities. After the graduation ceremony itself, they were supposed to return to the Stewart home for a big graduation party. Miley was looking forward to seeing her Mamaw and Aunt Dolly again, and was excited to just be able to relax and have fun with the people she loved.</p>
<p>"Don't you two ever get tired of disgusting the rest of us?" an angry voice called out, ruining their moment together. Miley & Lilly looked up to see Heather Addison, the most popular girl in school, and her usual followers standing nearby. She was well aware of her own popularity and never let anyone forget it; she also seemed to think it was her job to put everyone who wasn't her in their 'place'. Unlike most of their class, who had for the most part accepted Miley & Lilly's relationship, Heather Addison took every opportunity to put them down and call them names.</p>
<p>"Don't you have another jock to go sleep with?" Lilly shot back. "I think there's still one or two you missed."</p>
<p>"Watch it, Truscott," Heather growled. "I know you're just jealous because <i>I</i> can actually get a man."</p>
<p>"If anyone's jealous around here, it's you, Heather," Miley spoke up, jumping to her best friend's defense. "You know you'll never have someone who loves you for who you are. You don't even have any real friends! People only like you because they think you're popular… or because you'll sleep with them!"</p>
<p>"I think you need to be taught a lesson, Stewart," Heather Addison hissed, her voice low and dangerous. She started forward, her would-be friends still following her, but another voice stopped her cold.</p>
<p>"Leave them alone," a quiet male voice interrupted. Miley turned to see her older brother Jackson standing nearby. She had been so wrapped up in the argument, she hadn't even heard him drive up.</p>
<p>"Hiding behind your big brother, Stewart?" Heather taunted Miley.</p>
<p>"I think you better go now, Addison," Jackson cut her off, "before I have to remind you about your <i>own</i> big brother." Heather's older brother, Tom Addison, had once been a big man on campus… until he was busted for dealing drugs and sent to prison. For someone like Heather, who valued her popularity above all else, having a brother in jail was a major embarrassment and a very sore subject.</p>
<p>"When's the last time you visited him?" Jackson continued grimly. "I hear Green Mountain Penitentiary's a real nice place." Heather opened her mouth to say something, but no words would come. Finally, defeated, she turned to leave, but not before fixing all three of her would-be enemies with a menacing glare.</p>
<p>"Whatever," she muttered darkly. "You two freaks aren't even worth it." Then she was gone.</p>
<p>"Wow," Lilly whispered. "Am I crazy, or did your brother just stand up for us?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Miley replied, sounding equally stunned. "I think he did." She looked over at Jackson, who seemed uncomfortable with the sudden attention.</p>
<p>"Nobody picks on my little sister except me," he said simply, "or her girlfriend." Miley stared at her brother for a long moment, struggling to find the right words. Then, abruptly, she walked over and engulfed him in a huge hug.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I just want you to be happy," Jackson managed. He was surprised when Lilly suddenly joined in their embrace, also hugging him fiercely.</p>
<p>"We love you, Jackson," Miley said softly, fighting back tears.</p>
<p>"I love you too," Jackson replied quietly. "Just keep it between us, okay? I don't want dad to think we're actually getting along!" Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we can't have that," she quipped. Jackson finally extricated himself from the group hug and took a step back, pausing for a moment to straighten your hair.</p>
<p>"So how 'bout we head home now?" he suggested. "You two'll probably need lots of time to get ready." Miley arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"What are you trying to say, Jackson?" she asked him. Jackson immediately held his hands up in a gesture of surrender.</p>
<p>"I just know how long girls can take to get ready," he said quickly. "I mean c'mon, how many years have I had to share a bathroom with you?"</p>
<p>"At least I don't pollute the place," Miley muttered, but she smiled a little as she said it.</p>
<p>"What do you call those girly lotions and things you keep in there?" Jackson countered.</p>
<p>"And we're back to normal!" Lilly quipped, instantly relaxing the tension beginning to build between the two siblings. Miley laughed and Jackson smiled sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess we are," Miley replied, grinning.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"I swear, I don't know how you did it all, Susie," Robbie Ray Stewart whispered to himself as she struggled to scrub a stubborn stain off of the kitchen countertop. Try as he might though, the stain refused to budge.</p>
<p>"Cleaning just ain't my strong point!" he grumbled.</p>
<p>"Having fun, daddy?" a familiar female voice called out to him.</p>
<p>"Tons," Robbie Ray said dryly. "I tell you, there are times I wish your momma had left instructions for me." He looked up at his daughter then, and was stunned when he saw the beautiful young woman standing in front of him. Miley was wearing a simple white blouse and a pair of black slacks. Her long brown hair cascaded down her back like a soft auburn waterfall, and her eyes sparkled from beneath just the slightest amount of eye shadow.</p>
<p>"Sweet niblets," Robbie Ray managed.</p>
<p>"Come on, daddy, it's just a blouse and slacks," Miley replied, smiling a little. "It's not even showin' anything off!"</p>
<p>"It's not that, bud," Robbie Ray continued, tossing the rag he'd been using in the sink. "It's just…" He swallowed, an unexpected lump suddenly forming in his throat.</p>
<p>"It's just what, daddy?" Miley asked him, beginning to feel slightly nervous.</p>
<p>"When did you get so grown up?" Robbie Ray replied simply. Miley felt tears already beginning to sting her eyes.</p>
<p>"I thought I was gonna see my little girl standin' there… but instead there's this beautiful young woman in front of me," her father continued. "Did I really miss that much?" Miley walked silently over to her father, stopping just in front of him.</p>
<p>"You didn't miss anything, daddy," she said softly. "I guess I am grown up now, though." Robbie Ray chuckled.</p>
<p>"Pretty soon you'll be goin' off to start your own life, and leavin' your old daddy behind," he said with a sad smile. "I swear, where have all the years gone?"</p>
<p>"They sure went by fast, didn't they?" Miley agreed wistfully.</p>
<p>"<i>Too</i> fast," Robbie Ray said quietly. "It just doesn't seem possible… that my little girl's grown into a woman already."</p>
<p>"Oh, daddy…" Miley wrapped her arms around her father and squeezed him in a warm hug. "I'll <i>always</i> be your little girl… I promise." Robbie Ray hugged his daughter back fiercely, not wanting to let go, but knowing he would have to.</p>
<p><i>She's gotta do what she's gotta do</i></p>
<p><i>And I've gotta like it or not</i></p>
<p><i>She's got dreams too big for this town</i></p>
<p><i>And she needs to give 'em a shot</i></p>
<p><i>Wherever they are</i></p>
<p><i>Looks like she's all ready to leave</i></p>
<p><i>Nothin' left to pack</i></p>
<p><i>Ain't no room for me in that car</i></p>
<p><i>Even if she asked me to tag along</i></p>
<p><i>God I gotta be strong…</i></p>
<p>"Besides, you're gonna see so much of Lilly and me, especially with the Hannah thing, you'll probably get sick of us!" Miley said lightly, hoping to cheer her father up. After a long moment, a mischievous smile began to slowly spread across his face.</p>
<p>"That mean I can still take a switch to you when you sass your old man?" he asked teasingly. Miley giggled.</p>
<p>"You have to catch me first," she retorted playfully.</p>
<p>"Did I miss something?" Lilly asked aloud. Miley turned slightly in her father's embrace to see the woman she loved standing near the door to the garage, and immediately her face lit up in a joyous smile. Her expression did not escape her fathers notice, and he too smiled.</p>
<p>"Just a little father-daughter bonding," he said warmly. "I think there's plenty of room over here for you too, Lilly." Lilly blushed slightly.</p>
<p>"That's okay, daddy; we should probably get going soon," Miley pointed out. He smiled and nodded, and Miley walked over to squeeze Lilly in a hug of their own.</p>
<p>"Let me get cleaned up a bit and we'll get going," Robbie Ray told them. Miley nodded and watched him walk towards his bedroom, then she turned back to her best friend.</p>
<p>"Missed you," she whispered softly to her lover.</p>
<p>"It's only been a few hours," Lilly said teasingly. Miley's smile grew wider.</p>
<p>"Still missed you," she said gently. "I always miss you when we're not together."</p>
<p>"Awww," Lilly gushed. "That's really sweet, Miles. Well, someday, we'll always be together… and then you'll never have to miss me."</p>
<p>"Promise?" Miley asked her girlfriend sweetly. Lilly grinned and leaned forward until their noses were just touching.</p>
<p>"Cross my heart," she whispered. Smiling again, Miley kissed her gently and squeezed her in another hug. They stayed that way for a few blissful minutes, until Miley's father finally reappeared, dressed and ready to go.</p>
<p>"If you two can stand to let each other go for a few minutes, we can go now," he told them in a joking tone. "Your brother and the others will meet us at the high school later."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't talk that way to your daughter and future daughter-in-law," Miley replied, sticking her tongue out. "You might hurt our feelings." Robbie Ray chuckled.</p>
<p>"I'll keep that in mind," he said with a smile. They all turned to leave, but at the last moment, Miley remembered something she'd left in her room, and she dashed back to get it, leaving her father and girlfriend alone together for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess I should take this opportunity to congratulate you, Lilly… and to say thank you," Robbie Ray said softly.</p>
<p>"Thank me?" Lilly replied, puzzled. "For what?"</p>
<p>"For making my little girl smile again," he said softly. Lilly blinked, stunned by the simple admission.</p>
<p>"Mr. S, I….I don't know what to say…"</p>
<p>"You don't have to say anything," Robbie Ray told her. "I just wanted you to know I can see how happy you make her… and I'll always be grateful." For a long moment, Lilly just stared at the man she had long thought of as her surrogate father. Then, impulsively, she walked over to him and hugged him gently.</p>
<p>"I said it before, and I'll say it again," Lilly said with a smile. "You're the best father Miley and Jackson could ever ask for… and it means a lot that you've been so supportive of Miley and me."</p>
<p>"That's what daddies are for," Robbie Ray said with a smile.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A few hours later, the familiar sounds of 'Pomp and Circumstance' began to fill the sports stadium at Pine Ridge High School as the graduation ceremony finally got underway. All of the students sat in simple folding chairs, lined up in long identical rows. A large stage had been set up in front of them, just in front of what would ordinarily be the visiting team's endzone, and here the principal stood, giving his commencement speech.</p>
<p>"As our graduates prepares to leave one life behind and start another, I want them to always remember the importance of staying true to themselves," Principal Wiggins' voice echoed through the stadium. "The strength within you, and the skills you have learned here, will prepare you for what is to come… but <i>how</i> you deal with it is something only you can decide. Choose well." The crowd of parents and other family members seated in the stands applauded, and the students politely did so as well.</p>
<p>"Now, Superintendent Marshall and I will present the diplomas," the principal continued. "While we, and the students, appreciate your enthusiastic support, we ask you to please keep your celebrating to a minimum so each student and their family can hear their names read aloud. Thank you."</p>
<p>One by one, each of the students stood up and walked up to the stage to receive their diploma and a hearty handshake from Principal Wiggins and Superintendent Marshall., and one by one their names were read aloud by a rotating group of teachers and other staff members.</p>
<p>When it was finally Miley's turn, she smiled nervously and carefully took the piece of paper offered to her.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Miss Stewart" the principal said to her, smiling warmly. "I know we'll be hearing great things from you."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Miley managed. She shook hands with the superintendent as well, then carefully made her way off the stage. She paused for a moment at the foot of the steps, her eyes immediately finding Lilly in the crowd of other students. Lilly grinned at her and winked, and Miley blew her a kiss. She just made it back to her seat by the time Lilly stepped on stage to receive her own diploma, and beamed with pride and happiness and she watched her best friend graduate.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone had their diplomas and returned to their seats. The principal said a few words, and the entire graduating class slid the tassels on top of their caps to the opposite side.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentleman, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you the graduating class of 2010!" Principal Wiggins called out proudly. The students gave a great roar and, as one, tossed their caps high into the air. With that, the stadium became a churning mass of excitement and celebration, as graduates were congratulated by each other and their proud families.</p>
<p>"We did it, Miles!" Lilly cried out excitedly, all but throwing herself into Miley's arms.</p>
<p>"We made it," Miley said happily. "Together."</p>
<p>"You sure did, bud," Robbie Ray agreed, walking up beside them. "I'm real proud of you; both of you." Miley grinned and hugged her father warmly.</p>
<p>"Thank you, daddy," she managed through her tears of joy. "I just wish momma could've been here."</p>
<p>"She is, bud," Robbie Ray replied softly. "She is."</p>
<p>"I bet she's looking down from Heaven and smiling right now," Heather Truscott added. "I know she's as proud of you and Lilly as we all are."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mrs. Truscott," Miley said with a smile. "That means a lot." More hugs and congratulations were shared, until Miley felt like she was ready to burst with happiness. Mamaw Ruthie and Aunt Dolly had also made it to the graduation, and were happy to give out plenty of hugs of their own.</p>
<p>"I'm really glad you could come, mamaw," Miley said earnestly. "You too, Aunt Dolly."</p>
<p>"We wouldn't have missed it for nothin', honey," Aunt Dolly said with a smile.</p>
<p>"After all, it's not every day my granddaughter graduates from high school," Mamaw added with a smile.</p>
<p>"It's not like they live all that far away, either," Jackson added.</p>
<p>"You don't have to help, you know," Miley said lightly. She was in far too good a mood to let her usually obnoxious older brother ruin it; particularly since she knew he was really only teasing.</p>
<p>"All right you two," their father gently reprimanded them. "What do you say we head back home and have us a good ol' celebration party?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me," Miley agreed happily. She turned towards her best friend, though their hands were already joined. "You ready to party, Lils?"</p>
<p>"Just lead me to it, Miles!" Lilly said excitedly. As the Stewart and Truscott families made their way out to the parking lot, Mamaw gently took Miley and Lilly aside.</p>
<p>"So have you and Lilly made any plans for after high school?" she asked them both.</p>
<p>"We've been talking about it," Miley admitted with a shy smile. She dropped her voice.</p>
<p>"I don't know what's gonna happen with the whole Hannah thing yet," Miley continued, keeping her voice low so they wouldn't be overheard, "but Lilly and I were talking about getting our own place together, and of course there's college."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you're both planning for the future," Ruthie said approvingly. "That's a very smart thing to do."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mamaw," Miley said with a smile.</p>
<p>"I don't know if you two moving in together is such a good idea, though," Ruthie continued. Miley's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"Don't give me that look, young lady," Ruthie reprimanded her gently.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Mamaw, it's just… well, you know Lilly and I love each other!" Miley exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Of course I do," Mamaw said with a gentle smile, "and I'm very happy for you both."</p>
<p>"Then… mamaw, I don't understand. Why don't you want Lilly and I to move in together?"</p>
<p>"Think of how it'll look to all your younger cousins, Miley Ray," Ruthie said, using Miley's middle name to emphasize the seriousness of the situation. "I know very well how you and Lilly feel about each other, and I have no doubt you'll be married someday soon, but until then, I think you need to set a good example for your younger cousins who look up to you."</p>
<p>"Well, it would probably just be at a college dorm for a while," Lilly said, trying to be helpful. "Miley and I couldn't afford anything else right now anyway." Ruthie looked over at Lilly and smiled warmly.</p>
<p>"I think that would be an acceptable solution," she said gently. "As long as school's involved, it'll raise fewer questions." She turned back to her granddaughter.</p>
<p>"That's a smart one you've got there, sweetheart; hang onto her," Ruthie said warmly. Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"I plan to, mamaw; I plan to."</p>
