
<p>Brooke allowed herself to be lowered onto the bed.  She was wearing
nothing but her underwear.  Josh was in a similar state of undress.
And from what Brooke could feel pressing against her thigh, she'd say
that his boxers were stretched to capacity.  Josh kissed Brooke's
neck and shoulders hungrily before moving up and capturing her lips.
His hand teased her nipple through the silk barrier of her bra.
Brooke placed her palms on Josh's chest and pushed him back slightly.</p>

<p>"Josh wait."</p>

<p>"Wha…?  I thought you wanted to?"  Josh was confused, but eager to
please.</p>

<p>"I do…but I thought that maybe we could try something different."</p>

<p>"Different huh?  Like what."  A number of scenarios were running
through Josh's imagination.  Doggy-style?  Sixty-nine?  Brooke on
top?  Dressing up like Batman and Robin?  This last one probably
wouldn't be Brooke's suggestion he reasoned…but he could hope.</p>

<p>Brooke didn't answer.  Instead her lips curled into a sexy smile as
she turned her head towards the door.  Josh did likewise and was more
than a little surprised to see Sam McPherson standing leaning against
the doorframe.  She was dressed in a midnight-blue silk night-shirt
that ended mid-thigh.  She had great legs, Josh observed critically.  </p>

<p>Brooke reached out an arm and beckoned to Sam with a finger. Sam
moved slowly towards the bed, shedding her shirt on the way.  She was
naked underneath.  Josh felt Brooke gasp beneath him and he could
understand why.   Sam's body was like a work of art.  Toned, firm,
supple, taught – all of these words and more wouldn't have done
justice to the young woman approaching the bed.</p>

<p>When Sam finally reached her destination she took Brooke's
outstretched hand in her own and kissed the back of it lightly.
Still holding the hand she climbed onto the bed beside the young
lovers.  Never removing her eyes from Brooke's, Sam pulled Josh to
her for a sensuous kiss.  When she released him Josh wasn't sure how
long he'd be able to control himself.  This was every boy's dream,
two hot girls all to himself.  While he tried to think of politicians
and gardening implements to calm his raging libido, Sam and Brooke
continued to regard each other.  It was as if they were somehow
communicating through their eyes.  Suddenly the communication became
oral when Brooke grabbed the back of Sam's neck, bringing their lips
together in a passionate kiss.  Sam wasted no time in removing
Brooke's bra and busying her hands with the very erect nipples that
lay underneath.  Brooke's fingers tangled in Sam's hair as the
brunette moved downwards, kissing a trail from Brooke's lips to her
breasts, feeling Brooke arch into her mouth upon her arrival.  </p>

<p>Josh knew he was going to come any second so he moved to enter
Brooke.  He was unsure of quite how he was going to go about it as
Brooke's body was almost completely covered by a whole lotta Sam.  He
attempted to gently nudge Sam over slightly so that he could gain
access to Brooke's nether regions.  He was rewarded for his troubles
by a not so gentle shove from a disgruntled blonde who was enjoying
Sam's ministrations far too much to have her disturbed in any way. </p>

<p>Taken aback, Josh considered his options.  Brooke's mouth was free,
well, apart from moaning Sam's name every so often.  Josh quickly
shrugged his boxer shorts off and moved into a kneeling position.
Brooke, feeling the movement on the bed turned to look at him.  His
intentions were as clear as the nose on his face, and a few other
apparent appendages.  Brooke graced him with a "You've got to be
kidding" expression before urging Sam back up her body so she could
reclaim her lips.  They kissed intensely for a moment.  Sam turned to
face Josh while Brooke continued to kiss her jaw and neck.</p>

<p>"Are you still here?  Haven't you got the message yet?"  Sam asked,
her voice dripped with scorn.  "I can take it from here.  Or in fact,
maybe you should stick around and watch, you might learn about a
little thing called foreplay."  Sam turned her attention back to
Brooke.</p>

<p>Josh sat for a moment, stunned.  His excitement had shrivelled,
killed by the vitriol in Sam's voice and the disdain in her eyes.
The girls continued to make out.  And by the looks of things it
wasn't the first time.  They seemed to be very familiar with each
other's bodies and reactions.  When Sam's hand began a journey down
Brooke's side, over her stomach and came to rest on her panties Josh
decided it was time for him to leave.  He gathered up his clothes
dejectedly and headed for the door.  He turned one last time to see
Brooke arch her whole body into Sam, trying to become part of her it
seemed.  They were locked in each other's gazes again, not blinking.
Josh turned and left.</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke moved together like a single entity.  Brooke knew she
was close but she didn't want the feeling to end.  She pulled Sam to
her so they were nose to nose, needing to feel the other girl's sweat
and hot breath on her skin.</p>

<p>"Brooke." Sam whispered.</p>

<p>"What baby?"  </p>

<p>"Brooke."  Louder this time, more insistent.</p>

<p>"What is it Sammy?"  Brooke was confused.</p>

<p>"Brooke."  Sam's voice had changed, it was no longer her own.</p>

<p>"Sam?" </p>

<p>"Brooke, come on, breakfast's nearly ready" Jane shouted, knocking on
her bedroom door.  </p>

<p>Brooke awoke, breathless and sweaty.  She covered her face with her
hands, trying to get her heart rate back to normal.</p>

<p>"I'm coming!" she called, smiling at the irony of the statement.  She
thought back to the dream.  It was the third time she'd had it since
she and Josh had broken up.  It was always the same.  It started with
her and Josh in bed, then Sam would join them and Brooke would lose
all interest in Josh.  What did it mean?  </p>

<p>With a sigh Brooke dragged herself out of bed and to the bathroom.
When she entered she was startled to see Sam looking at her, a highly
amused expression on her face and a toothbrush hanging out of her
mouth.  Brooke quickly glanced down at herself, hoping that her
pyjama buttons were all done up.  Satisfied she wasn't flashing
anyone, she looked back at Sam who was still smiling mysteriously at
her.  </p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked, annoyed both by the unwanted scrutiny first
thing in the morning and by the fact that Sam looked so damn cute
looking at her that way.</p>

<p>"Good dream this morning?"  Sam asked, her grin widening.</p>

<p>Brooke almost swallowed her tongue in shock.  How could she
know?  "Dream?  What dream?  I wasn't dreaming anything!"  Her voice
was much squeakier than she had intended, this only added to Sam's
enjoyment.  </p>

<p>"Hmmm, then all the moaning and panting I heard on the way past your
room was just my imagination huh?"  Sam was assured that it was most
definitely not her imagination by the interesting shade of red that
Brooke had turned.  She decided to let her off lightly, after all
everybody has sex dreams right?</p>

<p>"Whatever Brooke, but just between you and me, if Josh is half as
good in bed as his dream-counterpart sounds, I'd have kept hold of
him." </p>

<p> Sam breezed out of the bathroom leaving Brooke both relieved and
confused.  Relieved by the fact that she hadn't called out Sam's name
in her sleep, thereby dropping herself completely in it.  And
confused, because Sam's words had had an effect on her.  If Sam was
half as good as kisser…and other stuff…as she was in Brooke's dreams,
then Brooke would happily surrender herself to Sam's lips and hands
for the rest of her life.  But that wasn't an option.  She didn't
even want it to be an option.  Not Sam.  Not her.  Anybody but her.
But then an image of Sam would creep into her mind and chase away all
those negative thoughts.  Confusion didn't even begin to cover it.
Brooke resolved to subtly enquire at school as to the meaning of sex
dreams and the likelihood of them ever becoming reality.  Now if she
could only figure out a way to tell Nicole about the dream without
using the words Sam or Josh she'd be fine.  </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Mary Cherry, I do believe you're right.  This is the exact shade of
lip-gloss that Gwyneth wore in Bounce."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry grinned maniacally and clapped her hands together.  "Ah
knew it!  And may ah just say that it looks stunnin' on you, if Ben
Aff-leck was to walk in here raht now he'd fall to the floor and kiss
your Gucci clad feet!"</p>

<p>"And who could blame him?"  Nicole re-capped the lip-gloss, satisfied
that she'd achieved perfection.  She pouted and smiled and examined
her lips from different angles in the mirror.  While doing so she was
distracted by the sight of Brooke gnawing on a fingernail.  "Now,
Brookie, honey, stop that.  We don't want ragged old housewife hands
for the big game next week."</p>

<p>Brooke took her hand away from her mouth and started pacing back and
forward.  Nicole looked at Mary Cherry and raised an eyebrow, Mary
Cherry did the same, even though she hadn't the slightest idea what
Nicole was getting at.</p>

<p>"B, is something the matter?"  Nicole thought she'd better play the
concerned friend role.  It wouldn't do for the co-captain to have a
nervous breakdown in the middle of her sophomore year.  Brooke took a
deep breath.  Then she let it out again.  She slumped down on one of
the plush, pink sofas the Novak had to offer.  Looking down at her
hands she finally spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you guys…ever have…dreams?"</p>

<p>"Dreams as in the Malcolm X kind or the regular, in bed kind?"</p>

<p>"In bed, actually, in bed in bed."</p>

<p>"Huh?  You've lost me now hun."  Nicole waited for clarification.
Something was obviously worrying Brooke, and despite the hard-hearted
bitch act, if there was one thing Nicole gave a damn about, it was
Brooke.  Brooke was now wringing her hands together, still looking
down.</p>

<p>"I mean, sex dreams."  This was said in barely a whisper but Nicole
and Mary Cherry's Scandal Radar picked out the words with no
difficulty whatsoever.</p>

<p>"Sex dreams!  Why my Lordy! Brookie, have you been dreamin' about
some handsome stud thrustin' his throbbin' love stick into your
garden of paradise?"  Mary Cherry was an avid fan of pulp romance
novels and bad soap operas. "Now, if you could just furnish me with
the details of these sordid little naght-tahm adventures of yours,
ahm sure ah could ask the Lord Jesus to forgive your sins."  Mary
Cherry had produced a notebook and pen from somewhere and was poised
to use them.  Nicole and Brooke chose to ignore this.</p>

<p>"Come on Brookie, everybody dreams about sex.  It's totally normal.
You're not telling me this is the first time you've gotten all hot
and sweaty during the night?"  </p>

<p>Nicole offered what she thought was a reassuring smile.  The effect
it had on Brooke was not quite the desired one.  She covered her face
with her hands and moaned. "Oh God." Over and over.  Brooke was
remembering exactly how hot and sweaty she had been.  And who the
cause of it was. Upon seeing this Nicole realised that Brooke's dream
must have been more than a run of the mill encounter.  Eager to hear
more she leaned in close to Brooke, so did Mary Cherry – pen still at
the ready.</p>

<p>"You can tell us B, what was it?  S&M?  Dom/Sub?  Role-playing?"</p>

<p>"Usin' strap on appendages to commit unspeakable acts of depravity?"
Mary Cherry got a far away look in her eyes when she said this which
disturbed Brooke and Nicole profoundly.</p>

<p>"No, no, it wasn't anything like that…it was…kind of a threesome
thing."  Brooke said, blushing to the roots of her perfectly styled
hair.</p>

<p>"Well, that's hardly X-rated is it?" said Nicole, a little
disappointed at the revelation.  Something occurred to her.  "What
was the mix?  You and two guys?  You, a guy and a girl?  You and two
girls?"</p>

<p>Brooke blushed even deeper.  "Well, it was me and a guy…to start with…
then a girl joined us…then the guy left…well actually…we sort of made
him leave."</p>

<p>Nicole's eyebrows went up.  This she hadn't expected.  Little Miss
Perfect was having erotic lesbian dreams.  Had this been anyone else
she would have had a field day with the gossip potential, but there
were more pressing matters on her mind.</p>

<p>"OK, let's get things clear here.  You were with a guy, a girl came
in, and you chose her over him?"</p>

<p>Brooke looked up at Nicole through her lashes and nodded.</p>

<p>"And did you like having sex with this girl?"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah!"  The practically growled exclamation had escaped before
Brooke had a chance to think about her reply.  Nicole's eyebrows
reached new heights as Brooke slapped a hand over her mouth.  Mary
Cherry was watching the conversation unfold like a tennis-fan.  Head
following the action back and forth, eyes lighting up whenever
something particularly interesting was said.  Nicole processed
Brooke's answer for a minute before replying.</p>

<p>"Ummm, Brookie, you know that lesbian chic is so out that even Anne
Heche has given up on it right?  I mean, not that you'd ever do
anything about this dream right?  It's not like you want to, right?"
Nicole's voice was tending towards the desperate side.  Not allowing
Brooke to reply to this Nicole continued.  "OK, I think we should
stop talking about this now, it's not like it's going to be an issue,
it's just a one off dream.  I knew you shouldn't have watched Cruel
Intentions fourteen times."  Nicole appeared to be talking to herself
as much as Brooke.</p>

<p>"Actually, I've had the dream three times now."  Brooke was finding
it easier to talk about this stuff as the conversation progressed.</p>

<p>"Three tahms?  Mah word Brooke, you're almost eligible for your free
KD Lang concert tickets!"  Mary Cherry put in gleefully.  Nicole did
not look gleeful, she looked decidedly ungleeful.</p>

<p>"So now it's a recurring dream?  Well this is great, if this gets out
we're all finished.  Can't you just see the headlines now?  `Lesbian
Orgies at Cheerleading Practice'  `Forget the Glamazons, meet the
Sapphites!'  And those are the nice ones, those would be printed if
it wasn't Spam McSmearson writing the article.  Can you imagine what
would be written if bitchface ever…" Nicole trailed off, noting how
Brooke's gaze had dropped the minute Sam's name was mentioned.  She
slowly approached Brooke and stooped so she was on eye level with
her.  "Actually B, you never did tell us who the other players in
your little performance were.  Are they famous?  Do we know them?
Pray tell."  </p>

<p>Mary Cherry watched this interesting turn of events with delight…this
was better than Days Of Our Lives!  Brooke sighed and decided that
she may as well go all the way now that she'd started.  She looked up
and squared off with Nicole.</p>

<p>"They guy was Josh…and the girl…was…Sam."  There, she'd said it.  And
now she waited for the fallout.  Nicole appeared to have frozen in
place.  She hadn't moved so much as an eyelash after Brooke's
admission.  Mary Cherry, on the other hand, who was totally
unprepared for this little revelation had started flapping a hand in
front of her face.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, ah've got the vapours.  Brookie and the bitch troll from
hell? Why ah just can't…" And with that she promptly fainted.  This
seemed to kick-start Nicole again.  She stood up and walked away from
Brooke.  Then she spun around to face her once more.</p>

<p>"Spam?  You couldn't have picked someone else?  Anyone else?"</p>

<p>"I didn't pick her…she just sort of appeared."  Brooke explained
lamely.  "And it's not like I'm dating her, I just had a dream about
her."</p>

<p>"Which you enjoyed immensely by the sounds of it.  Repeatedly.  And
it won't be long before the dreams aren't enough, before you have to
get a bigger buzz, before you move on to the real thing.  And when
that happens we're all ruined."  Nicole tried to rationalise the
situation.  "Is it because of the tongue thing?"  </p>

<p>"What tongue thing?" Brooke asked, dreading the answer.</p>

<p>"You know, you must have noticed.  Spam is constantly playing around
with her tongue.  If it's not stuck in her cheek she's licking her
teeth or her lips with it.  She brandishes that thing around like a
deadly weapon.  Maybe subconsciously you've thought that she'd be
really talented with it and that's triggered these nightmares."
Nicole looked at Brooke expectantly after offering her hypothesis.
Brooke was horrified.  Not only that Nicole had been thinking about
Sam's tongue, in detail it seemed, but that this discussion was
bringing back memories of exactly how skilled Sam was with her tongue.</p>

<p>"Nicole!  I can't believe you asked me that.  I…I'm not even going to
reply to that."  She looked down at her shoes again.  "And they
weren't nightmares." She added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"See, it's saying things like that that's got me worried!"  Nicole
fumed.  "What if you'd…" </p>

<p> The opening of the Novak door shut her up.  And lo and behold, who
should walk in to the middle of the war-zone but Sam.  She was used
to the blondes turning silent when she entered a room.  She figured
it had something to do with the damning editorials she'd written in
the past about them.  She wasn't quite so used to the smile she was
getting from Brooke though.  Sure they had been getting along lately,
but this was a bit much.  It disturbed her even more than the
murderous glare Nicole was throwing her way.</p>

<p>"Hey Sam!" Brooke said, a little too brightly.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam began hesitantly.  "I…uh…why is Mary Cherry on the floor?"</p>

<p>Nicole and Brooke both turned to see the southerner spread-eagled on
the shag pile carpeting.  They had forgotten about her.  Brooke
turned back to face Sam, the smile still in place.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's fine, she just fainted."</p>

<p>"Right…well, I have to…uh…use the bathroom now, so…"</p>

<p>"That's great Spam, we're thrilled to hear that."  Nicole grabbed
Brooke and dragged her to her feet.  "Come on Brookie, I think we
should go somewhere quiet and discuss aversion therapy."  </p>

<p>And holding Brooke firmly by the elbow, Nicole marched them both out
of the Novak.  Sam was confused by this behaviour but didn't give it
a great deal of thought as Mary Cherry had come round and was staring
at her with something resembling a mixture between hatred and arousal.</p>

<p>"Well thank you Samantha, if you coulda kept your dirty whore hands
to yourself , me and mah cheerleadin' compatriots  wouldn't have to
be shamed in this very degradin' Showgirls manner."  </p>

<p>She burst into tears, turning her mascara into a black river delta
beneath each eye almost immediately.  She then grabbed her bag and
ran out of the Novak.  Sam stood in wonder.  She had no idea what
Mary Cherry was referring to, but that coupled with the strange vibes
from Brooke and Nicole earlier on had her worried.  Maybe she should
talk to Principal Hall about random drug testing among the
cheerleaders.  </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Lily sat playing with her tofu.  Carmen was talking to her but she
had tuned out after the word `cheerleader' was mentioned.  Lily liked
to think of herself as a compassionate person.  She loved all living
creatures and would stick up for almost any cause.  So she had
listened to Carmen's "I want to be a cheerleader" speech with
interest and sympathy…the first 5 or so times.  After that, when she
sensed the rant coming on Lily had started to retreat into her own
little world, `hmmming' and nodding at all the right places but not
really listening.  After all, it was hard to get worked up about
airhead girls in short skirts jumping up and down and spelling things
with their arms when people in the world were starving and animals
were being mistreated.  But because Carmen was her friend she didn't
come right out and say this, even when she started the `Nicole Julian
is such a bitch' segment yet again.</p>

<p>Lily's wandering attention was caught when Mary Cherry entered the
lunchroom looking like the newest Panda exhibit at the San Diego
zoo.  Her being seen in public like that either meant that something
very interesting had happened or that Gwyneth had decided to give up
making movies and become a missionary.  Carmen had also noticed the
black eyed southerner's entrance and had mercifully shut up in order
to eavesdrop more easily on whatever she was going to say.  Mary
Cherry spotted Josh and Sugar Daddy sitting discussing some sport or
other at the table next to Lily and Carmen.  She made a beeline for
them, sending several geeks sprawling to the floor in her hurry.
Upon her arrival Josh and SD took in her tear-stained appearance and
braced themselves for whatever fashion disaster had befallen her that
morning.</p>

<p>"Josh, I wanted to be the first to condole you on your cruel and
humiliatin' rejection."  She placed a comforting hand on his shoulder
and dropped her head to her chest in sympathy.</p>

<p>"Uh, that's really nice Mary Cherry…but Brooke dumped me over a week
ago."  Josh looked at SD and rolled his eyes.  Mary Cherry's head
snapped to attention, eyes sparkling with delight as she realised she
would be the one to pass on the news of Brooke's adventures in
dreamland.  She pulled out the seat next to Josh and sat down,
reaching out to take his hand in hers.</p>

<p>"Y'all mean you haven't heard?  Why ah jus' thought that Brookie
maght have had the decency to tell you before she went an' spread it
around."  </p>

<p>She shook her head in mock disbelief.  Josh was feeling slightly
uncomfortable and very apprehensive.  He didn't want to know what
Mary Cherry had to say but he knew that he had to hear it now or the
curiosity would eat away at him.</p>

<p>"What did you think Brooke should have told me?"  He tried to remain
calm.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not really mah place to say…but since you asked so nicely
an' all…"  Mary Cherry assumed her best serious expression before
continuing.  "Josh, prepare yourself, this may come as quite a shock
to you…ah know ah was shocked and ah've seen Basic Instinct: the
uncut version!"</p>

<p>"Just…" Josh began, agitated.  He collected himself before going
on. "Just tell me what happened."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that Ms McQueen has been havin' dirty dreams about
someone other than your good self…no, that's not true, you were in
them too until you were forcibly asked to leave Brooke and her new
lover to get on with it!"  Mary Cherry shook her head, still trying
to comprehend how Brooke could have chosen Sam over Josh.  Josh had
such a great ass.</p>

<p>Josh was somewhat relieved at the climax of the tale.  He had thought
that Brooke was seeing someone else.  OK, so it hurt that she was
dreaming about sleeping with someone else…and it was very painful
that he'd been ejected from her dream bed in favour of this new
Casanova, but it was only a dream after all.  He realised that Mary
Cherry was still talking.</p>

<p>"Ah mean, ah jus' do not understand why Brookie would want to lower
her standards that far" she said with a pointed look at
that `unpopular' table.  Carmen caught the look and its meaning.  She
tried to convey this to Lily who couldn't quite follow all the
widened eyes and head tilts so Carmen was forced to whisper to her.</p>

<p>"Ohmygod!  Brooke's been dreaming about Harrison."   </p>

<p>Lily mouthed `Harrison?'  Carmen nodded.  `No way!' Carmen nodded
again, Lily could be so dense sometimes.</p>

<p>"Wait till we tell Sam that Brooke is crushing on her best friend.
That should make for some interesting fireworks." Carmen said, under
her breath.</p>

<p>Josh was really trying to avoid asking the next question but it was
forcing its way out of his mouth.  "So," he tried to be casual. "Who
was she dreaming about?"</p>

<p>Mary Cherry grinned, this was her big moment, and she wanted the
delivery to be just right.  "Ah am truly sorry to be the one to tell
you this…but your golden girl girlfriend has joined the ranks of the
inhabitants of Lesbania…she wuz dreamin' about…Sam McPherson!"</p>

<p>Josh stared at Mary Cherry like she had horns growing out of her
head.  She sensed that he was having a little trouble believing her.
She nodded vigorously.  "It's true Josh, and apparently Ms McPherson
is quite a tiger between the sheets."  Josh continued to stare
blankly.</p>

<p>At the next table Carmen was banging Lily on the back, attempting to
dislodge the rather large piece of apple that had stuck in her throat
when Mary Cherry had revealed that Sam, not Harrison, had been the
star of Brooke's wet dream.  Learning that their friend was more than
proficient in bed caused the apple to pop back up and Lily managed to
inhale some oxygen before her brain completely died.  Carmen and Lily
stared at each other in disbelief.  Brooke was dreaming about having
sex with Sam.  This was almost too good.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Lily and Carmen made their way to biology class, anxious to speak to
Sam.  When they arrived they saw her engaged in a heated debate with
Harrison over the best kind of lighting to use in a documentary piece
they were shooting together.  They hurried over to Sam's table,
coming to a halt directly in front of her.  Sam looked at them,
mildly amused by the expressions they wore; the ones that usually
meant they had juicy gossip to share.</p>

<p>"Hey guys, what's up?" Sam asked, grinning conspiratorially.</p>

<p>"You will never believe what we just heard in the lunchroom." Carmen
began excitedly.  She was interrupted by Ms Glass.</p>

<p>"Ms Esposito, I don't believe that you sit next to Ms Ferrera.  Or
have you heard that there are some woodworm in that particular desk
that need saving?"  </p>

<p>Lily raised her eyes to the heavens and gave Carmen a look that
said `Don't you dare tell her without me being here.'  Carmen nodded,
without the slightest intention of waiting so that they could tell
her together.</p>

<p>"So…?"  Sam prompted.</p>

<p>"Like I said, this is unbelievable, but it's totally true, we got it
straight from the horse's mouth…or as near as you can get to the
horse's mouth without getting bitten…"</p>

<p>"Carm come on, I'm dying here!"  </p>

<p>"Right, right, sorry.  OK, we were in the caf…I…uh…I'll tell you
later."  Carmen turned around so that she was facing the front.  Sam
turned to the back of the class to see what had caused the sudden
change of heart.  Brooke had entered with Nicole and was having what
looked like a hushed argument.</p>

<p>"Nicole, I really don't think that slapping my face every time I look
at her is going to do any good."</p>

<p>"OK…how about I slap her in the face?  Or punch her?  Would a couple
of black eyes turn you off do you think?" Nicole asked hopefully.  </p>

<p>"There will be no violence of any sort, OK?  Now just drop it."  They
had reached their seats.  Brooke greeted Sam with a smile as she sat
down.  Sam returned the smile and noticed that Nicole was looking
pure ice at her.  She couldn't quite figure it out.  Obviously
something was going on.  Mary Cherry's strange outburst earlier in
the day was one thing.  But now Nicole was being even more outwardly
vicious towards her than usual.  Brooke seemed to be the odd one
out.  Sam wondered if Carmen's gossip had anything to do with the
whole thing.</p>

<p>Brooke, meanwhile, found herself looking at Sam, appraising her
almost.  There were no two ways about it, Sam was drop dead
gorgeous.  But she was much more than that.  She exuded a sensuality
that didn't come with designer clothes and immaculate make-up.  She
was just naturally sexy and Brooke wondered why she had never noticed
this before.  And why she was noticing it now.  As she continued to
watch Sam scribbling on her notebook Brooke was alarmed to see that
her tongue was planted firmly in her cheek.  It was even more
alarming when she ran that same tongue along her top teeth and then
proceeded to lick her lips thoroughly.  Brooke found herself
imagining what that tongue would feel like running along her own
lips.  Nicole had been right, Sam did seem to want to show off how
flexible her tongue was…and its effect on Brooke was almost
palpable.  She quickly averted her eyes to avoid complete meltdown.</p>

<p>What Brooke hadn't been aware of was that a number of sets of eyes
had been watching her watching Sam.  Carmen kept sneaking furtive
glances over her shoulder.  Mary Cherry and Lily were both fixated on
the little Sam-worshipping session that was taking place on the other
side of the classroom.  Nicole was silently plotting Sam's untimely
demise.  A phone call with a hot journalism tip off would lead Sam to
somewhere deserted for a secret meeting with a contact.  However,
when she got there she'd find nothing but a ticking bomb.  The last
thing she'd hear would be the turning of a key in a lock.  Nicole
smiled at this comforting thought, whispering `Thank you' to an
unseen audience.  Harrison heard the quiet expression of gratitude
and surmised that Nicole was even more insane than people already
thought.  He too had noticed Brooke watching Sam.  However, he did
not deduce anything from it, it merely added to the fantasy
collection of visuals he kept in his head.  In the past he had
wondered how healthy it was for him to be imagining two women
touching each other when his mother was indulging in that very act
through the wall.  But he soon dismissed this thought and continued
with his indulgence.</p>

<p>"Ford?  Ford?  Where is Josh Ford?"  Ms Glass was in the middle of
roll call.  Mary Cherry raised her hand and waved it madly.</p>

<p>"Yes Cherry?"</p>

<p>"Ms Glass, sir, ah don't think that Josh will be makin' it to class
this afternoon.  Ah had to give him some very distressin' news at
lunch and he didn't take it too well."  Mary Cherry smiled sweetly.
Brooke spun around in her seat to see Nicole sending daggers in the
direction of Mary Cherry, who was blissfully ignorant of this fact.  </p>

<p>"Whatever." Ms Glass was about to move on with the register when she
noticed Mary Cherry's hand shooting up in the air again.  Ms Glass
sighed.</p>

<p>"Yes Cherry?"</p>

<p>"Ah have a biological question ah'd lahk to ask you Ms Glass, sir, if
ah may."  Receiving a weary nod from the teacher Mary Cherry
continued, still unaware of Brooke's expression of utter panic and
Nicole's one which carried the threat of impending bodily
violence. "Mah question is of the sexual kind, what does it mean when
a normal, healthy, well brought-up young gal starts having dreams
about indulgin' in some mattress dancin' with someone of the female
type, that is to say, the same gender as herself?"</p>

<p>Ms Glass didn't look fazed in the slightest by the question which was
more than could be said for the majority of the class.  Sam looked
around her at the bizarre reactions the question had prompted in a
number of her contemporaries.  Brooke looked especially affected.
Sam didn't think that anyone could turn that red without some kind of
internal bleeding occurring.</p>

<p>"Well Cherry, it's totally normal for teenagers to have dreams of a
sexual nature involving a number of different people, sometimes this
can involve people of the same sex.  It's a natural way to explore
sexuality without risk of disease or pregnancy."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry brightened.  "So, it doesn't mean that she's a ravin'
dyke?"</p>

<p>"No, wish fulfilment isn't always an ingredient in the dream state.
Although, if the dream is recurring it can often mean that there is
some underlying feeling there."  Ms Glass stopped close by Mary
Cherry's desk.  She continued in a low voice. "If you're concerned
about your dreams Cherry you can always come to me after class."  And
with a wink she turned around and clapped her hands.  "OK brats,
today we're talking about the nitrogen cycle."</p>

<p>Sam leaned over and tapped Brooke lightly on the arm, causing the
other girl to jump violently.</p>

<p>"Sorry, I was just going to ask if you were OK?  You don't look very
well."</p>

<p>"I…uh…no I'm not feeling all that great."  It wasn't a lie, she felt
sick to her stomach.  "Uh, Sam, do you have your car with you
today?"  Sam nodded.  "Do you think you could give me a lift home
after class?  I really can't face talking to anybody right now."</p>

<p>"Sure Brooke, no problem."  Sam was concerned.  It was very unlike
Brooke to want to avoid people.  And it meant she'd have to wait for
a while longer before she heard what Carmen had to say to her.  Oh
well, she'd hear soon enough if it was a big enough deal.  She turned
her attention to the nitrogen cycle. </p>

<p>Brooke laid her head down on the desk.  What was she going to do
now?  Josh knew.  God only knew who else had found out.  Mary Cherry
had planted a seed of curiosity in the whole damn class.  There was
no way she was getting out of this one unscathed.  She turned her
head to the side to steal a glance at Sam.  She looked so cute when
she was being attentive.  `Oh God Brooke, get a grip,' she thought to
herself.  She sighed deeply.  If she could just ensure that Sam
didn't find out things might still be OK.  She hoped.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke sat on her bed with her knees pulled up to her chest.  She
hugged them as she thought about everything that had happened during
the day.  Just as she was beginning to get really depressed she was
distracted by the sight of Sam in a very short, black silk night-
dress.  It was then Brooke realised she was naked.  Sam walked
towards her and reached out, taking Brooke's hands into her own and
pulling her into a standing position.  They stood in silence, mere
inches between their bodies, staring deeply into each other's eyes.
Brooke broke the intense eye contact to look over Sam's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Isn't Josh here?" she asked.  Sam put her hands on Brooke's hips,
urging her forward to close the tiny space that had existed between
them so that their bodies were touching.  Sam's lip curled in a
sultry smile.</p>

<p>"Do you still think you want Josh to be here?"  She moved so that her
lips were within millimetres of Brooke's, when she spoke her warm
breath sent shock waves through Brooke's body.  "Aren't I enough for
you?"  Brooke nodded her head but didn't dare speak the words out
loud.  Sam pulled back slightly to look into Brooke's eyes once
more.  "Why don't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Tell you what?"</p>

<p>"How you feel about me."</p>

<p>"I…I couldn't…you don't…you wouldn't want…" Sam cut her off by
placing a gentle finger on her lips.  She traced Brooke's jawbone
with her thumb before speaking.</p>

<p>"Don't ever assume that you know how I feel or how I'll react without
giving me a chance."  Sam placed a soft kiss on the end of Brooke's
nose.  "Tell me."  She brought her arms up around Brooke's naked
torso, pulling her into the warmth of her embrace.  Brooke laid her
head on Sam's shoulder, feeling safe and secure for the first time
since…well, perhaps for the first time ever.  She hugged Sam to her,
terrified to let her go in case she never got the chance
again.  "Tell me Brooke."</p>

<p>Brooke took a deep breath and stood up straight.  She looked into
Sam's eyes and saw nothing but trust and acceptance.  Acceptance is
what Brooke had striven for her whole life.  She had achieved it at
school, but somehow that didn't seem to fulfil her.  Sam's
acceptance, on the other hand, filled her up with contentment until
she thought she might explode from the feeling.  She started to
speak.  And after the initial hesitance the words seemed to flow out
of her like a river bursting its dam.</p>

<p>"Sam, I don't really know how this started, or when it started,
although I have a feeling that it's been there longer than I'd care
to admit.  I…feel…something for you, something I've never felt
before.  And it scares me to death.  I mean, I never thought I'd fall
for a girl…and especially not you, no offence.  But I've fallen hard
and I don't really want to get up.  In fact I think I'd be quite
happy if you lay down beside me.  I'm really not sure what it is I'm
feeling, I know that I'm attracted to you, but I think it's much
deeper than that…I think…and I don't want to scare you off or
anything…but I think I'm falling in love with you."  </p>

<p>Brooke stopped, needing to take a breath.  She looked at Sam for the
first time since she'd started her little speech.  To her surprise
there were tears in Sam's eyes.  As the first tear started to make
its way down her cheek Brooke reached out and brushed it away.</p>

<p>"Why are you crying?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Brooke, there is no way that anyone could react badly to what you
just told me.  It was beautiful and it was from the heart.  I think
you know me a bit better than you think you do, and you know there's
no way that I'd hurt anyone who said those things.  Give me a chance
Brooke, please."</p>

<p>"But…but I just told you."</p>

<p>"I think you know what I mean."  Sam leaned in and kissed Brooke
tenderly, savouring the sweetness of her lips.  Brooke returned the
kiss, trying to show Sam the depths of her feelings that words simply
could not convey.  Their lips parted but they remained close, holding
each other, foreheads touching.  Sam was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Sooooo, now that you have me all to yourself with no Josh to get in
the way, what are you going to do with me?"  Her lips were upturned
in a devilish smile.  Brooke didn't reply.  Instead she stepped back,
out of Sam's arms and looked at her. </p>

<p>"Well, for what I've got in mind, you are way overdressed.  How about
we do something about that?"</p>

<p>Sam grinned and reached down to pull the night-dress over her head.
Once free of her silk confines Sam was happy to let Brooke explore
her body with her eyes, followed by her hands, and finally her lips.
Brooke marvelled at the smooth skin.  So much paler than her own,
with a few tiny freckles in some very interesting places.  Letting
her tongue trail between Sam's breasts she brought her hands up to
cup them.  Sam's moan thrilled Brooke beyond belief and she was
compelled to go back up and kiss the lips it had escaped from.  She
felt Sam's hands slide up her back, one arms curled around her
tightly while the other hand tangled itself in her hair, deepening
the contact and the kiss.  They broke apart and looked feverishly
into each other's eyes, desire and need apparent in both sets.  </p>

<p>But for some reason Sam started to move away.  Brooke reached out to
stop her, to continue what they had started, but Sam managed to evade
her grasp.  She walked backwards towards the door, never looking
anywhere but Brooke's eyes.  Brooke was distraught.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?  You can't leave me.  Please…please come back."</p>

<p>Sam smiled but didn't stop.  "Tell me."  And then she was gone.
Brooke looked around her as her surroundings started to turn white.
She was aware of a noise, a knocking sound.  It was all around her
but she couldn't tell where it was coming from.  She covered her ears
and squeezed her eyes shut.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>When her eyes opened again she was lying on her bed where she'd lain
after Sam had brought her home.  Realising she'd dozed off and had
been dreaming Brooke resisted the urge to scream with frustration.
Then the knocking sound started again.  But this time it was
obviously coming from the door.</p>

<p>"Brooke?  Are you awake?"  Sam's voice drifted in from the hallway.  </p>

<p>Brooke bit her lip.  Oh God, here was her chance.  She could tell Sam
about the dreams.  Or not.  But then she heard Dream-Sam speaking to
her `Tell me'.  Inhaling deeply Brooke sat up and adjusted her
clothing.  OK, it was now or never.</p>

<p>"Yeah Sam, come on in."</p>

<p>The door opened and Sam's head peeked round.  "Did I wake you?"</p>

<p>"No, I was just kind of napping, it's fine." </p>

<p>Sam came all the way in and closed the door behind her.  Brooke noted
that Sam hadn't looked her directly in the face since she came in.
She came to the bed and sat down on the very edge of it.  She started
playing with the duvet cover.  She seemed nervous.  Compassion
bubbled to the surface in Brooke as she was compelled to find out why
Sam looked so apprehensive.</p>

<p>"Are…are you OK?  I mean, did you want to talk to me about
something?" she asked.  </p>

<p>Sam finally looked up.  Her face was unreadable.</p>

<p>"I…uh…I just got off the phone with Carmen.  She…told me something
she heard at school today.   I think we should talk, don't you?</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I can't believe you told her over the phone!  I would have loved to
have seen her face…so how'd she take it?"  Lily asked excitedly, then
remembered that this was their friend and not some person on the
Jerry Springer Show.  She tried to compose herself.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," Carmen replied, slowly.  "She just kind of
went `Oh'.  And then she was silent for the longest time.  I thought
she'd fainted but then she said she had to go and hung up." </p>

<p>"Wow…I thought Sam of all people would have more of a reaction than
that.  So she wasn't grossed out or anything?"</p>

<p>"Lily, she's not twelve for God's sake.  Like I said, she didn't say
anything…I don't know how to take that really."</p>

<p>"What if hearing the news has caused a psychotic episode and she's
over there murdering Brooke as we speak and afterwards will have no
recollection of the terrible events and…"</p>

<p>"Lily!  Shut up!  She's not murdering Brooke…you don't really think…
nah…she wouldn't…"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, hearing that your arch nemesis and unwanted
housemate has the hots for you might do something to a person's
psyche."</p>

<p>"Do…do you think we should go over there?  Just to make sure
everyone's alive and nobody's had a breakdown or anything?"  Carmen
looked at Lily and they both nodded.  "Let's go."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>While Sam's friends were inventing wild Lizzy Borden fantasies, two
blondes were having a heated discussion via cell-phone.</p>

<p>"You'll just have to wait until Brooke decides your fate, but if I
was her I'd have you wear a moo-moo and have your head shaved to show
your penance."</p>

<p>"But Nic, ah was jus' tryin' to help poor Brookie in her tahm of
need.  Mah question proved that she doesn't need to join the Melissa
Etheridge fan club just yet…this is probably just a phase…a very
strange and disturbin' phase…" she trailed off, hoping this had
pacified Nicole somewhat.

"Well…it pains me to agree with you after your outburst in bio, but I
do hope Brookie's bizarre infatuation with Miss Journohag is some
kind of temporary insanity.  I don't think I could handle having to
look at her smug little face every day at lunch."  Nicole shuddered
at the thought.</p>

<p>"Ah totally agree with you, Nic." Mary Cherry sensed that Nicole was
close to forgiving her.  "But…what if it isn't?"  </p>

<p>Nicole sighed.  This possibility had also occurred to her.  After
all, it must have been praying heavily on Brooke's mind for her to
bring it up.  Nicole was terrified that those underlying feelings Ms
Glass had been talking about were present in this case.  Something
that had been lying dormant at the back of Nicole's mind suddenly
awoke.</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, did you notice that B suddenly became a Buffy fan in
the third season?"</p>

<p>"Ah…ummm…well Nic ah don't think ah was around back then."  Mary
Cherry had no idea what Nicole was getting at.</p>

<p>"Yes, she never started watching it until that slutty other slayer
came into it.  The slayer with long brown hair, full pouty lips and
big brown eyes…" Nicole was panic stricken. "Oh God, this has been
going on much longer than we thought…she's obviously got a thing for
a certain type of girl and Spam McBitch fits the profile."  Nicole
felt herself start to hyperventilate and quickly reasserted her
unflappable exterior.  "OK, we have to get over to Brooke's house
right now and work on damage limitation.  I'm sure there are plenty
of hookers who fit Spam's description who she could visit discretely…
this doesn't have to be the end of the world.  Right?"</p>

<p>"Raght!  But Nic…would it really be so bad if Brookie did get
together with Sam?  Ah mean, she maght even start wrahtin' nice
things about us in the paper?"  Mary Cherry decided to look on the
bright side.  Nicole, however, saw no bright side.</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be so bad.  Now get ready, I'll be by to pick you up
in 15 minutes."</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the ranch…er Palace, Sam and Brooke hadn't spoken
since Sam had suggested they talk.  Brooke's heart had stopped as
soon as the words had left Sam's mouth.  Sam, for her part, was
seriously wishing she had just pretended that Carmen's phone call had
never happened.  She could repress memories, it would be worth the
therapy bills later in life to avoid the excruciatingly awkward
situation she now found herself in.  Too late for that now.  She
decided that she'd better say something quickly, Brooke seemed to
have stopped breathing and a slight tinge of blue was apparent on her
face.</p>

<p>"So…is it true?"</p>

<p>Brooke thought about stalling for time by saying `Is what true,
Sam?'  She quickly decided against this as it would involve hearing
Sam detail exactly what she had heard and that would just add to the
tension in the room.  She bowed her head and fiddled with the corner
of a pillow.</p>

<p>"Yes."  The word was little more than a whisper.  </p>

<p>Sam was now stumped for what to say next.  She had thought that
Brooke might deny it, thereby prompting an argument about her
insinuating that Carmen was a liar.  Then they would scream and shout
and hurl insults at each other.  She was comfortable with that.  That
would be familiar.  But that wasn't going to happen.  Sam looked over
at Brooke and saw the total misery she was in.  It was obvious in her
whole body – the slumped shoulders, head down, hugging a pillow for
comfort.  Suddenly Sam had an overwhelming urge to hug the other
girl.  She resisted it, that really would only complicate things at
this stage.</p>

<p>"So, ummm, is that why Nicole looked like she was about to strangle
me earlier…and why Mary Cherry asked that question in bio?"</p>

<p>Brooke could only nod.  She didn't trust her voice not to waver when
she spoke.  Sam's next question was the one she had wanted to ask
since she had come in…but at the same time she didn't want to know
the answer.  She had an idea what it might be though.</p>

<p>"I…uh…when Ms Glass said that …that sometimes there are other…
feelings…with these dreams…is that…I mean…do you…with me…I…" Well
that was articulate, thought Sam.</p>

<p>She didn't have to rephrase the question because Brooke was nodding
her head again.  </p>

<p>"Right…right…well maybe you should…kind of…tell me how you feel…and
we can go on from there."</p>

<p>Brooke looked up.  Sam was asking her to tell her how she felt.  Just
like Dream-Sam had.   She remembered the words clearly.  "Tell me how
you feel.  Give me a chance."  A chance.  It was the least that Sam
deserved.   The least that they both deserved.  Brooke took a deep
breath and stepped into the great unknown.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke kept her eyes firmly on the bed as she began to speak.  </p>

<p>"I… umm, don't actually know what to say to you.  I'm not sure
exactly what you've heard but the gist of it is that I've been having
dreams…about…you know…with you and they've really been getting to me
because since I started having them I keep noticing you and…no, no
that's not true…I've been noticing you for a while…and these
underlying feelings Ms Glass was talking about…well I've definitely
got them…for you…I'm sorry, that probably makes you feel really
uncomfortable…and I wasn't going to tell you…I shouldn't have told
anyone really…if I hadn't none of this would be happening and I could
keep on pretending to hate you...but it is happening and I don't hate
you…in fact I'm pretty sure that I…love you…I didn't mean to and I
don't want you to hate me…but I had to…"  </p>

<p>Brooke looked up at Sam, terrified of what she would see when she
did.  When their eyes met Brooke was surprised to see that there was
no disgust, no hatred.  There was only…well, she wasn't quite sure
what the look in Sam's eyes meant as she'd never seen it before.  Sam
cleared her throat and blinked her eyes a few times before replying.</p>

<p>"Don't ever apologise for your feelings Brooke.  You should never
have to say sorry for the way you feel.  And I don't hate you.  If
I'm totally honest I never have, I…I just…it was easier to hate you
than to admit that…God, I'm the journalist, I'm supposed to have a
way with words."  </p>

<p>Sam laughed and looked at the ceiling.  Brooke laughed too,
nervously, unsure of exactly what she was laughing at.  When Sam
looked back at Brooke her eyes were glistening and when she spoke her
voice quivered.</p>

<p>"I've imagined this a million times…and I've come up with a million
different ways to say what I want to say to you.  But none of them
really seem appropriate."  Sam bit her lip, wishing her throat wasn't
so tight.  "So, instead of rambling on here and making no sense
whatsoever…I think I'll just…"  </p>

<p>And without elaborating further, Sam leaned over to Brooke and
brought their lips together.  The kiss was chaste, almost sisterly,
lips pressed gently against each other, neither pushing for more.
Sam pulled away, looking to Brooke for a reaction.  To say Brooke was
shocked was putting it mildly.  She sat, a finger tracing her lips,
eyes wide and staring at Sam in what Sam hoped was wonder.  She
started to speak.</p>

<p>"I…of all the things I thought you'd do after I'd said what I just
said…that was…actually nowhere on the list." </p>

<p>Brooke laughed, the earlier tension was gone and had been replaced by
something entirely new and fresh.  Sam joined in the laughter.  It
felt good that they could laugh together.   When the giggling
subsided they looked at each other.  Brooke reached out tentatively
and took Sam's hand.  They sat in comfortable silence for a while
before either felt the need to speak.  It was Brooke who spoke first.</p>

<p>"So…I guess this means…actually I don't know what it means…do you?"</p>

<p>"Nope.  And I don't care.  Why does it have to mean anything?  Why
can't it just be what it is?  It should be fun finding out what it
is, don't you think?" she added, the lop-sided smile that Brooke
adored so much adorning her features.</p>

<p>Brooke nodded.  Her eyes were drawn to Sam's lips.  Their kiss had
been short and she had been so stunned by it that she hadn't really
been able to take in what was happening.  Plus, she hadn't had the
chance to find out exactly how talented Sam was with her tongue.  She
brought up the hand that wasn't in Sam's to touch her cheek softly.  </p>

<p>"Can I kiss you?" she whispered, looking deeply into Sam's eyes,
willing her to acquiesce.   </p>

<p>"You can kiss me any time you want to." Sam replied throatily.  </p>

<p>Brooke smiled and brought both hands to cup Sam's face.  She kept her
eyes locked into Sam's, wanting to remember everything about the
first time she kissed her.  When their lips touched, Sam's eyes
closed.  Brooke was riveted by the expression on the other girl's
face – complete happiness.  And then it happened, Sam's tongue gently
traced her lower lip.  Despite having dreamed about it, and
fantasised about it, on numerous occasions, nothing prepared her for
the real feelings associated with kissing Sam.  She finally allowed
her eyes to close as Sam's tongue entered her mouth, savouring the
intimate connection they were sharing.  And Sam had every right to be
proud of that particular muscle, it was very skilled indeed, sending
electric currents through Brooke with every movement.  Sam's arms
wound themselves around Brooke's body, pulling them closer together
as the kiss deepened.  Brooke held onto Sam's shoulders, never
wanting the sensations to end.  They stayed tangled in that embrace
until a lack of oxygen forced them reluctantly to part.  Brooke
buried her face in Sam's shoulder, holding her tightly.  Sam tried to
get her breathing back to normal as she stroked Brooke's hair.  As
she did so she realised that Brooke was sobbing.</p>

<p>"Hey…" she said softly. "Hey what's wrong?  I'm not that bad a kisser
am I?"  She pulled away slightly, trying to see Brooke's face.  She
felt Brooke's sobs mingle with laughter.   She sat up and wiped her
eyes with her sleeve before kissing Sam's forehead and then her nose,
and finally her lips.</p>

<p>"No.  Most definitely not.  You are a fantastic kisser.  It's just…
all this…" she gestured to herself and Sam and the room in
general.  "I can't believe it's happening…I can't believe that I'm
here, kissing you…I keep waiting for my alarm to go off, or for your
mom to call me down to breakfast…I can't believe that you'd want me."</p>

<p>It was Sam's turn to be surprised.  "You're kidding me right?  And,
by the way, do you think we could not mention my mother again?  It
feels a bit weird to bring her into this."  She paused and shivered.
Then she took Brooke's hand and continued, looking earnestly into her
eyes.  "Brooke, do you even know how wonderful you are?  And not just
because you're absolutely stunningly gorgeous…if that was the case I
wouldn't be here right now…it's because of who you are…you're kind,
and sweet, and funny and not how I thought you'd be at all.  You're
almost the exact opposite of what I thought you'd be."</p>

<p>"Almost the exact opposite?" Brooke asked teasingly.</p>

<p>"Yep, I was right about the vain part." </p>

<p>The words had barely been spoken when Sam's head connected with the
pillow Brooke had hurled at her.  She retaliated and before long the
situation had escalated into a fully-fledged pillow fight.  Sam soon
realised that she was fighting a losing battle and resorted to sneaky
underhand tactics.  These consisted of grabbing Brooke and kissing
her deeply until she dropped her weapon.  Brooke was happy to let
herself be conquered by Sam's lips.  When they broke apart they
remained in each other's arms on Brooke's bed.  Brooke's head was on
Sam's chest, enjoying the rapid rise and fall of her breathing caused
by the exertions of a few minutes previous.  Sam stared at the
ceiling, running her hand up and down Brooke's arm.  A thought
occurred to her and she smiled wickedly.</p>

<p>"So…" she began, casually.  "I hear that I'm pretty hot in the
sack."  This comment earned her an elbow to the stomach.  "What?  I
can see that I'm going to have to watch myself around you and your
violent tendencies."</p>

<p>Brooke was blushing furiously but valiantly tried to assume a haughty
expression as she propped herself up on an elbow to look at Sam.  </p>

<p>"If I've got violent tendencies it's only because you bring them out
in me." she said.  "And I never said you were `hot in the sack'."</p>

<p>"No?  Funny.  Mary Cherry said that I was…what was it now?  `A tiger
between the sheets'" Sam watched Brooke's colour deepen significantly
and laughed.  </p>

<p>"Well, whatever…all that means is that you've got a lot to live up
to." Brooke said, pleading with her body to remove the blood from her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"I'm always up for a challenge." Sam said, she was smiling but her
voice carried serious undertones.  She was actually worried about the
physical side of things.  She wasn't the most experienced person in
that department.  And now Brooke had certain expectations of her.
But Brooke was shaking her head.</p>

<p>"I'm kidding.  Sam, when we…I mean, if we…"</p>

<p>"I think you were pretty safe with `when'" Sam put in with a smile.</p>

<p>"OK, when we make love it'll be perfect.  You'll be perfect."  She
leaned down to place a quick kiss on Sam's lips.  Sam smiled up at
her, toying with a strand of blonde hair.  They were in that position
when they heard the commotion coming from outside.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Brooke asked in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know…but that sounded like Carmen's voice." Sam sat up and
strained to hear what was happening.</p>

<p>["Well Lil' Lily, if your shameless hussy of a friend hadn't paraded
herself around battin' her big puppy dog eyes in front of poor
Brookie we wouldn't be in this mess raght now!"]</p>

<p>"And that was definitely Mary Cherry." Brooke said, trepidation
evident in her voice.</p>

<p>["Well it's not Sam that's having lurid fantasies about her step-
sister is it?"]</p>

<p>"If only she knew," said Sam.  Brooke smiled.</p>

<p>["Listen twinkies, I think you'd better leave this to us now and go
home.  The neighbours are going to start complaining.   They don't
like common people around these parts.  In fact property prices
plummeted as soon as they set eyes on Spam"]</p>

<p>["Why you…!"]</p>

<p>This was followed by a great deal of scuffling and the occasional
smack of a blow hitting its intended target.  Brooke and Sam looked
at each other.  Without saying a word they jumped off the bed and ran
towards the stairs.  They had no idea what they were going to do when
they reached the door, but something needed to be done if bloodshed
was to be avoided.  Of course, when the occupants of the doorstep
found out what had just happened between them, bloodshed was still a
very real possibility…</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke and Sam were not quite prepared for the scene that awaited
them when they opened the front door.  Mary Cherry and Lily were
rolling around on the doorstep throttling each other.  They had both
gone an interesting shade of purple through asphyxiation but neither
was willing to submit.  Brooke's eyes were drawn away from the
wrestling match when a streak flew across the garden.  The streak
turned out to be Carmen who was being hotly pursued by Nicole.  The
reason for her haste was the designer stiletto heel Nicole was
brandishing menacingly.  Brooke shivered at the look on Nicole's
face, it reminded her of Hannibal Lecter: very little emotion but you
knew something terrifying was lurking behind the stare.  Brooke
looked at Sam.</p>

<p>"Which one do you want?" she asked, which was a bit like asking her
to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea.</p>

<p>"I…uh…well, I think Nicole is more likely to turn on me with that
thing than she is you."  Sam watched the diminutive blonde's dogged
pursuit of Carmen with equal parts fascination and terror.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, that's true, now that I got you I don't want someone sticking
a Prada heel through your forehead." Brooke said in a low voice,
smiling seductively.</p>

<p>"I knew you only liked me for my unblemished looks." Sam joked.</p>

<p>"Well, I was more thinking of the damage one of those things could do
to your brain, but if you prefer to think I'm only after your body,
feel free."  </p>

<p>They smiled warmly at each other and under any other circumstances a
kiss would have been inevitable.  However, they were very rudely
interrupted by the exaggerated choking noises coming from Mary Cherry,</p>

<p>"We'd better…"</p>

<p>"Right…right, we'll continue this later." Sam said.</p>

<p>"You promise?" Brooke asked over her shoulder as she headed out into
No-Man's Land, perhaps never to return.</p>

<p>Sam winked in response.  She then sighed as she looked down at the
struggle taking place at her feet.  From the look of it, Lily had the
advantage as she was on top.  But then, Mary Cherry executed some
sort of flip and Lily landed on her back with the Southerner grinning
insanely at her from above.  Sam took a minute to formulate some sort
of strategy and then decided against that, throwing herself on Mary
Cherry's back and grabbing her in a head lock.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brooke was chasing after Nicole who was still chasing
Carmen.  It was like something out of one of those old cops and
robbers movies where everything happens speeded up.  Eventually
Brooke gave up the chase, waiting instead for Nicole to pass her and
launching herself at her waist, tackling her to the ground.  When
Carmen realised Nicole had been stopped she wandered cautiously back
to where Brooke was sitting on top of her.  And for some unknown
reason Carmen decided to resort to playground victory tactics.</p>

<p>"Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!" </p>

<p>This was followed by the ritual sticking out of the tongue.  It turns
out that this was an unwise move as it only succeeded in pouring
napalm on the already blazing fire of Nicole's fury.  Enraged beyond
words, Nicole got her second wind and threw Brooke off.  Carmen
sensed that perhaps she'd better get off her mark and turned around
to run but Nicole was already on her, although thankfully she had
lost her expensive weapon in the earlier tackle.   Brooke looked up
from her vantage point on the ground and sighed as Carmen attempted
to run with Nicole hanging from her neck.</p>

<p>Sam was not faring well either.  She had managed to get herself in
between the warring twosome, however, this had resulted in them
throttling her instead of each other.  Deciding that self-
preservation was called for, Sam wriggled her way free and allowed
Mary Cherry and Lily to once again get their hands around each
other's throats.</p>

<p>Just when Sam and Brooke were about to give up and start arranging
the funerals, a godsend turned up.  This came in the unusual form of
Josh and Sugar Daddy.</p>

<p>"SD!" Sam shouted.  "Over here, quick."  She gestured frantically at
Mary Cherry and Lily.</p>

<p>"Yo bro, it's a smackdown." Sugar Daddy observed as he hurried
towards Sam to lend a hand.  </p>

<p>Upon his arrival Lily had once again gained the upper hand and was on
top.  Sugar Daddy merely reached down and grabbed the back of her
jacket, lifting her up the way a cat does a kitten.  And just like a
kitten Lily continued to hiss and scratch all the way up until she
was dangling from SD's strong arm.  Mary Cherry made a show of
hitting and kicking at Lily's body but in reality she was relieved to
be away from those ferret teeth.   After the initial display of
bravado, both girls gave way to the exhaustion caused by getting very
little oxygen for a prolonged period of time.  SD dropped Lily to the
ground.   She lay side by side with Mary Cherry, eyes closed,
breathing heavily.  </p>

<p>Sam clapped SD on the back in thanks.  She walked over to where
Brooke lay on the lawn and pulled her into a standing position and
they both watched Josh get beat up by Nicole.  It was entertaining to
say the least.  Carmen had retreated to a safe distance and was also
enjoying the show.  Eventually Josh managed to pin Nicole's arms to
her sides and lift her up.  She continued to kick his shins as he
walked towards Brooke and Sam.  </p>

<p>"Where do you want her?" he asked, gritting his teeth against the
pain in his legs.</p>

<p>"Inside."  said Brooke, trying to ignore the look Nicole was giving
her.  "I think we should all talk."</p>

<p>  She looked to Sam for confirmation.  Sam nodded in agreement.  Josh
headed, stiltedly, towards the house.  Sugar Daddy picked up Lily and
Mary Cherry, throwing them over either shoulder and taking them
inside.  Carmen cast a knowing look at the way Sam and Brooke were
standing just a little too closely together before joining the others
in the house.</p>

<p>Sam leaned her forehead against Brooke's cheek and sighed.  Brooke
wrapped her arms around Sam and pulled her into a comforting embrace.</p>

<p>"Well, I can just tell this is going to be fun." Sam said, sarcasm
coating every syllable.</p>

<p>"Yep…but I suppose it's good that we have them all here at once…at
least we won't have to go through it again and again."</p>

<p>"I suppose."  Sam lifted her head and kissed Brooke softly.</p>

<p>"What was that for?"

"Dutch courage."</p>

<p>"Isn't that alcohol?"</p>

<p>"Well…let's call it `Brooke Courage' then."</p>

<p>"OK, need anymore?"</p>

<p>"Lots, but I don't think we should leave them alone in there for much
longer."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're right….one for the road?"</p>

<p>Sam grinned and complied.  They kissed slowly, tenderly, lovingly.
When they pulled apart they looked into each other's eyes and
resolved silently to be strong for each other during what was bound
to be a trial of any relationship, never mind one that was born that
very afternoon.  Clasping hands the slowly made their way to face
their friends.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Seating in the living room was something of a problem.  Nicole had to
be kept as far away from Carmen as possible.  She also couldn't be
placed anywhere near Sam as was discovered when she tripped Sam up on
her way past sending her flying into Sugar who was trying to figure
out where to put the two rag dolls over his shoulders.  Eventually
everybody got settled.  Nicole sat in an armchair, arms crossed, lips
pursed, eyeing Sam with startling viciousness.  Mary Cherry had
insisted she needed a whole couch on which to rest her bruised and
bitten body.  This left the other couch free for SD, Carmen and Josh
to sit on with Lily lying along their laps.  Only Brooke and Sam
remained standing.  They felt like they were facing a firing squad.
Brooke decided to take charge and get things out in the open before
someone, probably Nicole, erupted again.</p>

<p>"OK…I'm pretty sure you're all here for the same reason.  You all
heard about my…dreams…at school today.  Just how everybody found out
we won't bother with at the moment" She looked pointedly at Mary
Cherry who smiled inanely and continued to examine her (mostly
imaginary) battle scars.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, because that's way besides the point." Nicole spoke, her voice
low with contained anger. "The point is that they were just dreams
and they will pass.  This really isn't a crisis.  Mary Cherry and I
came over here as your friends, to help you get through this awful
episode and get back to normal.  I have no idea why these rejects
showed up…probably to help Spam gloat about her part in the downfall
of the school's reigning monarch."  She shot poisonous looks at
Carmen and Lily.</p>

<p>"No, actually Nicole we came to make sure that everybody was
alright.  After I told Sam we thought that things might get a little…
well actually it was mostly Lily who thought it…" Carmen now laughed
half-heartedly at the absurdity of it. "…Lily thought that Sam might
be murdering Brooke or something." </p>

<p>Sam and Brooke looked at each other with raised eyebrows.  Things had
indeed turned physical after the little revelation…but it was a
different sort of physical.  Nicole stood up suddenly and the whole
room collectively drew in a breath and held it.  She headed for
Brooke.  Sam moved slightly so that she was standing behind Brooke,
shielding herself from the oncoming attack.  Brooke put a hand on
Sam's thigh surreptitiously to reassure her that she wouldn't let
Nicole do anything.  Nicole moved in close to Brooke and took hold of
her elbow.</p>

<p>"Come on Brookie, let's go somewhere private where we can talk about
this.  In no time at all you'll be back to yourself, wearing the
right shade of nail-polish instead of whatever that hideous stuff
is." she added, noticing the deep red colour on Brooke's nails.</p>

<p>"This is Sam's." Brooke stated, she wasn't quite sure why she had to
say that, she knew it would only aggravate Nicole further.  "And no,
we can't go somewhere private.  I have someth…no, actually we have
something we'd like to say." As she spoke she took Sam's hand into
her own and pulled her out from behind her.</p>

<p>Nicole looked aghast.  The gesture could only mean one thing.  And it
spelled the end of her days as the second most popular person at
Kennedy High.  She stepped away from the couple, shaking her head in
disbelief.  Brooke took a deep breath and continued, forcing herself
to go ahead with what she'd planned to say.</p>

<p>"OK you all know that I've been dreaming about Sam.  And you all
heard Ms Glass talking about dreams sometimes meaning that there are
feelings there that haven't been acknowledged.  Well, I finally
decided to acknowledge the fact that I have feelings, deep feelings
for Sam.  And, under duress, I told her how I felt.  And to my
eternal amazement and gratitude…" she now turned to look into Sam's
eyes, speaking to her despite the fact that they had an avid
audience. "…she feels the same way about me.  And we want to try to…
I'm not sure what we want to try to do…we only know that we have to
give this a chance and see where it takes us." Sam smiled and
squeezed Brooke's hand in silent confirmation. Brooke turned back to
the assembled crowd, trying not to be put off by the six open-mouthed
expressions facing her. "I know this is kind of out of the blue for
all of you and we all have to adjust to it, but we thought that it
was only fair that we inform you of the situation."</p>

<p>Silence.  And not the comfortable silence friends can often find
themselves in.  This was the kind of silence that everyone was
excruciatingly aware of and no-one had the faintest idea of how to
break it.  Finally Sam could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"So…does anybody have any questions or anything?"  She cursed herself
after asking this.  It was the kind of thing teachers asked in class
after finishing a lesson.  The regret increased when Mary Cherry's
hand shot up, negating her weak and feeble act.</p>

<p>"What is it Mary Cherry?" asked Brooke, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Ah just wanted to say that ah am totally not against relations
between people of the same gender…what ah have a problem with is
sexual shenanigans between people of completely opposin' social
groups…ah mean…does this signal our descent into the proletariat of
Kennedy high?  Am ah never again to walk down the corridors, faghtin'
off admirers and dismissin' freaks with a superior look and a witty
put down?  Am ah to be reduced to eatin' lunch with lil' Lily,
hearin' her squawkin' on about how many cows and other assorted farm
animals have died to make the mystery meat in the cafeteria?"  Mary
Cherry had worked herself up into a frenzy and had to lie back down
and fan herself to avoid fainting for the second time that day.</p>

<p>Brooke was about to reply when Nicole broke in.</p>

<p>"She has a point.  It's obvious what Spam gets out of this little
union.  She gets prestige and elevation to somewhere above the gutter
where she currently resides.  I mean, dating the head cheerleader is
always an admirable quality.  And by association, her little posse
move up a notch."  She looked Brooke straight in the eye.  "But what
I don't get is you.  What are you getting out of all this?  A little
sexual thrill?  The excitement of groping while your parents make
dinner downstairs?  Let me tell you hun, that'll wear off.  And when
it does, where will you be?  A social leper.   An outcast.  Is
smooching with Spammy really worth all that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."  The word was spoken with absolute certainty.  Brooke advanced
on Nicole, spurred on by the little speech she'd just been subjected
to.  "Nicole, if you were any sort of friend you would be there for
me.  You would be more concerned with my feelings than what my
actions meant for your popularity rating.   I bet Sam's friends
aren't rubbing their hands together right now, thinking how this will
improve their social standing.  But of course, they're real friends
who care about each other.  Not like us.  We only care about what
other people think about us.  If people think we're cool and
important then everything's OK.  If something like this happens, it's
the end of the world right?  Because people might not approve of my
choice.  Well let me tell you this Nic, I don't give a damn about
what other people think.  I'm perfectly happy with what I'm doing and
so is Sam and that's what matters.  Nothing else.  I would like to
have the support of my friends in this but from your reaction I can
see that I don't have that.  Or is it that I don't have friends?"
Brooke paused and sighed, emotionally tired.  "Nicole, I want us to
be friends, I want us to be real friends and I want to give a damn
about what you think.  But if you truly care more about what this
will do to your reputation…then that's it…we're finished."</p>

<p>And with that she turned around and walked back to Sam, throwing an
arm around her shoulders in a defiant gesture.  The occupants of the
room once again found themselves stunned into silence.  Nicole looked
around her, no-one met her gaze.  She felt her throat become tight
and her eyes well up.  She'd be damned before she'd cry in a room
full of people.  She cast one last look at Brooke, spun around and
marched out of the room.  Mary Cherry stood up and started to follow
her.  At the door she stopped and turned to face the room again.</p>

<p>"Brookie…ah just…what ah mean is…well…ahm glad you're happy is all."
And for once the sentiment was genuine.  Brooke and Sam smiled at
Mary Cherry.  She smiled back and then ran after Nicole, who after
all, was her ride.</p>

<p>The remaining people in the living room let go of the collective
breath they'd been holding since Brooke had launched into her
speech.  Carmen nudged Lily, telling her to get off their laps so
they could stand up.  When everyone was upright the six of them
exchanged awkward smiles.</p>

<p>"So…uh…I think we should leave you guys alone right now…obviously no-
one's killing anyone else and nobody's having a breakdown…except
maybe me…and I'm sure you want to do stuff…I mean…talk…not…whatever
you thought I meant…" Carmen trailed off before she got herself in
even deeper.  The other three nodded in agreement.  They all needed
time to process what they had heard and seen.  Discussions could be
held at a later date.</p>

<p>"And we think it's…great…that you're…dating or whatever." Lily
stumbled over her words, unsure of the correct decorum in such
situations.  Again the other three nodded in unison.  Josh looked a
little strange and Brooke resolved to have a private chat with him at
some point.</p>

<p>"Thanks you guys," said Sam. "You don't know how much that means to
us."  She smiled to herself at the automatic use of the word `us'.
This must come naturally when one is part of a couple she thought.</p>

<p>"Totally!" Brooke agreed, joining in with the nodding.</p>

<p>"OK, so, we'll see you later." Josh spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>"Yeah, later."</p>

<p>Lily, Carmen, Sugar Daddy and Josh walked out of the room in single
file, leaving Brooke and Sam to stare at each other wordlessly.</p>

<p>"See I told you it'd be fun.," said Sam.</p>

<p>"It was definitely something." </p>

<p>Brooke was a little shocked at the way she had spoken to Nicole, and
a little worried about the consequences of her words.  Sam sensed
that she was troubled and moved to take her into her arms.  She held
her tightly.  Brooke returned the hug almost desperately, needing
something to cling to.</p>

<p>"What you said here today…it was…it made me feel so special." Sam
whispered into Brooke's ear.</p>

<p>"You are so special, Sam."</p>

<p>Sam gave Brooke a lopsided smile before capturing her lips in a
kiss.  They allowed themselves to become lost in the wonder of each
other.  They had a lot to talk about, but it could wait for now.  Now
was for kissing….lots of kissing.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke sighed as she ran her hand through Sam's dark tresses.  Sam's
head was resting on her lap and they had been staring into each
other's eyes for an undetermined amount of time.  It was strange,
whenever she and Josh had tried these `romantic' things she had
become very bored, very quickly.  But she was positive that she would
never grow tired of looking at Sam, or kissing Sam, or touching Sam
or Sam in general.  She smiled at these thoughts and Sam smiled with
her though she had not been privy to the origin of the smile.  </p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"You." Brooke stated simply.</p>

<p>"Picturing me naked again huh?"</p>

<p>"Busted!" Brooke leaned down and kissed Sam's lips.</p>

<p>When she sat back up they resumed the gazing lovingly at one another.</p>

<p>"Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Hmmm?"</p>

<p>"You know we had that little talk in the Novak…the one when you told
me not to rush into my first time?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Are you sticking by that?"</p>

<p>"Why Samantha, are you suggesting that I imparted that advice to you
just so you wouldn't sleep with anyone but me?"</p>

<p>"No…is that why you said it?"  Sam was curious, but the reason she
had asked the question in the first place was because she really,
really wanted to rush into her first time…like, right now.</p>

<p>"Sam, I said it because I meant it.  I had sex with someone I didn't
love and it was…well it wasn't what the magazines tell you it should
be like.  Like you told me, there has to be a deeper connection there
for a relationship to work."  She laced her fingers through
Sam's.  "I already know that what you and I have is on a whole other
level to the Josh thing."  She paused.  "Does it bother you?  Me
talking like this?  I know it's kind of heavy when we've only been
going out with each other less than a day but…"</p>

<p>"It doesn't bother me in the slightest.  Brooke, I've felt this way
about you for a while, and I think you have too…so it's not like
neither of us has considered these things."  Sam sat up so she was on
eye level with Brooke.   She dipped her head slightly and looked at
Brooke through her dark lashes.  "It's not the only thing I've been
considering.  Brooke, I really want to make love with you…God, I'm so
embarrassed saying that…but it's how I feel.  I know I'm ready…and
it's not just like a `I want to lose my virginity' thing.  It's a `I
really really want to make love with Brooke McQueen' thing."</p>

<p>Brooke brought her hand up to caress Sam's cheek.  She moved so that
they were as close as possible and rubbed her nose gently against
Sam's.</p>

<p>"And I want to make love with you too, believe me.  But don't you
think we should wait just a little while?  I mean, we haven't even
been on a date yet…I wouldn't want you getting a reputation for being
easy."  Brooke felt Sam's lips turn up in a smile against her own.</p>

<p>"No, we couldn't have people thinking you had taken advantage of me."
She kissed Brooke lightly on the cheek and sighed.  "Of course, it's
easier for you…you've had the pleasure of nightly sex sessions in
your dreams haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, and you think that's made it easier?  Uh uh.  It's only added to
the frustration babe!  I usually get woken up before…"  Brooke was
unsure of how to finish her sentence.</p>

<p>Sam was grinning. "Oh, so it's like that?  Brookie wasn't getting no
satisfaction?"</p>

<p>"Exactly." said Brooke, getting a far-away look in her eyes. "Do you
know what it was like for me to bump into you in the bathroom or sit
across from you at breakfast just after one of those dreams?"  </p>

<p>"Oh, I have a fair idea.  You think I don't have fantasies?"  Sam
raised her eyebrows in a challenge.  "In fact, I'm thinking you could
help me find out if a few of them are workable."</p>

<p>"It will be my pleasure Ms McPherson."</p>

<p>Sam smiled and impulsively pulled Brooke to her for a kiss.  The
sudden movement caused Brooke to fall on top of Sam.  The
conversation topic made them both hyper-aware of their position, and
yet neither one moved to adjust it.  Sam reached up and traced
Brooke's lips with her finger, still marvelling at their softness.
The need to taste them grew too much and Sam pulled Brooke down to
meet her lips in a heated kiss.  Brooke felt her earlier resolve
slipping as she felt Sam's hand slide up her back, under her shirt.
She knew she should stop, slow things down, but she really didn't
want to.  Brooke's morals and Sam's virginity were saved by the
bell.  Actually, by the phone ringing.</p>

<p>"Ignore it." Sam mumbled against Brooke's mouth.</p>

<p>"No, come on Sam, we said we were going to be sensible and wait.
Maybe this is a sign from God." Brooke smirked as she leaned over and
picked up the phone, still lying on top of Sam.  "Hello?"</p>

<p>["Hey B."]</p>

<p>Brooke was shocked.  She hadn't expected to hear that voice on the
end of the line for quite some time.</p>

<p>"Nicole, uh, hey."  Sam looked at Brooke with raised eyebrows and
used gestures to ask if she wanted her to leave.  Brooke shook her
head.  Sam couldn't go anywhere anyway.  She was totally pinned under
Brooke; not that it was unpleasant in any way.</p>

<p>["So…I wanted to speak to you about earlier…what you said."]</p>

<p>"I meant it Nicole so don't try and change my mind." Brooke was
resolute and Sam's heart swelled with pride and love.</p>

<p>["I know you meant it…and it made me think.  When you said that we
weren't real friends…well that hurt me.  I want us to be friends
Brookie.  I do care about you and I'm willing to show you I do.  And
if that means accepting Spam as your lesbian life partner or whatever
she is then fine."]</p>

<p>Brooke was taken aback and very deeply touched.  She knew it had
taken a lot for Nicole to say these things.</p>

<p>"Thank you Nic.  I mean that.  And we are friends, best friends."
Her voice was thick with emotion.</p>

<p>["Yeah well, if we have to be unpopular at least we can be unpopular
together right?"]</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>["Oh, just one question hun, you don't expect me to be nice to Spam
do you?  Because I think that'd be a bit much to ask."]</p>

<p>Brooke laughed out loud.  "No…no, I can't tell you who to be nice
to.  Just like I can't tell her not to write condemning editorials
about you in the future…"  Brooke left this hanging for Nicole to
consider.  Sam was trying to piece the conversation together from
only hearing half of it.  From what she could gather Nicole had
responded positively and she was glad.  For Brooke, not for Nicole.</p>

<p>["Ummm, OK.  Well, I'll see you at school."]</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>["I should have seen this coming you know.  When you chose shop class
over home economics, I should have guessed it then."]</p>

<p>"Goodbye Nic."  Brooke shook her head.</p>

<p>["Bye Brookie."]</p>

<p>Brooke hung the phone up and looked down at Sam.</p>

<p>"She wants us to try to be `real' friends."</p>

<p>"Well that's…nice."</p>

<p>"I know you don't like her but…I guess my life wouldn't be the same
without her in it."</p>

<p>"None of our lives would be the same if she wasn't in them…and I'm
not so sure that would be a bad thing."</p>

<p>"Sam!" Brooke said reproachfully. </p>

<p>"Sorry, kidding." </p>

<p>Just then they heard the sound of the front door closing and a voice
floating in from the hallway.</p>

<p>"Sam?  Hey are you home?  The door was open so I just…" Harrison
arrived in the living room and his train of thought jumped the tracks
when confronted by the sight of Brooke and Sam lying tangled around
each other on the couch.  "Hey…guys…"</p>

<p>Sam looked up at Brooke.  So much for telling everyone in one fell
swoop. </p>

<p>"Hey Harrison."</p>

<p>"I…uh…why are you lying like that?"</p>

<p>"Funny you should ask that Harrison…we actually have something to
tell you."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Harrison waited patiently while Brooke climbed off Sam and they stood
up, straightening out their clothes as they did so.  Brooke noticed
that Sam was shaking.  Naturally she would be concerned about
Harrison's reaction to the news – he was her best friend.  Brooke
wanted to take Sam's hand to offer her support but thought that,
under the circumstances it wouldn't be the best idea.  Sam cleared
her throat, more as a time-waster than out of necessity.</p>

<p>"Uh, Harrison...so how's it going?"  Sam smiled and Brooke nudged
her.  She ignored this.</p>

<p>"Fine, fine.  How about you guys?"</p>

<p>"Look, you probably heard some stuff at school today right?"</p>

<p>"No, actually, nothing interesting anyway." Harrison thought back
over his day but came up with nothing noteworthy. "Although, I did
have the feeling that there was something going on but I figured I
would hear about it sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Right, OK, so you have no idea what it was?"</p>

<p>"Nope." </p>

<p>Harrison looked at Sam, confused by her line of questioning.  Sam was
having palpitations.  This made things much more difficult.  At least
everybody else had an inkling of the subject at hand.  How do you
turn around and tell your best bud that you are involved with someone
he's been in love with his whole life?  But she could come up with no
answer to this question.</p>

<p>"Uh, look Harrison, there's a big long, convoluted story attached to
this thing that we have to tell you but it's sort of irrelevant when
you get down to the real point of the story so we should probably
just leave out the explanations and just come right out and tell you
what it is that people were talking about and the result of those
conversations because it's only fair that you know because we just
told everybody else and…"</p>

<p>Brooke felt an intervention was required.</p>

<p>"Shut up Sam."  </p>

<p>And Sam shut up.  Brooke turned to Harrison, knowing from Sam's
incoherent babbling that it was up to her to break the news. </p>

<p>"OK Harrison, the thing is that Sam and I are…involved…in a
relationship…with each other…in the romantic sense…so what do you
think?"  She finished nervously, she hadn't planned on being quite so
abrupt.</p>

<p>Both Harrison and Sam looked shell-shocked.  They stared at each
other for a long time.  Neither knew quite what to say.  Harrison
brought a hand up to his head and started smoothing his hair
compulsively.</p>

<p>"Harrison…" Sam took a step towards him.</p>

<p>"Wait." Harrison held his hand up and Sam stopped dead.  "I...kind of
need time to…think about this before I can talk to you."  He turned
to leave but then paused and turned back.  "This isn't me being
horrified or anything…it's just…a shock…you know?"</p>

<p>Both girls nodded, oh yeah, they knew all right.  He nodded back at
them and then walked out of the house.  Brooke turned to Sam and
smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p>"That went pretty well I think," she said brightly.  Sam was still
shaking quite visibly so Brooke stepped towards her and put her hands
on her shoulders, getting her attention.</p>

<p>"Hey…he said he just needs some time, that's understandable right?
Come on, it could have been worse, you could have Nicole as your best
friend."  </p>

<p>This comment earned a smile.  Sam brought an unsteady hand up to tuck
her hair behind her ear.  Brooke caught the hand and brought it to
her lips, kissing it softly before placing it over her heart.  Sam
watched the actions closely and then looked up into Brooke's eyes.</p>

<p>"Everything will be fine, I promise."  </p>

<p>Brooke's words were spoken with such certainty that Sam believed them
without question.  She moved closer to Brooke and rested her head on
her shoulder, feeling a wave of comfort wash over her as Brooke's
arms came up to encircle her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, he'll be fine…I mean, I suppose he'll chew me out a bit for
stealing the object of his affection, but he's not a bigot or
anything, he'll be fine." She spoke to convince herself as much as
Brooke.</p>

<p>"Of course he will, how could he risk losing a friend like you?"</p>

<p>Sam lifted her head once more to look Brooke in the face.</p>

<p>"You say the most amazing things…you send shivers right through me
when you talk like that."</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm only telling the truth.  Harrison's not dumb.  He knows
that he'll never find anyone else like you.  And by the way, as for
stealing me away from him…he never stood a chance against you so it's
better that he found out now so he can move on."</p>

<p>"There you go again, I'm all tingly," said Sam as she leaned in to
place a long, sensuous kiss on Brooke's lips.</p>

<p>"Hmmm, and now I'm all tingly."  Brooke laughed and hugged Sam
tighter.</p>

<p>"Brooke, how about we go out and get a pizza or something."  Sam
asked, casually.</p>

<p>"Are you asking me out on a date?" </p>

<p>"Well, I'm hungry and I thought we deserved a treat after the day
we've just been through…" She was suddenly very interested in a
strand of Brooke's hair that she had been playing with, "…and, you
know…there's always the chance that we might want to come back here
and…have dessert."</p>

<p>"Dessert huh?"  Brooke pretended to consider the offer.  "I guess I
could manage a few slices of pizza…not sure I'll have room for
dessert though."</p>

<p>Sam looked up quickly and was relieved to see the twinkle in Brooke's
eye.  She punched her lightly in the shoulder.</p>

<p>"You might change your mind when you see what's on the dessert menu."</p>

<p>"You think there'll be something to tempt me?"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah, something positively mouth-watering."</p>

<p>Brooke grinned.  "Someone's got a high opinion of herself."  She
kissed Sam's nose. "Lucky I've got an even higher one of her." she
added in a husky voice.  Her face became serious as she
continued.  "Are you sure you want to do this tonight Sam?  Because
we have plenty of time, we can wait…"</p>

<p>"I'm sure.  I'm very sure.  I want to be with you Brooke, and I don't
think there's any point in waiting another day or another week…I want
to be with you tonight."</p>

<p>The thought of waiting another week filled Brooke with dread.  She
looked into Sam's eyes, so full of trust and of love, and realised
that the amount of time was irrelevant.  What mattered was the depth
of feeling present.  And she knew that she had never had such intense
feelings for another person in her life.  It was only natural that
they should show their feelings in every way possible.  And if Sam
wanted to do it that night, then that night it would be.  Because it
was already clear to Brooke that it was going to be very difficult
for her ever to refuse Sam anything she wanted.  She brought a hand
up behind Sam's neck and pulled her in for a kiss.  The kiss was her
way of telling Sam that they would make love that night.  When they
parted they shared a look of understanding.</p>

<p>"OK, let's go for pizza."  said Sam.  "The quicker we go, the quicker
we can get back here and…have dessert."</p>
