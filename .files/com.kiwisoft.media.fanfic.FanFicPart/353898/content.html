<!-- Bound \ Chapter 7 - To Begin Again -->

<P>"Hey, Harry, Harry, wait up," Tom jogged down the corridor to meet his friend as hey made their way to the bridge.</P>
<P>"Did you hear what the doctor's been saying?"</P>
<P>"No, what new gossip have you got?"</P>
<P>"He said that Seven broke B'Elanna's jaw this morning. Can you believe that?"</P>
<P>"What, no way."</P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna looked at the sleeping woman and checked the time. She knew that Seven wouldn't be on duty for another 8 hours and she herself didn't need to be back for a while.</P>
<P>Very carefully, she lifted Seven and took her to the darkened bedroom. She hadn't realised that Seven could sleep so soundly. She placed her tenderly on the bed and looked at her, B'Elanna's heart hurt so much just to look at her. She knew without any doubt that she was falling headlong in love with Seven and couldn't do a damn thing about it.</P>
<P>She knelt down beside the bed and took off Seven's boots, she didn't want to wake her. B'Elanna sat on the bed with Seven's feet on her lap, she had been staring at them for the last 10 minutes, they were pale and slender and she had the cutest little implant on her ankle.</P>
<I><P>B'Elanna can you hear yourself? Your calling a Borg implant cute. Are you nuts? Boy you've got it bad.</P>
</I>
<P>She stood up and debated whether she should help Seven out of her of biosuit. On the one hand, Seven would sleep more comfortable without the tight restraining clothing, but on the other, B'Elanna had heard the rumours, seven was supposed to be stark naked underneath. That made her mind up for her. </P>
<P>"There's no way I can take the sensory overload of dealing with a big, naked Borg in my bed." She muttered to herself as she took off her uniform jacket and lay beside Seven.</P>
<P>Sometime during the night she heard Seven whimpering in her sleep and rolled over to cradle the sleeping Borg.</P>
<P>"Please forgive me, please forgive. I'm sorry ..." Seven mumbled in her sleep. She was tossing about on the bed, clearly in the grip of a nightmare. B'Elanna held her close and whispered gently in the cloud of blond hair.</P>
<P>"Hush, hush, darling, don't speak It's ok. It's over now. It's all over now." </P>
<P>B'Elanna continued to rock Seven, gently reassuring her, until the nightmare ended.</P>

<P>Several hours later, Seven woke up alone in B'Elanna's bed. She was still in her blue biosuit and had a blanket wrapped carefully around her.</P>
<P>She sat up and immediately groaned. Her head hurt, there was a dull throbbing and realised that she had a splitting headache. She walked to the bathroom checking the time. She had slept for over 5 hours, it was a strange sensation, sleeping. All Seven could recall was her unconscious mind being filled with images of her hurting B'Elanna over and over again, of being unable to stop hurting the woman she knew she loved. The nightmare had only stopped when she felt herself being cradled and loved the arms of the one she loved.</P>
<P>"Is this love?" Seven knew it was illogical, but she asked her reflection the question anyway.</P>
<P>Her reflection looked like shit and couldn't be bothered to respond. Seven's eyes were red and puffy and she had dark smudges under her eyes. Her chest felt tight and heavy. Seven knew that the guilt and self-loathing that she felt at her actions were like physical injuries that she didn't know how to heal.</P>
<P> Once she completed her toilette she walked through to the lounge with the intention of going back on duty, even though she wasn't due for a few hours yet.</P>
<P>On the table were several covered dishes and a data padd with a recorded message from B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven, I'll be back by 0600 hours. I want you to wait for me. We need to talk. (What, again? Just get on with it already. Author)</P>
<P> I know you need to eat so I've replicated a light meal for you. You should also drink the mug of papaya and kelp juice. I know it tastes foul, but it will soothe your headache. I ... I'll see you soon."</P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed to be on the verge of saying something else but signed off instead.</P>
<I><P>She still cares for my well being. Could she have really forgiven me?</I> Seven wondered as she tried to eat the meal that B'Elanna had prepared. The food tasted like ashes in her mouth, but her headache did ease as soon as she drank the strange concoction. Irrationally, Seven wished that she still had the pounding head. She deserved to suffer.</P>

<P>Her fork clattered onto her plate as the doors slid open and B'Elanna walked in. Seven met her gaze for the shortest of seconds and dropped her eyes to the floor. She couldn't bear to look at her.</P>
<P>B'Elanna strode over to her and gently grasped Seven by the chin, forcing her to look up and meet her eyes.</P>
<P>"Seven, look at me, I'm not angry at you any more. I know that you'll never do it again and I don't want us to keep going on about it. It's over. Let's move on."</P>
<P>The tears trembled on Seven's long black eyelashes.</P>
<P>"How can we go on. Where do we start?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna sank down to her knees between Seven's legs and leaned close.</P>
<P>"We start at the beginning and we take it slow. I'll teach you about love and emotions," the Klingon said softly as she gently traced the curve of Seven's shell-like ear. "And you can teach me about love and emotions," she continued, brushing her thumb along the shadows under Seven's eyes. "We both have a lot to learn about this relationship, but I promise you, we're going to make it work."</P>
<P>She leaned closer, her breath warm and sweet on Seven's face, her hands holding the blonde's face tenderly. "Do you believe me, Seven?" </P>
<P>Seven barely nodded, she was mesmerised by B'Elanna mouth.</P>
<P>"Good, I don't want you shedding any more tears," she whispered as the tip of her tongue gently lifted the teardrops from Seven's lashes. "Is that understood?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded again, her heart pounding, she ached at their closeness, desperately wanting more.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's mouth travelled gently and oh, so slowly to the corner of Seven's mouth and placed a gentle, chaste kiss there, moved to the cleft in her chin and flicked her tongue at it. Seven couldn't help it, she moaned, sliding off the chair to be even closer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna needed Seven's closeness just as much, despite saying that they would take it slow, she wanted this, needed this. </P>
<P>Gently she took Seven's lower lip and sucked it softly, enjoying the softness, going out of her mind by the tiny whimpers coming from Seven. B'Elanna moved to the upper lip savouring every sensation.</P>
<P>Seven was gripping her by her shoulders, wanting more.</P>
<P>"Do you like that, baby?" B'Elanna teased softly, her tongue delving into the waiting mouth, caressing the soft, sweet tasting ...</P>

<P>Gently she took Seven's lower lip and sucked it softly, enjoying the softness, going out of her mind by the tiny whimpers coming from Seven. B'Elanna moved to the upper lip savouring every sensation.</P>
<P>Seven was gripping her by her shoulders, wanting more.</P>
<P>"Do you like that, baby?" B'Elanna teased softly, her tongue delving into the waiting mouth, caressing the soft, sweet tasting lips. She teased some more, her sharp white teeth gently nipping at Seven's full and pouty lower lip.</P>
<P>"Do you like it, honey?" B'Elanna breathed.</P>
<P>"Mmmm,"</P>
<P>Seven was a quick learner and she soon became the aggressor, wanting more from B'Elanna. Her mouth opened wider and she thrust her tongue deeper in to B'Elanna's mouth, their tongues duelling. Eventually they had to come up for air and even though B'Elanna's head was spinning, still she wanted more.</P>
<P>She began to drop tiny open-mouthed kisses along Seven's jaw and her neck. She trailed kisses along the beautiful slender throat until she found a spot that fascinated her. She could feel the blood rushing through Seven's veins at the pulse point and the knowledge that she caused this reaction was intoxicating.</P>
<P>All along B'Elanna had kept her hands to herself, but she decided to remedy that mistake straight away by slowly trailing her fingertips along Seven's ribcage. She stopped at her waist and slowly stroked them back, skimming the sides of the ex-drones breast. B'Elanna smiled as she heard the jagged breathing stop for a full minute.</P>
<P>Her mouth was still occupied by Seven's throat but she halted her ministrations for a second.</P>
<P>"Breathe, sweetheart, just breathe." </P>
<P>Seven was rapidly becoming unravelled, the very core of her being was molten hot and she didn't know long she could stand it. </P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at Seven, her eyes were heavy lidded and their colour was almost black, her soft lips were red and swollen and she was panting softly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's brain told her to stop while she still could but she wanted more, just a little more. Seven's nipples were clearly erect through her biosuit and begging for attention. B'Elanna happily obliged. She cupped one breast in her hand, massaging it softly and closed her hot mouth round the turgid nipple of the other.</P>
<P>Seven thought she'd died and gone to Stovokor. She thrust her hand into B'Elanna rich dark hair, holding her closer and panted out,</P>
<P>"I want your mouth on my skin. Now. You must comply."</P>
<P>B'Elanna sucked harder on the nipple, she could feel Seven trembling and knew that she was close. She also knew that Seven deserved much better than this. Rolling around on the floor wasn't good enough, she deserved a beautiful moonlit night, candles and silken sheets. Slowly she gentled her lover, and brought them both back down from the incredible heights they had just reached.</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, her hearts were pounding so loudly she could barely hear herself think. <I>If we are this good together fully clothed</I>, she shied away from the thought of the delights that truly making love to Seven would bring. <I>If I start thinking about that, I will never be able to sleep again. </I>B'Elanna pushed her hair out of her face with shaking hands. Seven was leaning back against the sofa, her eyes still heavy-lidded and sexy. She was also pouting.</P>
<P>"I do not wish to cease this activity."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled and leaned forward to place a gentle kiss on Seven's lips, but within seconds they were both burning again.</P>
<P>"We have got to stop," she dragged herself away and pulled Seven to her feet.</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven was less than amused.</P>
<P>"Because we need to take it slow. I've exposed you to a host of new emotions and you need time to be able to process them and live with them," </P>
<P>B'Elanna couldn't take her hands off Seven quite just yet, so she satisfied herself by holding, stroking Seven's borg-enhanced hand. She played with the palm, lightly tracing patterns on the soft, supple flesh until she realised that even that was turning them both on.</P>
<P>"This is going to be a nightmare," she muttered to herself.</P>
<P>Seven moved in close and rubbed herself up against the Klingon, "It does not have to be this way."</P>
<P>B'Elanna gulped and firmly moved the 6-foot amorous woman aside.</P>
<P>"Don't tell me you know how to be seductive as well as cute and vulnerable?" she saw the expression in Seven's eyes and quickly added.</P>
<P>"Don't even answer that." She looked around her quarters, there was no way that they could stay there without getting into a whole world of trouble so B'Elanna made a sensible, but boring decision.</P>
<P>"Go fix your hair and we can have breakfast together in the mess hall."</P>
<P>Seven pouted, she intuitively knew the effect it had on B'Elanna's heart rate.</P>
<P>"It would be more conducive to my wellbeing if we stayed here," she tried it on.</P>
<P>"Oh I'm sure," the Klingon smirked. She took Seven by the shoulders and turned her into the direction of the bedroom, swatting her lightly on the butt to help her along. </P>

<P>Maybe things were going to be all right.</P>
