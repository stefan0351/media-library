<p>Jessie glanced down at her hand, which was being firmly
held by Katie's, as they made their way down the hallway to her apartment. Katie had
been distracted by something in the lobby and had missed the elevator arriving and turned
around just in time to grasp Jessie's hand and have the other woman pull her in.
After that she hadn't let go, and Jessie hadn't said anything about it.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose this is where I say goodnight and
sleep tight," Katie said as they came to a stop in front of a door, regretfully
letting go of Jessie's hand.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come in," Jessie said keying
her code into the small box by the door. "For a nightcap."</p>

<p>"You can mix drinks too?" Katie asked, trying to
hide her surprise at actually being invited in. After the first night they had met up, she
hadn't even been sure if her offer to drop Jessie off at her building would've
been accepted.</p>

<p>"I was thinking more along the lines of coffee,"
Jessie said with a smile as she stepped inside. "Welcome to my humble abode."</p>

<p>"It's certainly a nice abode," Katie said as
Jessie called for the lights. "But not so much humble," she continued handing
her coat to Jessie. "You've got a lovely home."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Jessie said, pleased that Katie was
pleased. "Give me a minute to put a pot on and I'll give you the tour."</p>

<p>"Done," Katie said walking into the living room.</p>

<p>Jessie leaned forward slowly closing the distance between
them before bringing their lips together, her eyes fluttering closed at the first contact
of their lips. She remembered these lips, their taste, their feel, and she got a reminder
in the miraculous power they had to turn her entire body into a pile of gelatinous mush as
Katie leaned forward increasing the contact the between, drawing Jessie onto her lap.</p>

<p>Jessie moaned slightly, her hands coming to rest at the
side of Katie's face, holding her head steady as she deepened the kiss, pressing
forward as she felt Katie's hands come to rest on her waist.</p>

<p>"You should go," Jessie said when the need for
oxygen finally pulled them apart.</p>

<p>"But you," Katie started to say looking more than
a little confused.</p>

<p>"I know," Jessie replied slipping back onto the
couch. "But still."</p>

<p>"Okay," Katie said looking as confused as ever
but standing up to go nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Katie," Jessie said standing up along with her,
carefully studying the other woman.</p>

<p>"Yes," Katie replied tentatively, having lost the
grip she had on whatever was happening tonight, and not wanting to screw up any progress
they may have made.</p>

<p>"Why do you put up with my shit?" Jessie asked
her tone slightly awed.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that you've lost me," Katie
commented. "That wasn't Irish coffee was it?"</p>

<p>"With my reaction to the letter, and to going to the
dance, and to Sarah, and you going overseas, and..." Jessie said rambling off
incidents were her behavior had been confounding to her, and even more so for Katie, but
which the other woman had just accepted in stride, most of the time not even batting an
eyelash at her nonsensical reactions.</p>

<p>"I get it," Katie said halting the trail of words
coming out of her mouth. "And the answer, cheesy as it may sound, is because
you're worth it. I mean I know I have my own personality quirks," she continued,
quickly adding, "and please don't take that as an opportunity to list them all.
So, even though I sometimes found, find, your behavior incomprehensible," she went on
smiling a bit, "I'm really okay with it."</p>

<p>Jessie stepped forward, her eyes holding Katie's as
she closed the distance between them, and then she brought their lips together once more,
gently exploring Katie's mouth, with a tender leisureliness she hadn't
experienced since high school.</p>

<p>"I'm going," Katie said when they pulled
part. "I'm going. Will I see you tomorrow?" she asked hovering by the door.</p>

<p>"You didn't check your mail before we left did
you?" Jessie asked smiling. She was in the know about something.</p>

<p>"No," Katie responded wondering what Jessie was
in the know about.</p>

<p>"Well, then whether you see me or not is entirely up
to you," she replied. "Drive..."</p>

<p>"Safely, I know," Katie replied.
"You're worse than my mother," and with that she was gone.</p>

<p>Jessie sighed shaking her head thinking that the situation
was even more complicated than it was in high school and not knowing how that could be at
all possible considering the den of complexity their relationship had been back then. Then
she smiled, because she was never so happy to have absolutely no idea what was going on.</p>
