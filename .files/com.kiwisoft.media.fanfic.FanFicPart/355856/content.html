<!-- The Grrls Club \ Chapter Two: What To Do Now? -->

<p><u>Jennifer and Megan Delaney's quarters</u></p>
		<p>Three holovids and three late 20th century movies later the living quarters looked like a Maquis bomb had gone off. The television top had one bunny and one teddy bear slipper in a compromising position. Strewn around the room were remnants of popcorn, candy wrappers and six empty champagne bottles. In the middle of the room in a rough circle were ten very giggly and loud grrls</p>
		<p>"I don't wont to be a chicken pie" said Cha'Hal in a mock British accent </p>
		<p>That sent the room into riotous laughter.</p>
		<p>"More power to the engines!" screamed Kathryn in a worse British accent than Cha'Hal.</p>
		<p>This caused B'Elanna to squirt champagne out of her nose, coughing and spluttering "See ALL the bloody captains are the same, more power, MORE POWER!!!"</p>
		<p>This time it was Tarzi and Kathryn that lost their champagne through their noses.</p>
		<p>"Please explain. Why would the 20th century people want their chickens to communicate when they were going to turn them into pies?" Seven did not understand why a simple question had all nine other grrls rolling around on the floor laughing so much.</p>
		<p>" Quick let me up Cha'Hal, I am going to pee my pants" giggled a very drunk Shelly. She struggled to free herself from her lovers' arms and ran to the biowaste unit.</p>
		<p>"Ok what are we going to do now?" giggled Megan</p>
		<p>"Bottles! we could play bottles" imputed Jennifer.</p>
		<p>"What'sthat" Slurred Samantha</p>
		<p>"It's a sculling game" answered Kathryn</p>
		<p>"How do you know about sculling games Kathryn?" asked Tarzi in a mock shocked voice.</p>
		<p>Kathryn looked Tarzi in the eyes, pointed her finger and said, "I'll have you know `hic' I was an Ensign once and besides it was the first sculling game I was taught `hic'"</p>
		<p>"It will be my first too" piped up Seven proudly. </p>
		<p>"So how do we play this game of bottles?" queried B'Elanna. Susan proceeded to instruct everyone on the game.</p>
		<p>As Shelly came out of the biowaste unit Cha'Hal asked her to replicate a bottle of tequila.</p>
		<p>"Well you have to have the RIGHT sculling liquid" winked Cha'Hal, well she tried to anyway.</p>
		<p>"We cant let this go to waste" Samantha swirled around a ¼ filled bottle of champagne.</p>
		<p>"Oh that wont go to waste. Lets all have a tequila slammer before we start." Smirked Susan.</p>
		<p>She got up and replicated everyone her own shot-glass and ½ filled them all with tequila.</p>
		<p>"What's a tequila slammer?" asked Tarzi.</p>
		<p>"Well" Susan stared to explain " You take this ½ shot of tequila and you add ½ champagne. Then you put your hand over the top. Then you slam it down making the bubbles of champagne go through the tequila, then you scull it quickly in one hit"</p>
		<p>Susan then proceeded to show everyone the Nicoletti Slammer. B'Elanna, Kathryn, Tarzi, Cha'Hal, Shelly, Samantha, Megan then Jennifer all followed suit.</p>
		<p>Seven just stood there with her glass in her hand looking a bit apprehensive like the drink was going to bite her.</p>
		<p>"Gee Seven I don't think its going to bite you. Go on its fun" smiled B'Elanna</p>
		<p>Seven thought that her cortical implant was going to explode from that beautiful smile, resistance is futile.</p>
		<p>"Ok I will try the drink" Seven smiled as she proceeded to slam the drink down.</p>
		<p>"Quickly I am malfunctioning, get them out B'Elanna!" Panicked Seven Everybody rushed closer to see what the problem was.</p>
		<p>"What out Seven?" from where B'Elanna stood she couldn't see anything. Seven lifted her face and showed B'Elanna up her nose. "Those bubbles"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna laughed so hard that she fell backwards onto a pile of cushions taking Seven with her.</p>
		<p>Still laughing Kathryn looked over at the failing arms and legs, hands and feet. Two heads bobbed up from the mess.</p>
		<p>Tarzi grabbed the holocamera and laughed "This is just so perfect. They look like two teenagers who were sprung by their parents" She waggled her eyebrows suggestively</p>
		<p>B'Elanna hoped it didn't show but she felt like a teenager with raging hormones, who had just got caught by her parents. God Seven feels so good.</p>
		<p>As Seven tried to untangle herself from B'Elanna she grabbed her breast.</p>
		<p>"Way to go Seven, nice way to grab a free booby grope" chuffed Cha'Hal Seven blushed.</p>
		<p>"Cha'Hal!" Michelle punched Cha'Hal in mock disgust.</p>
		<p>" Well it was" piped up Samantha. Shit thought Sam I did say that out loud.</p>
		<p>Everyone turned to the now red Samantha. They all burst out laughing even B'Elanna and Seven.</p>
		<p>"Ok less booby groping. Its time to play bottles" yelled Megan. B'Elanna and Seven successfully untangled themselves. Every grabbed their shot-glasses and sat or laid around in a circle.</p>
		<p>" Ok I think I am completely dunk, What's next" Hiccupped one very drunk Starfleet Captain.</p>
		<p>She shook the empty bottle of tequila for effect.</p>
		<p>The ten of them had finished the bottle off with 1 game of bottles, 1 of grab the queen of heart and bunnies to the right. All of which were Starfleet Academy drinking games that Kathryn had remembered so well.</p>
		<p>"Lets play Truth and Dare!" piped up Cha'Hal then added, " anything goes."</p>
		<p>"Trust YOU to think of that one Cha'Hal" Laughed B'Elanna "I am in"</p>
		<p>Echo's of yep I'm In and me too's were giggled or hiccupped or laughed across the room. Even Kathryn after a little rib tickling and teasing of `scaredy cat' from Samantha, was in.</p>
		<p>Every one except Seven.</p>
		<p>"What is this anything goes truth or dare?" Seven tried to hold back a very human burp but failed.</p>
		<p>"You'll see Seven, you'll see" smirked B'Elanna with a very naughty wicked gleam in her eye.</p>
		<p>"Ok I am in. Will I enjoy the experience B'Elanna?" smiled Seven</p>
		<p>"OH I am sure you will Seven"</p>
