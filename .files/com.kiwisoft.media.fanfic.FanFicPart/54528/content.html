<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Four -->

<p>Finally she stirred. An agonizing week and a half after the accident, Brooke finally regained consciousness. Mike, Jane and Sam were present when her hazel eyes flickered open and then eventually stayed open to observe the room in which she now found herself. Confusion marred her features as she took in the stark whiteness of her hospital room. Her gaze wandered to her father and the relief evident on his face before her focus flittered to Jane and the woman's wide smile. Finally, her eyes came to rest on Sam and the gentle smile on the brunette's face. </p>
<p>"Hey," Sam said. </p>
<p>"Hey," Brooke rasped with a deep frown. </p>
<p>"How ya feeling?" Sam asked just wanting to hear more of Brooke's badly missed voice. </p>
<p>"My head hurts," Brooke answered honestly. Sam laughed slightly. </p>
<p>"That's what you get when you wrap your car around a tree, silly," Sam joked. Brooke's brow wrinkled as she nodded. </p>
<p>"I see," she said. "Can I ask you something?" </p>
<p>"Sure," Sam chirped. </p>
<p>"Who the heck ARE you people?" she asked innocently. And with that simple and befuddled question, the McPherson-McQueen household shattered into a million pieces like a glass house collapsing. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Several days, many hours and an alarming number of doctors later, she was sure of a few things: </p>
<p>1) Her head hurt like Hell
<br>2) Her name was Brooke McQueen, or so she'd been told
<br>3) She apparently was a poor driver; and
<br>4) These people, except one or two, were really beginning to annoy her</p>
<p><br>Brooke let out a heavy sigh and stared at the unfamiliar faces before her. As explained to her by the cute brunette, Sam, one was her father Mike, one was her stepmother Jane, again there was Sam, and then there was the boyfriend Harrison. Except for Sam, Brooke was really tired of the other three. She was feeling suffoctaed by their overbearing sweetness. They kept treating her like she was stupid while Sam just treated her normally. And she was was grateful for that.</p>
<p>"Look I really appreciate that you're trying to help but I'm tired. Could you leave me alone?" she asked. All four individuals blinked in surprise at the request but got up to leave. </p>
<p>"Sure honey," Mike said as he hugged her. Brooke felt uncomfortable hugging the stranger but relented. </p>
<p>"Yeah, we'll see you later, Brooke," Sam said. Fear at suddenly being left all alone raced through Brooke. </p>
<p>"You can stay, Sam," she said hastily. Sam jumped in surprise and Brooke caught the downright evil look Harrison directed at Sam. It confused the Hell out of her. But then, confusion seemed to be her permanent state of mind lately.</p>
<p>"Sure, Brooke, I'd love to," Sam said happily as she retook her seat and shot a somewhat triumphant look at Harrison as the doors shut behind him. An awkward silence stretched for a few minutes before Brooke broke it. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry Sam, but they were really starting to annoy me," she pointed out sheepishly. Sam looked at her and arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Mom, Mike, and Harrison? Don't worry, that's normal," Sam smirked. Brooke smiled back at her. To her, Sam may be a stranger but she was the only person around whom Brooke felt comfortable. </p>
<p>"Well, that's a relief," she quipped. She watched as Sam's expression turned concerned a few minutes later. </p>
<p>"Seriously, Brooke, I know you must hate this question by now, but how are you doing?" The genuine warmth and caring in Sam's voice took any sting of annoyance out of the question. </p>
<p>"OK, I guess. Incredibly confused," she confessed. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"That's understandable. What about though? Because I'm more than willing to help you out if you want me to," she offered. The offer made Brooke feel a little better. </p>
<p>"Thanks. Don't worry about it though. I think I'm getting it now. The little Spanish girl, oh damn, what's her name," Brooke faltered as she searched her new memory for the name. She looked at Sam. </p>
<p>"You know, the little one with the big head?" she said. Sam burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"Lily," she supplied between giggles. Brooke smiled and nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, Lily, thank you. By the way, she really should eat something. It can't be healthy for someone to be that thin," she remarked. Sam started laughing harder at the observation. Brooke found that it was a sound that she really enjoyed hearing. </p>
<p>"Anyway, Lily did this diagram thing on a computer. Complete with pictures of who everyone was and how they factor in my life," she explained. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"How helpful," she said dryly. Brooke snickered. </p>
<p>"She means well. But really, how would you like someone handing you your life in a neatly bound book?" Sam crinkled her nose. "Yeah, my point exactly." </p>
<p>"And on top of that, her friend, the other one," she snapped her fingers as she once again found herself at a loss for a name. </p>
<p>"Damn, was I always this bad with names?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No. But don't worry about it. Some of it will eventually stick in that brain of yours. You're not stupid," Sam said simply. </p>
<p>"See? That's why I like talking to you. You don't make me feel like a brain damaged reject," Brooke told her. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Cuz you aren't one. But you were saying?" </p>
<p>"Oh yeah. Lily's friend, the heavy girl who's perpetually nervous. You know, like she's afraid she's going to get caught doing something only she's not sure what. Only that she's going to get caught." She watched as Sam dissolved into a fresh giggle fit. </p>
<p>"Carmen," Sam gasped when she recovered. "Your descriptions of our friends are viciously accurate, you know." Brooke grinned sheepishly. </p>
<p>"Sorry, but I don't know anyone well enough to really care much about hurting their feelings. I call them as I see them," she explained. </p>
<p>"So noted. God, I'd hate to hear what you think about me," Sam commented. Before Brooke could respond, Sam continued speaking. "What did Carmen do?" Deciding to let the subject of what she thought of Sam drop, Brooke reached over onto her bedtable and pulled out a stack of cards. </p>
<p>"She gave me these," Brooke said handing them over. On one side of the card was someone's color headshot while on the other was their name and a brief bio.</p>
<p>"FLASHCARDS?" Sam asked unbelieving. "Oh those two are just too much," she chuckled. </p>
<p>"That's for sure," Brooke agreed lightly. They fell back into a compatable silence that found Sam deep in thought and Brooke studying her. She didn't know why she found Sam so fascinating. But there was something about Sam that made Brooke feel safe. And there was something about Sam's warm brown eyes that drew her in until she thought she'd drown. Those eyes were so pained and haunted that despite Sam's tough exterior they gave her a wounded aura. Brooke wanted to know why Sam was like that. She doubted that she really knew why even before the accident. The more time she spent with Sam, the more she wanted to get to know her. </p>
<p>"Tell me about you," she said suddenly, breaking Sam from whatever thought she was in the middle of. Sam looked at her quizzically. </p>
<p>"Why? You wanna be bored back into a coma?" she joked. Brooke scowled at her.</p>
<p>"No, I want to get to know you," she responded firmly. </p>
<p>"Brooke," Sam sighed. "There's nothing to know. I'm your friend and former worst enemy. I'm going to be your stepsister, I'm a writer, and I'm an all around pain in your ass." </p>
<p>"And you're normally this difficult?" Sam gave her a lopsided grin. </p>
<p>"Yes, actually. And I'm not even trying that hard," she joked. </p>
<p>"You shouldn't try at all, Sam. I just want to get to know you," Brooke said softly. </p>
<p>"You are, Brooke. This is me, no great mystery. What you see is what you get. The more you talk to me, the more you'll see that," Sam explained. </p>
<p>"I don't think that's the truth," Brooke protested. Sam frowned at her. </p>
<p>"Why not?" </p>
<p>"I may be mentally damaged right now, Sam, but I know there's more to you than meets the eye. But if you're uncomfortable with telling me more about yourself, fine. I understand. No pressure. You're a stranger to me and let's face it, I'm one to you too." Sam shrugged and stayed silent. </p>
<p>"So I guess all I can say is we'll get to know each other as we go along," Brooke suggested. Sam gave her a small shy smile. </p>
<p>"Works for me."</p>
