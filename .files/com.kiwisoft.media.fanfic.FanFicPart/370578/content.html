<p><i><b>A/N: Boy oh boy, this is tedious to type up...somehow I lost all the files on my computer for this story, so it's completely on the system. Here's the next chapter...hopefully I will get chapter 9 up quicker. Thanks for the lovely reviews, as always.</b></i><hr size=1 noshade></p>
<p>On the stroke of four, Miley reached into the upper bunk and shook Lilly. "Departure time," she whispered.</p>
<p>With a low moan Lilly jumped down and began struggling into her clothes. She mumbled, "I'm sure my outlook on Alcatraz would be much less severe if only I could get some sleep."</p>
<p>"Pretty soon you won't need an outlook on Alcatraz at all," Miley whispered back. "It'll all be nothing but an unpleasant memory. Ready?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded. "Let's go."</p>
<p>They tiptoed towards the door and were just reaching for the doorknob when each was suddenly seized by her belt and hauled backwards into the counselor's room.</p>
<p>Trina, her face flaming with anger, shut her door and turned on them. "<i>Stewart!"</i> Although the counselor was whispering, it sounded like shouting. "Where do you think you're going?"</p>
<p>"The dock, the mainland, and then home," Miley replied calmly.</p>
<p>"What kind of a girl are you, Stewart?" Trina fumed. I heard you promise Ms. Warden that you wouldn't take a boat without permission!"</p>
<p>"That's right, and I won't. But last night I asked Lilly if I could take a boat and she said yes. So I have permission. And I gave her my permission to come along with me."</p>
<p>"<i>What?"</i> Trina was no longer whispering. "Don't you bandy words with me! You know darn well Ms. Warden meant official permission!"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Miley, poker-faced. "It's a good thing you stopped us then. Old Elias would have been annoyed."</p>
<p>Lilly snickered and, amazingly, so did Trina. But the counselor's amusement soon passed. "Get back into bed, Stewart! And you too, Truscott! And another two days work detail for each of you! Now move!" She opened her door and pushed them out into the campers' section of the cabin.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" came a sleepy voice from an upper bunk.</p>
<p>"What are you doing up?" bellowed Trina. "Go to sleep, all of you!"</p>
<p>The last sound Miley heard before she drifted off was Lilly laughing into her pillow.</p>
<p>"Hey," said Trina, looking around table 13 at breakfast, "where are Stewart and Truscott?"</p>
<p>"Who cares?" sneered Ashley.</p>
<p>"The last I saw," said Sarah, "they were down at the dock watching them load empty cartons on the supply boat."</p>
<p>With a scream of protest Trina jumped up, overturning the bench and sending five girls sprawling. "The supply boat? <i>Oh, no!"</i></p>
<p>She tore out of the dining hall like a madwoman and thundered across the compound, shouting "<i>Stop!"</i> all the way. As her feet pounded onto the wood of the dock, a horrible sight met her eyes. There stood Marina, clipboard in hand, waving goodbye to the supply boat as it pulled away. "No! Stop it! Come back!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Trina?" asked Marina, bewildered. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Marina watched in horror as Trina hurled herself off the dock and began swimming madly after the boat. "Stop! Come back!"</p>
<p>"Stop!" shouted Marina. She wasn't sure why.</p>
<p>Lauren came running up from the nearby swimming dock. "What's the matter? What's Trina doing?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." Marina shrugged. "She's trying to catch the supply boat for some reason."</p>
<p>Lauren laughed. "Look at her floundering around out there! If she wanted to catch that boat, she should have sent Stewart!"</p>
<p>"Stewart! That's it!" Marina exclaimed. "Stewart must be on that boat!" She ran to the end of the dock and jumped into a small motor boat. The little craft roared out after the supply boat, and with its superior speed, cut in front of it. Marina waved the driver back to the dock, then pulled up beside Trina and hauled her aboard. They roared back to the dock.</p>
<p>Trina jumped from one boat to the other. "<i>Stewart!"</i> she howled, her eyes searching the stacked cartons. "You come out right now!" Arms flailing, she knocked over a large corrugated carton in the stern. There sat Miley and Lilly, blinking in the sudden sunlight. Trina loomed over them, furious and dripping wet.</p>
<p>"Oh, hi," said Miley genially. "Has it been raining?"</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart!</i> What are you two doing here?"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you'd believe me if I said we were being kidnapped," suggested Miley.</p>
<p>"All right, Stewart!" said Trina through clenched teeth. "You're going to pay for this!"</p>
<p>"Work detail?" asked Miley.</p>
<p>"<i>Work detail!"</i> bellowed Trina. "Five more days! And kitchen duty! Today and tomorrow! Now get off this boat! <i>Move!"</i></p>
<p>As Trina was quick-marching Miley and Lilly off the boat towards the dining hall, Marina was running along beside her.</p>
<p>"Don't you think you're being a little hard on them?" she asked in an undertone. "I mean, if you've been punishing them a lot, maybe that's why they want to run away."</p>
<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Trina. "If this keeps up, the next person running away from here will be <i>me!</i>"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose she'd be willing to give us that in writing," Miley commented to Lilly.</p>
<p>"Can it, Stewart!" snapped Trina. "Now both of you—get in there and grab some breakfast. And when you're finished, report to the kitchen. The staff will put you to work." She turned to Marina. "Maybe a little potato peeling will show her who's boss around here!"</p>
<p>"Why," said Miley, scraping the abundant leftovers from a stack of plates, "don't they just take our food and throw it straight into the garbage? That would eliminate the middle man."</p>
<p>"That's enough out of you," growled the chief cook. "Keep working. The sooner you finish the work, the sooner you get out to join your cabin and have some fun."</p>
<p>Miley looked at Lilly. "We're in no hurry," she said.</p>
<p>"Well, we are," said another cook. "We're not going to stay here overtime on your account. We work hard, you know. It's not easy cooking for a bunch of kids who don't like anything."</p>
<p>"Maybe they'd like something if everything didn't look and taste like putty," commented Miley mildly.</p>
<p>"Well, if you don't like it," howled the chief cook, "why don't you just take a boat and leave?"</p>
<p>Instantly Miley began to scrape and stack dishes with model efficiency. Taking her cue from Miley, although she wasn't quite sure why, Lilly too began to work quickly. In five minutes they were finished. Miley grabbed Lilly by the arm and began dragging her across the compound towards the dock.</p>
<p>"Hey!" protested Lilly. "Where are we going?"</p>
<p>"You heard the woman," said Miley. "She distinctly said we should take a boat and leave."</p>
<p>"But we can't!" cried Lilly. "We promised not to take any more boats!"</p>
<p>"Without official permission," Miley added. "But now we have official permission—from the chief cook herself."</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>"Well, is it or is it not official permission?" Miley asked defiantly.</p>
<p>"I don't know—" Lilly began.</p>
<p>""Well," Miley interrupted, "suit yourself. I'm going." She continued to run towards the dock.</p>
<p>"But they'll see us! They'll catch us!" Lilly protested, keeping pace.</p>
<p>"Maybe," said Miley. "And maybe not. There must be a dozen girls out there in boats. Maybe they won't notice us."</p>
<p>The two jumped into a motor boat. Miley was just casting off when they heard the sound of running feet, and a familiar voice howled, "<i>Stewart! You come back here!"</i></p>
<p>Trina caught the mooring line just as the motor roared into action and the boat tore away from the dock. With a terrified howl the counselor, still clutching the rope, flew in a three-foot arc through the air before belly-flopping with a huge splash into the water.</p>
<p>Miley gunned the boat to full speed.</p>
<p>"Miley, stop!" screamed Lilly. "She's still back there! We're towing her!"</p>
<p>Miley glanced quickly behind them. There was Trina, kicking up a spray like a cabin cruiser. Instantly she cut the motor. "That," she said in disgust, "is the only clone in the world who can water-ski on her face."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do?" gibbered Lilly. "She's going to kill us!"</p>
<p>Trina swam up to the edge of the boat and climbed on board. "Take it back to the dock," she gasped. "Now!"</p>
<p>Obediently Miley turned the boat around, steered it up to the dock and threw the rope to Marina, who had witnessed the incident and was grimly waiting.</p>
<p>"What's all this?" shouted the head counselor.</p>
<p>"When Trina fell in the lake," explained Miley, "we stopped our boat and came back to pick her up." It was, in essence, the truth, with a few important points left out.</p>
<p>Trina threw back her head and emitted a horrible roar. "You saw what happened!" she screamed at Marina.</p>
<p>"So did I," said Miley. "Your take-off was great, but your landing was a little rough."</p>
<p>"Shut up, Stewart!" cried Trina. "You're in big trouble now! You promised Ms. Warden and you promised me not to take a boat without permission!"</p>
<p>"I <i>had</i> permission," said Miley earnestly. "Official permission."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" snarled Trina. "Who from?"</p>
<p>"The chief cook. She said if we didn't like it here we should take a boat and leave. And we don't like it here, so we took a boat and left. At least, we tried to." She eyed Trina accusingly.</p>
<p>"That's it, Stewart! <i>That's it!</i> You know darn well that wasn't permission to take off. Nobody gets permission to take off. You are stuck here, Stewart! Here! And me with you! You can either try to make the best of it and maybe have some fun, or you can be an idiot." She paused, gasping for breath. "We are not going to force you to play anything. You can sit around and <i>rot</i> for all we care. But you're staying put. Understood?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Miley, her face expressionless.</p>
<p>"And that goes double for you, Truscott. You should know better than to follow Stewart around. She's just getting you into trouble. Now both of you—five more days work detail. And two more kitchen duty. Right now you go back to the bunk. You're confined there until lunch."</p>
<p>Miley and Lilly scampered away in the direction of Cabin 13.</p>
<p>"Wow," exclaimed Lilly as they threw open the door and rushed inside, "was she ever mad!"</p>
<p>Miley draped herself across her bunk. "This is Camp Algonkian Island," she recited. "It was founded thirty-one years ago by Elias Warden, Bow Legs the First. It is presently under the regime of Bow Legs the Third. Never before, until today, has a clone flown that far or that high without permission."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed. "Don't you mean official permission?"</p>
<p>"Official permission," Miley amended. "How about a little chess?"</p>
<p>"Chess? Doesn't anything bother you?" asked Lilly, still shaking from the events of the morning.</p>
<p>"No," said Miley flatly.</p>
<p>They were just setting up the board when Trina, glowering like an avenging angel, appeared in the doorway. "All right, you two—get over to the kitchen. You're to help prepare and serve lunch. Move!" She disappeared.</p>
<p>Miley put the chess board aside and went over to Ashley's suitcase. She reached inside and brought out a single white sock.</p>
<p>"What's that for?" asked Lilly suspiciously.</p>
<p>"We're to help prepare lunch," explained Miley. "I thought this would add a little flavor to the soup."</p>
<p>"Hold out your plate," said Miley patiently from behind the lunch counter. "I'm not Mrs. Incredible, you know." She slopped a generous portion of beef stew onto the first plate. "Next."</p>
<p>Farther up the counter Lilly, her white apron spattered with green, was serving pea soup. Her eyes darted nervously into each bowlful that she ladled out.</p>
<p>Along came Cabin 13 in the line. The girls self-consciously ignored Miley and Lilly, all except Ashley, who snickered and sneered at both of them.</p>
<p>"Well, Stewart," said Trina, smiling broadly, "how do you like serving the food?"</p>
<p>"A lot better than I like eating it."</p>
<p>"Hey, you," snapped one of the cooks from the kitchen, "I don't want to hear any more cracks about the food!"</p>
<p>"We'll have to whisper from now on," said Miley confidentially to Lilly.</p>
<p>This time Lilly did not laugh. She had turned deathly white. As the last few girls filed by, she leaned over to Miley. "Miley, we've got to get out of here!"</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Miley, about to fill two plates of stew for herself and Lilly.</p>
<p>"The sock!" gasped Lilly in a high-pitched wheeze. "Trina got it! It went into Trina's bowl!"</p>
<p>Faint indications of a smile played about the corners of Miley's mouth. "Fate," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Let's get out of here!" Lilly repeated.</p>
<p>"We can't," said Miley. "We have orders to sit down and eat lunch with our bunk under our clone's watchful eye."</p>
<p>"But, Miley—"</p>
<p>"And I don't want any soup, thank you."</p>
<p>Lilly had to laugh. "Neither do I!"</p>
<p>They sat down at table 13 and began to eat.</p>
<p>Trina, who was a hearty eater, dipped her spoon vigorously into the soup. Her eyes bulged as she came up with a long, green, dripping sweat sock.</p>
<p>"Hey! What's this?"</p>
<p>Still holding the spoon half an inch from her mouth, Trina surveyed table 13. "All right, who did it?"</p>
<p>Miley looked up innocently. "Did what?"</p>
<p>"<i>Who put this sock in my soup?"</i></p>
<p>There was dead silence.</p>
<p>"Well," suggested Miley helpfully, "why don't you look at the label and see who it belongs to?"</p>
<p>Gingerly Trina wrung the soup out of the sock and turned the cuff inside-out. "Ashley," she read. "Ashley, you did this!"</p>
<p>"I didn't!" squeaked Ashley. "Honest!"</p>
<p>Trina looked down the table to where Lilly was sitting, red as a beet, and Miley was passively eating her stew. "Stewart! <i>You</i> did it!"</p>
<p>"It was Stewart! It was Stewart!" piped Ashley.</p>
<p>Miley put down her fork and heaved a sigh. "Caught again."</p>
<p>Marina came over to table 13. "Trina, what's this about a dirty sock in the soup?"</p>
<p>"Clean sock," Miley amended. "The food around here is bad enough without having to worry about dirt."</p>
<p>"That's enough out of you!" came a shout from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Putting stuff in the food is very serious," said Marina. "We'd better take her to Ms. Warden."</p>
<p>"Marvelous," said Miley evenly. "I haven't heard about old Elias for a whole day."</p>
<p>Marina and Trina looked at each other and grinned, but their amusement died as abruptly as it had been born.</p>
<p>"Never mind Ms. Warden," said Trina. "I can handle this. Stewart, you're confined to the cabin for the rest of the day except for kitchen duty at supper and work detail. You too, Truscott. You were in on this."</p>
<p>Miley shook her head sadly. "And all because I wanted to improve the taste of the soup."</p>
<p>"You shut up!" came another voice from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"And," said Trina, "that'll be another two days work detail for each of you."</p>
<p>"And she should have to wash my sock," put in Ashley savagely.</p>
<p>"I don't do laundry," said Miley.</p>
<p>"So," said Trina, sitting down wearily at the counselors' meeting that evening, "they spend all day in the cabin, which is all they want to do anyway."</p>
<p>"That kid Stewart," said Marina, shaking her head. "I just can't figure her out."</p>
<p>"Well, I know one thing," said Trina with conviction. "We can't let her out of our sight. Three times they were caught trying to run away today! Three times! And I'm sure she hasn't given up yet. One of us has to be with her at all times. And Truscott is just as bad when she's with Stewart, which is all the time."</p>
<p>"Hey," suggested Kitty, "why don't we separate them?"</p>
<p>"That's a great idea," said Marina. "Without Stewart, Truscott won't be any trouble at all."</p>
<p>"Without Stewart," said Trina dreamily. "What a beautiful thought! But it can't be done. Stewart and Truscott like each other, and nobody else in camp can stand either one of them."</p>
<p>"Besides," nodded Marina in reluctant agreement, "they may not like it here, but it's still our job to see that they hate it the least."</p>
<p>The meeting was interrupted by the stormy entrance of the chief cook. "All right," she demanded, "which one of you is the keeper of that girl Stewart?"</p>
<p>"I am," admitted Trina sadly.</p>
<p>A piece of paper was thrust under her nose. Trina began to read: <i>"We the undersigned refuse to work in the Algonkian kitchen if Stewart is going to be there."</i></p>
<p>"It's been signed by every member of the kitchen staff," pointed out the cook.</p>
<p>Trina sighed. "What exactly has she done?"</p>
<p>"She puts down the food all the time."</p>
<p>"Come off it," scoffed Marina. "You guys have worked in a camp long enough to have learned to ignore wisecracks about the food."</p>
<p>"I understand," put in Trina. "When it's Stewart it's different. She's so—so <i>good</i> at it. I'd better take her and Truscott off kitchen duty before we have a revolution."</p>
<p>"Oh, we don't mind Truscott," said the cook. "Mind you, she laughs at all Stewart's jokes—better take them both off. We'd sure appreciate it."</p>
<p>"That's okay," said Trina. "The only problem is that I've run out of ways to punish them. Anybody got any ideas?"</p>
<p>"How about putting them on work detail?" suggested Ruby.</p>
<p>"I've lost count of their work details," admitted Trina. "For all I know they're on until Christmas!" She rested her chin on her palm. "Anyway, we've got to keep an eye on Stewart. They said they're going to arts and crafts tomorrow right after breakfast. I'll see that they get there. Then it's up to you, Chantel."</p>
<p>"What," asked Chantel, "have I done to deserve that?"</p>
<p>"Just watch them," said Trina. "You're in charge of them until lunch."</p>
<p>The beaver was satisfied. The humans had been quiet today, and he had been able to accomplish a great deal of work on the dam. It was really taking shape now. He hoped he would have many more productive days like this one.</p>
