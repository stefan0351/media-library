<!-- Longing With a Cherry Tomato on Top \ Chapter 7: Connecting the Dots, Step by Step - Part 1 -->

<h4>Paris' POV, 6:10am</h4>
<p>I arrived in the makeshift parking lot of Stars Hollow High School
around 5:45am, guiding my Jag effortlessly around the traffic cones and
over the curb as I passed the fence surrounding the field and a couple
volunteers guiding me towards my space with orange safety sticks. Since
Stars Hollow is basically what the board of education would usually call
a 'walking and school bus district', there had never been a need for a
big parking lot, there was just enough asphalt for the faculty and the
few students with their own cars to pull onto. But with the dance
marathon, there were some relatives of town citizens coming in along
with spectators, so they opened up the athletic field in back for
parking. </p>
<p>Where at Chilton I'm thankful that I have a close spot near the door
thanks to my position, my poor car that morning was going to be stuck
among the Civics, Escorts, Sonatas and Envoys of the world. I was guided
slowly to my space by the safety stick people, driving behind a brown
pickup I swore had to be used to haul pig waste at one time. I kept
myself calm though, listening to the 40s channel on my XM radio and
trying to get into a time warp mood where it was 1943 and I was driving
in a smooth and classy Studebaker roadster instead. </p>
<p>Of course, this being Stars Hollow, no one cared if I drove into the
place in a 1978 Dodge Aspen, so my parking space, instead of on solid
asphalt, ended up on the fringe of the baseball diamond's infield. When
I stepped out, the heel of my shoe had to dodge the socket hole where
second base would usually rest, and I stepped right onto hard, compacted
dirt. </p>
<p>I was thinking seriously about complaining about my space to the
attendant, but then I remembered who I was here for; Rory, who would
probably admonish me if I went back to my sophomore year behavior and
whined about 'small-town yokels', and that her town was very comparable
to some places in North Dakota long left behind by the young. It really
wasn't that bad of a town; I've just been so used to the cosmopolitan
urban atmosphere where I've been raised. Summers in the Hamptons, winter
breaks down in Florida, and spring vacations spent up in my daddy's
brownstone close to Harvard where I built up my relationships with the
school's faculty and admissions staff. This was just another
interesting stop on the journey that has been my life. </p>
<p>I had on my jacket over my dress so those who were walking towards
the building with me couldn't comment, and they were regarding me with
little interest. Most of them were in the same 40's garb, with a few
teens and adults here and there being anachronistic and in modern
dresses and slacks. There was even one boy who thought that James Dean
may have perfected his look on December 31st of 1949 and was trying to
pass it off as correct for the time period. I wanted to call a few of
those people out, but that might have been a little rude, considering I
wasn't even related to anyone in this town. </p>
<p>When I walked into the small high school, I could start to feel my
anticipation build up for what was to happen. The hallways were small,
lockers perfectly lined up, clusters of 35 broken up by the occasional
classroom or closet door, followed by 35 more lockers. The look of the
building definitely said 'Hollywood small-town high school' all over,
down to the ornate ceilings above with the old style frosted glass light
fixtures hanging from the rafters. </p>
<p>I saw a sign directing all of us towards check-in and coat check,
and had the information Rory had sent me last night about it in a text
message on my cell phone. We were couple #131 according to the contest
order, so I lined up with everyone else and waited patiently to check
in, the foyer in front of the gymnasium packed with people. </p>
<p>I searched around the room, and squinted my eyes out towards the
front courtyard of the school looking for Rory through the doors, but I
couldn't seem to place her, since she wasn't the only one wearing a red
polka-dotted dress. I'd count at least forty others in that building
wearing something close to it, and as I moved up in line, hoped she was
there. I couldn't shout her name out because the others in line were
having casual conversation, probably drowning my voice out. </p>
<p>After about five minutes, I came to the front of the line, and
grabbed my fine-point Parker ballpoint pen out of my purse after I took
off my jacket and handed it to a man collecting coats. An older woman
with curly blonde hair sat at the table, crossing off names on a list
and handing out number tags to the contestants. Spectators were being
herded into the other doors directed towards the bleachers, while us
contestants were coming in from the right and onto the dance floor. </p>
<p>"Last name and number sugar?" the woman asked me, having sort of a
beatnik-ish tone of voice. </p>
<p>"Gellar, #131." </p>
<p>She looked down on the sheet, marked off like a voter's registers
with each page cut at the edge so she could easily thumb to the first
letter of each name. The lady thumbed to the G sheet, and then ran her
finger through the list until she saw G-E-L. "Is that L-E-R or L-A-R at
the end?" </p>
<p>"With an A," I told her, getting a little antsy. So little time to
prepare, and hopefully I'd be able to locate Rory's angelic face
somewhere within the crowd. I stretched out my neck, looking for her as
the lady at the table confirmed my information. </p>
<p>Then she noticed my distracted state, and asked what was up. "Are
you looking for your dance partner?" </p>
<p>I nodded towards her as she handed me the clipboard so I could sign
next to my name. "Yeah, she said she would meet me here--" </p>
<p>The woman became wide-eyed as realization hit her. "Wait, blonde,
brown-eyed, little short, funny name...that's you!" </p>
<p>I was puzzled for a moment, why was she describing me this way? "Uh,
yeah, that's me I guess," I told her, mumbling. </p>
<p>"Rory's sitting in the bleachers waiting for you inside, she wanted
you to know that 'cause she thought you might get lost here, being from
Hartford and all." The lady smiled at me, and I couldn't help but thank
Rory for thinking things out in advance. </p>
<p>She handed me my tag and a safety pin, numbered with 131 so I could
hang it off the front of my dress. "Good luck dear," she told me, and I
walked into the small, cozy gymnasium where I'd be sharing the next few
hours of my life with the girl I liked. I thought it was sweet that Rory
had gone up to the woman and asked if she could go in early just so I
could find her, because in that crowd I may have never been able to. I
know if I was at a charity ball and had to search for my date I may have
never found them at all. </p>
<p>I walked in and was immediately in awe with the setting; this gym
had been untouched by time or renovation, something out of <i>Hoosiers</i>.
There were ropes of balloons hanging above the dance floor, in all
colors of the rainbow, along with an older scoreboard hanging on a far
side of the wall. There was a temporary digital scoreboard towards the
end line on the far side of the gym that read '24:00:00', but it didn't
distract from the décor of the setting at all. </p>
<p><i>I'm not going to bitch about a single anachronism here, this
town's done their work</i>, I thought to myself as I brought my gaze
over to the bleachers to locate Rory. </p>
<p>It didn't take all that long, and the moment I saw her from across
the room, she saw me and got up from her seat as she talked to a guy at
the refreshments table, sipping from a foam cup. I knew from first sight
that was Luke, the diner owner she was talking to, and of course, she
was drinking coffee. </p>
<p>There was twenty feet between us on that first look, but I'll just
say this; even if that had been the first time I had ever met Rory and
laid eyes on her, I would've been just as needy for her as I was in that
moment, falling in love on first sight. </p>
<p>My mouth started watering as I took in the dress she was wearing. It
was hardly what anyone in this modern age would call sexy, but the way
she looked in it just made me want to sweep her off her feet right away.
The red fabric was bright, and gave off this warm aura that I wanted to
bask in. There was but a little skin exposed on her front, but that
would help cool down my hormones a little. </p>
<p>It looked as vintage as the dress I was wearing, but what she was
wearing, she could've just come back from a dressmaker's shop in
Hartford circa 1943 in a time machine. It fit her slim figure perfectly,
like a glove, and I was drawn down to her legs immediately. The skirt
fell just a little below her knees, but I could tell that it would
flare out and spin whenever we tried something daring. </p>
<p>My heart was beating so fast; it was then I came back to reality. I
was going to dance with her, for such a long time. This wasn't just any
other dance, where if I got bored I could take a break and recharge at
the punch bowl as Brady McHotguy boasted about how wonderful he was and
wore out the letter 'I' so much it fainted and begged for mercy from
being used so much. I'd only have twenty minute breaks here and there to
cool my heels, and then right back into the frying pan and the fire. </p>
<p>What if I fell down that first minute and got us disqualified right
off the bat? If we bumped another couple as we danced and started a
rivalry we really didn't want, or danced so much we eventually fainted
and ended up in the hospital? What if I couldn't keep my hands off her,
and in a sudden movement I moved in too close... </p>
<p>"Paris?" </p>
<p>I was jolted out of those thoughts as Rory came closer to me,
holding another foam cup of something. I looked up at her and shook the
negative thoughts of the event out of my head as our eyes met. </p>
<p>God, I was right a year ago when I told her she was comparable to a
Disney princess; she looked like birds really dressed her. Her hair had
a rose decoration the same color as mine was, a light pink, as if karma
was trying to nudge us together. I noticed her fingernails were sort of
a cherry red, making my uncolored yet polished nails seem pale in
comparison. She was smiling at me, a little bleary just as everyone else
was from being up at such an early hour. </p>
<p>"Hi Rory," I told her as she gave me a nice once-over of my dress
and I did the same. Her eyes raked over my frame, failing as I hoped to
find a thing out of place or bringing down my beauty high, and then she
told me that I looked really, really nice. I blushed and I told her that
she was certainly no slouch in the beauty department either, there was
a lot of nervous conversation going on to start out the morning. </p>
<p>She then handed over the other foam cup she held to me after we got
over our nerves. She sipped from her cup, and I had a perverted thought
about really wanting to be the lip of that cup. I swear I was giving her
that same look Ally did towards Georgia as the other woman sipped the
foam head of her cappuccino... </p>
<p>Thankfully before I could get into
Charlie-Brown-eyeing-the-little-redheaded-girl mode or lick my lips,
Rory decided to let me know what she gave me. "Uh, I didn't know if
you'd drink coffee if it didn't have soy milk because Luke had to make
enough to serve the entire competition, so he also made up a large pot
of wintergreen tea. Is that OK, I can get you something else--" </p>
<p>My mouth thankful for any kind of fluid that didn't have Evian on
the label (I think I drank my body weight in the stuff that day and a
half before), I sipped the hot concoction, my nose basking in the sweet
scent of the drink, and the relaxing vapors of the steam. It felt really
good going down, and with the contained caffeine within, I could tell
that recharging my synapses throughout the day with Luke's wintergreen
tea was something I might have to start repeating every weekday. </p>
<p>After I gulped the tea down, I stopped Rory's ramble, smiling at
her. "No, no, this stuff right here?" I pointed at the cup, followed by
my stomach. "Hits the spot, that'll wake me up, though I did sleep from
about six on until four this morning." </p>
<p>"I'm glad." She seemed relieved, playing a doting girl to my
temperamental nature. "We have to go see the nurse for a quick physical,
just something very routine to make sure we're both tip-top, she
doesn't want to have any surprises befalling her." </p>
<p>"Turn my head and cough, walk a few steps, make sure I'm not
carrying a benign form of the plague kind of exam?" I asked, and Rory
shook her head. </p>
<p>"Come on, the line's building up," she told me, and took my hand so
that we could get in the line. Thankfully the exam was thorough, yet
brief and there was no use of a stethoscope, because if she had found my
heart racing from the adrenaline rush of the event and being so close
to Rory I might have been sitting in the bleachers just watching. </p>
<p>After finishing the exam, we went back over to the refreshments
table, where Luke was standing sentry over the food and beverages. I
told him that I loved his wintergreen tea (he poured me another cup as
we chatted), and we settled those differences that arose in the heat of
the Oppenhemier pursuit. </p>
<p>"I didn't really mean to assert that you ran a brothel," I told the
guy, who would make a perfect model for a paper towel wrapping. "I just
was a little intense that day, and for that I'm sorry Mr. Danes." </p>
<p>"Hey, its fine Paris, I've been called a lot worse by some citizens
in this town, but the way you put it to me, and then Jess coming in and
trying to push my buttons..." </p>
<p>"Yeah, he's a troublemaker. But from what I heard he's finally
cooperating with you, Rory's been keeping me clued in..." Rory came over
just then after retrieving her own number and safety pin pair. "...And
here she is now." </p>
<p>"Hey, you two patched things up pretty quickly," she said as she
handed me the piece of paper and pin. </p>
<p>"All it took was the wintergreen tea." Luke and I said our goodbyes,
and my mind was able to focus on the reason she handed me her dance
marathon number. "What's up?" </p>
<p>"Pin me please," she said with her innocent smirk. "I tried it
myself, but I can't reach that far around my back." </p>
<p>Rory turned around, and somehow I kept my fingers unshaken enough to
not jab the point of the pin through her skin as I threaded it through
the paper of the number and the material of her dress. "There you go," I
told her as I snapped the safety pin to place. Rory then turned around
to face me, and asked me if she could pin my number to my dress. </p>
<p>Noticing that I had absolutely no material in back except towards
the bottom of my spinal column, her pinning a number would be a little
too close to home. I shuddered as my mind created that scenario, and
with the only other option being pinning it to my front, I decided it
was probably best to forgo the safety pin entirely, along with any help
from Rory. Instead, there was thankfully a roll of black electrical tape
on the judge's table. So I brought the number below my breasts and went
to town, taping the number on somehow without Rory's help. I think I
saw her frown a bit at losing possible contact with my bustline, but
that was all forgotten as Taylor, overzealous with his use of the
megaphone, called all the contestants out to the floor for the
five-minute call. </p>
<p>"That's us," she said cheerfully, as she took my right into her left
and we got onto the dance floor, ready to scope out the competition. I
was in the mode I had been in so many times before with Rory; know thy
enemy, and don't play into thy enemy's weakness. </p>
<p>Thy enemy that day for both of us; Kirk Gleason. Usually known as
the town's bachelor, nerd, all-around geek, if it's a derogatory term
for a nervous man like him, I could say it. But once he got on that
dance floor, Rory had told me, that façade disappeared, and he
turned into this dancing machine that would make Michael Flatley run
away crying towards the woman who had borne him. He had won the
competition for eight years straight, and this year was going for number
nine. His dance partner was in it for the cup and the glory, and they
were usually a professional who was on his team for the same reason
some second-stringer from the La Crosse team of the CBA begged for a
Lakers contract; to win. Rory told me that every year once the last
couple was knocked out of the competition, he'd take the trophy around
the gym floor to the strains of the love theme to <i>Rocky</i>. </p>
<p>Rory and I headed towards center court, and my eyes immediately met
with Kirk's, a stern gaze that was telling him I wasn't here just for a
little fun, I was here to win. I could care less about the whatever the
prize package was, and Rory could keep the trophy, but I wanted to leave
that floor in approximately twenty-four hours and three minutes declared
the champion along with her. </p>
<p>Though of course the number one reason, that I wanted close contact
with her for so long was shallow. Wasn't about to let Kirk know that
though. </p>
<p>"Hey," he started, trying to get right into his mode of
intimidation. "Good luck to you two." </p>
<p>Yeah, nice try there Gleason, I don't play nice. "Whatever," I said,
brushing him off. "I have a feeling you'll be seeing Rory and I on this
floor into the witching hours." </p>
<p>"Until you break a heel," he told us offside, reminding us both of
how Lorelai lost her footing the last three years and stumbled to the
ground in agony around the nine o'clock point. Rory didn't take the
comment well and grimaced at him. I had to keep her calm, so I decided
to move away from him. </p>
<p>"Trust me, we're different. Even if we have to ditch our shoes we'll
still be here to stop your streak," she told him as we walked away and
towards the judge's stand. I couldn't hear his response to her witty
retort, but he was just a distraction. </p>
<p>I set a hand on her shoulder, trying to get her in the zone, so to
speak. "Don't listen to him Gilmore, he's just bitter because he's never
been able to parlay his titles into any kind of meaningful
relationship." I smirked at her, and hoped she'd catch onto my very
obvious and screaming hint that I hoped this day would turn into a lot
more at the end. Rory laughed, and we settled down, preparing for the
beginning of this whole ordeal. </p>
<p>A volunteer handed out yellow cards to all of us, and Taylor let us
know the rules for those who needed a refresher course, but that I had
down from the moment I accepted Rory's invitation. We had to stay moving
and touching throughout, which meant there wasn't going to be any
tossing your partner in the air allowed, or any other kind of wild move
you'd see in <i>Strictly Ballroom</i>. The breaks would happen whenever
Taylor sounded the scoreboard horn, lasting twenty minutes each,
allowing us to recover. I could also take one individual ten minute
break if I gave up my yellow card, kind of like a strategic last-laps
pit stop in an auto race if we could keep it up into the late hours.
That meant Rory and I were going to have to keep close eyes on each
other's health and let the other know that it was time to yellow card
out for a break. </p>
<p>With a minute to go, Rory and I met, exchanging direct eye contact
and setting her hands in mine. She trusted me with her fate, in her
town, at that moment. The last thing I wanted to do that day was be a
major disappointment and stumble. God, I could already see the image of
myself tripping on the volleyball pole socket in the gym floor and
stumbling on my ass as the horn of doom sounded, Rory helping me up but
not looking at me as I left town in shame. </p>
<p>My blood was flowing through my body so fast I could feel it in my
veins, and despite not a smidgen of physical activity yet, my sweat
glands were stirred up. I had prepared for that however, knowing I
didn't have any material on the side to catch any drops, so I had to use
a high-powered anti-perspirant. What wasn't helping however was Rory's
proximity to me. It wasn't even six o'clock, and just the simple touch
of her hands, they were getting me aroused. I felt stiff, nervous, and
strange. <i>What if this isn't right,</i> I thought to myself as Rory's
crystal pupils raked over my form, getting a sense of my curves and
where to set her arms. Her fingers were bare, rubbing up against the
ring on my right non-writing hand I received from my paternal Aunt
Ingrid for my bat mitzvah. </p>
<p>She drew my attention, taking my focus off my worries for a moment.
If she knew what I wanted to do at that moment, which didn't involve
dancing with her, at least in the literal and academic sense, but in a
bedroom definition, I swore she would've probably freaked. Thankfully my
mind didn't telegraph anything, as she gave me a reassuring smile,
bringing her left hand up and running a finger in my hair and along the
petals of the flower in it. </p>
<p>"You ready for this Paris?" she said in a hushed voice as Taylor
finished reading off a list of sponsors for the event. "Last chance to
back out, you don't have to do this." Rory's voice wasn't in a mood of
protestation, rather in a challenging tone. She then brought her hand
down from my scalp, a finger lingering against the halter strap near my
neck in a way that almost made me moan. She then brought the hand down
my arm and back into my hand, leaving behind a building swath of
goosebumps rising up from each millimeter of skin she touched, making
the small hairs I had along the top rise. Her words worked alchemy in my
ears and her breath tickled my nose, getting me back into the
hyperfocus I had maintained since I asked Francisca to help me with an
outfit choice Thursday night. A perfectly blended mix of triple-striped
AquaFresh toothpaste combined with two cups of coffee was what I sensed
in that one slight sniff of her breath as the minty taste of her went
into my nose. </p>
<p>I swallowed down a last gulp of my wintergreen tea that I was
swirling around my mouth to coat it so I could stay as hydrated as
possible before the noon break, handing the cup off to a volunteer to
toss. My lovesick side may not have been ready to go, but my empathy
was. I wanted to help Rory win this, for her mother, for the town, and
in a small way, for myself. Six years removed from my last recital on
the stage of the Southington Civic Auditorium, taken out of my element
so fast by my mother and pushed into a lonely existence devoid of all
the fun I had in my early childhood. The only thing that came out of
that so far was a need for Harvard so I could flee her influence, an
aborted crush on a former friend and tormenter, and a rivalry that
hopefully after this day, would turn into something more, maybe even
love. </p>
<p>Rory wanted this. I wanted this. That was all that mattered in the
end, no one else did. </p>
<p>I gripped her wrist tightly, looking right into her eyes, a
confident smirk settling on my lips as I saw Taylor finish his
announcement and prepare to depress the button on the scoreboard's
control panel signaling the beginning of this ordeal. </p>
<p>"Oh yeah," I told her, my voice not wavering. "I'm ready, it's time
to swing." </p>
<p>She smiled, relieved that I was ready to go. We took our place in
the layout of the couples, our 131 number putting us towards the top of
the east key lane of the basketball layout, right on the curve of the
three-point line. In a way, this whole ordeal was going to be like a
miracle shot from three-quarters of the court away, 185 couples, Kirk
and his partner between Rory, I, and victory. Hopefully we could sink
this shot at the title. </p>
<p>Holding our hands together, we both counted down with the crowd from
ten to one that first horn signaling the beginning. It felt like ten
minutes, but once Taylor yelled the words "And...GO!", then tapped his
finger on that scoreboard horn button, things were under way. Right away
one couple left, there just to continue a streak of 'appearances' at
the dance marathon. It may have been just 30 seconds, but nonetheless
it counted on the record. </p>
<p>We both got right to work, discovering that we were quite in sync
with what we had both rehearsed for the last couple of days in our own
individual homes. The first hour seemed to flow by in a fast adrenaline
rush, Rory's hand imprints hot against my sides as we danced...well, the
morning away. A time where I'd usually be in my pajamas cursing the
state of 'educational' television as I found instead <i>Trading Spaces</i>
reruns or some crap show on channel 30 about a haunted high school that
looked awfully small to be one in actuality, was instead spent with my
hands against her elbows, spinning around the hardwood gym floor, both
of the skirts of our dresses spinning in the air as we danced to the
sounds of remastered Benny Goodman Band music, recalling a simpler time
where...sadly, Chilton was all-female and very exclusive, you had to be
part of a select group of Hartford elite to even be considered for a
slot in the school. If Rory and I lived back then, we would never meet,
since her mother probably would have had to give her away after birth
and been sent to a convent in shame for having an illegitimate child,
and Rory would be stuck in the vicious circle of the foster system. </p>
<p>God bless you Gloria Steinham, for I now have a new and sobering
appreciation for the women's liberation movement. Back to hopefully many
more minutes of dancing with the girl of my dreams... </p>

<h4> Rory's POV, 6:05am</h4>

<p>When I got up this morning, I had expected Paris to be dressed to the
nines, far from her normal demeanor because of the period dress we
pretty much had to adhere to. There was a part of me honestly that was
scared however, that she wouldn't take it as seriously as I thought she
was, and she'd either come in a dress that looked like it came from the
forties, but was bought off the shelf at Vera Wang the day before. I was
also under the impression that she might get lost trying to find her way
towards me, so I had Babbette ask her to come right into the gym and
find me in there instead of waiting out in the front foyer near the
ticket window hopeful Par would recognize me in the red sea of white
polka dots. </p>
<p>Once I got into the gym, I marveled at how beautiful the place was
done up, each year the students manage to outdo the class from the year
before who decorate the gym. The student council at Stars Hollow High
worked deep into the night, leaving at one before everything was period
and perfect. From the small touches, like the free throw lane on the
basketball floor taped up and filled in so the key would resemble how it
was when the school opened in 1941, to the checkerboard tablecloths at
the refreshments table, and the nurse in 40's garb, candy-striped apron
and all, not to mention the strings of balloons hanging from the
rafters, everything was perfect. The digital time clock at the west end
of the gym could easily be forgotten since I had on an antique watch
passed down through my grandma's side of the family over the years
substituting on my left wrist for the old Dean bracelet, now passing
through Old Lyme on its way into the Long Island Sound, I'd just check
that and with my superb time-telling skills, easily deduce how much time
I had left. </p>
<p>I was getting nervous as I went to the judge's table after
retrieving a cup of water from Luke in order to balance out my thirst
with caffeine. Since I revealed my feelings to Patty yesterday, I was
brainstorming what I wanted to do if Paris and I survived the
twenty-four hours and managed to beat Kirk. There was no way in hell I
was going to skip hand in hand with her parading the trophy around the
sidelines of the gym floor to the strains of <i>Gonna Fly Now</i>. If
we were to win, the celebration would be on my terms; calm and
collected, thankful, and probably worn out. I clutched the jewel case I
took out of the pocket of my dress and looked over towards Miss Patty,
distracted by a very young blonde boy who was unaware that the older
woman was looking at him like a strawberry creamsicle. </p>
<p>"Patty, I need a favor," I told her, and she kind of looked forlorn
as I distracted her from the guy and looked towards me, but just for a
moment, before she drew her attention towards me and appraised my dress. </p>
<p>"My Rory, you clean up very well. I think you're going to make all
the guys jealous today!" She laughed, and thankfully we were both far
enough away so that no one could hear what we were saying. </p>
<p>"Yeah, too bad I'm not partnering up with them," I said, before
getting honest. "I'm kind of scared though, what if she's not into it?" </p>
<p>"Child, did you not say yesterday that she'd be good, why doubt it
now?" </p>
<p>"But Kirk looks like tough competition this year, again." I rolled
my eyes as both of us looked towards him, showboating with his redheaded
partner as he threw her four feet in the air then caught her with arms
right at the top of her back and rear. </p>
<p>"Don't stress yourself, we're not grading on style, but endurance.
Between you and I though," she whispered into my ear. "I'd watch out for
Taylor, he has a couple dirty tricks up his sleeve to thin out the
crowd." </p>
<p>"Such a masochist that guy," I joked, and we both laughed as I
handed Patty my CD. "If miraculously Par and I get to 5:57, play track
ten for me please, it's a milestone song for both of us. I promise you
right now I won't do a victory lap, by then the only thing I'll have in
mind is getting to bed." </p>
<p>"Of course, Rory dear." She took the CD and scanned the back cover
until she found what track ten was. "I agree, that is a very nice song
choice." </p>
<p>"Thanks, wish me luck, this is for my mom, who couldn't be here
today to try to topple Kirk, and Paris, who really needs a day of fun."
I smiled at her, and she smiled back at me. </p>
<p>"I'll be rooting for you silently," and then she said goodbye and
went back towards the judges' stand. I finished my cup of water, and
went back to Luke's table to pour myself a hot cup of joe. We had a
quick chat, and I warned him about who my partner was. At first he was
surprised, but then I assured him that Paris wasn't going to be
attitudinal in the way she was that day she came to town in order to
milk the Rory Curtain for all it was worth for the Oppenheimer prize. </p>
<p>Because he had to use one of those large Bunn tanks to provide the
entire community coffee, he didn't have all the tools to customize it so
I couldn't get Paris her usual hazelnut with soy milk. However, I did
notice another tank off to the side... </p>
<p>"Luke, what's with the other tank, extra coffee?" </p>
<p>"Actually," he said in his sarcastic but softie-type way, "Not
everyone likes coffee as much as you and your mother do, some can't even
take the stuff. Thus, I made up some wintergreen tea." </p>
<p>I thought to myself for a moment, wondering if Paris wouldn't mind
that as a substitute for coffee since soy milk wasn't available. She had
made it clear she loathed non-dairy creamer ("It never dissolves in the
cup just right" she told me once), and Luke had those little
mini-thimble packs of half-and-half in a bowl that would do a number on
her stomach. I had a thought then and there of how her mouth would taste
if she would drink wintergreen tea. I became lost in my thoughts for a
moment as I basked in a hopeful future thought of her kissing me, the
inside of her mouth tasting of a mix of tea and her beloved vanilla
Velamints. I actually shut my eyes and went with it until I felt a
strong hand shake my shoulder. </p>
<p>Luke had thankfully distracted me from the thought, and I quickly
brushed off my inattentiveness due to a lack of sleep. I asked him for a
big foam cup of tea, and he complied, handing me the cup, and then I
sat down to continue a conversation where he talked about how he missed
Lorelai's usual six dollar a day coffee habit. <i>I'm sure he misses
the company too</i>, I thought to myself as I sipped the coffee as slow
as I could so the effects would be spread through the six hours I'd be
separated from it and dancing with Paris instead. </p>
<p>I was looking at my watch impatiently. 5:50am, it read back to me. I
started to panic a little, wondering where Paris was. I knew she had to
park in back by the baseball diamond and that she'd have a long line to
deal with before she checked in with Babbette, but it wasn't supposed to
take that long, was it? She said she'd meet me there, 5:45 sharp, with
bells on. I even gave her all the information she needed so that she
wouldn't run into any problems. </p>
<p>I started internalizing my worst fears into my mind; those which
would bring us back to the enemies track. What if she thought I was
joking and I didn't actually want to go, or she panicked herself and
didn't want to attend? Maybe her mother found out and was sealing Paris
in her room Rapunzel-style, her hair not long enough for me to climb... </p>
<p>OK, getting a little weird with the Rapunzel comparison there, but
in my mind, anything was a possibility. She could've even accepted then
decided to stand me up as revenge for what I did to her by trying to get
her and Tristan to go out. Yes, I saw a mental picture of her cackling
evilly at her desk, finally getting her just desserts at my expense. </p>
<p>I kept talking to Luke, trying to drown those thoughts out... </p>
<p>And then finally, Paris was twenty feet from me, looking around just
as awed at the decorations as I was. She walked in, her head craning up
towards the middle of the ceiling towards the frame the balloons were
strung up around and the period-specific decorations throughout the
gymnasium. </p>
<p>I squinted my eyes a little to get a clearer look at her through the
dimmed light of the room, and felt my heart swell with pride, want, and
desire. She was definitely in this for the long run. </p>
<p>She started coming closer, and I was able to start making out what
she was wearing. It was a beautiful black dress, decorated all over with
a pattern of red cherry tomatoes, only hammering home the theme of our
first connection to each other; the salads. Never changing, the only
thing I can say with certainty was routine in the time we knew each
other. </p>
<p>What wasn't routine however, was how much skin she was showing off.
As she came closer and closer, I kept my attention off of her, trying to
keep my eyes appraised on a Rosie the Riveter poster off to a far
corner. My face was looking towards there, but my eyes, fully on Paris. </p>
<p>The dress showed off her best attributes, her long legs,
perfect-for-me stomach, and the breasts only she could have and somehow
get a full rein on. It was a halter and the only thing my inner vixen
was thinking was <i>Man, it's gonna be hard to keep from undoing that
back tie for 24 hours, ain't it Gilmore? </i>I was right about her
getting revenge on me; It was just a lot more sexual and unknowing than
I expected. I swear to God she made me look like I was in the Order of
St. Agnes, it's as if she was going to milk all this time so close
together for all it was worth. My mouth watered and I was lost to
comment. </p>
<p>She had no bra on; her best attribute was out there for me to ogle
shamelessly and without any guilt, I almost flushed red, knowing she
probably did this on purpose to either rile me up or to give me a bigger
case of nerves. She was but ten feet from me, and there I was, my eyes
hardly looking at her face at all, but down at her deep cleavage, at
least five inches from the top until her dress' neckline flared back up
again towards the other halter strap. </p>
<p>Paris then turned around in a twirl, giving me a look at her back,
the dress plunging at least to the mid-lower section of it. Since she
had a little more weight on her than I did I couldn't make out the
curvature of her spine, but that was but a small nag, since the skin was
nice and dark. Then my eyes finally drifted up towards her proud and
broad shoulderblades, which had probably taken a beating over the years
from having so much on them, clothes, backpack straps, emotional
baggage. It was sort of a sign to me saying that with all the weight of
her halter dress on her neck and nothing on her shoulders, Paris was
sending me the message that she was free for the day; 'I'm completely
yours'. I started smiling then as my gaze went up to her head and face;
There was little makeup covering her usually flawless features because
of the length of time she'd be with me, and just a smidge of red
lipstick. </p>
<p>Her hair was elegantly done up, free from a ponytail, and every
strand curled over, with a rose that matched mine in the left side. God,
every date with Dean he threw whatever he had on, and when he helped me
come out to society (debutauntally, not in the gay sense of course),
even then the rental tuxedo screamed that he'd rather be tuning a car
than dancing uncomfortably. But Paris Gellar, she never does things
halfway, not even for social events. The only other time I recall her
wearing a dress besides when I helped her with the Tristan situation
and the Winter Formal was that long black dress she wore for my
Hartford 16th birthday party, and even though she was there by force
rather by choice, I still thought she looked very nice, unlike the rest
of the girls there who were looking good just so they could get a guy
they could take to bed that night. </p>
<p>That's what I admire about Paris; she'll always be her own woman, on
her own terms, no matter how her mother might try to influence
everything about her. I saw the beginnings of what I think is a
rebellion that night she crawled in my window and apologized, and though
I knew she had to lie to get here (thank goodness for the always handy
'Going-to-Boston' excuse when it comes to Mrs. Gellar), she's trying to
be herself finally. Still neurotic, a little grating on my nerves at
times and ready at will to provoke me into an argument, but Paris is
proving herself to be as far from the girl I first met two years ago as
can be. </p>
<p>She then found my attention, and I said her name, almost in shock
and making sure this was the same girl I shared a desk with in two
classes, indeed it was. </p>
<p>"Uhhh, you look very, very nice, I'm surprised, yeah," I said
nervously, letting my mind speak for me. "I mean I didn't expect you in
that dress, not at all, I mean you're usually very shy about wearing
something like that and I thought..." I mentally slapped myself, trying
to regain my words. "Anyways, not the point, you're looking beautiful
today." </p>
<p><i>And you wonder why only Dean found you datable</i>, my conscious
rubbed in as she sort of laughed nervously, and I tried to regain my
center. I was scared that she was going to call me Mary, but there was
never anything to worry about. </p>
<p>"The birds got up early this morning and helped you out, didn't
they?" Apparently she still recalled the conversation we had when she
convinced me to become her VP, and I blushed as she complimented me.
"Very nice dress and period-appropriate attire, makeup and demeanor
Gilmore, I compliment you for going as full-tilt with this as you should
have." Surprisingly yes, in Gellar's world that would be considered a
compliment, so I smiled back at her. </p>
<p>"Thank you." I then gave her another silent once-over, my mind
making heads and tails that this girl, no, woman was going to be my
dance partner for the next hopefully twenty-fours. We both seemed to be
giving each other attention, staring at each other. Then when I put the
rim of my coffee cup to my lips to take a quick sip, her gaze moved from
my eyes right down to my mouth. I gave her the foam cup of tea in order
to see if that would draw her attention off. She clasped the cup in her
hands half-heartedly, concentrating her eyes on my lips, maybe giving
herself a few ideas. The slow seduction was continuing to work its
magic, and it was almost as if I was back in her room Tuesday morning
asking her to warm me up. If she only knew how much I wanted to feel
her lips against mine instead of that Styrofoam. </p>
<p>Still, I had to keep her attention on the dance ahead, so I drew her
attention from me and onto the tea. I let her know that Luke couldn't
get soy milk, so that would have to do for a caffeine fix. I thought she
wouldn't be enthusiastic about the substitution, but she sipped the tea
anyways and found it very much to her liking. So much that we had to
stop at Luke's table again after a quick nurse's exam to make sure we
were fit enough for the next 24 hours, so she could pour herself
another cup of the stuff, which helped her cause with Luke. Paris
complimented his brewing skills and apologized for being too intense
that late January day earlier in the year we stopped at the diner and
she accused him of being a house of ill repute. Luke took it cool and
easy-going, leaving me relieved that I could cross out one con on the
small list I still maintain and plan to update tomorrow with anything I
can find out about her. </p>
<p>Next part of the plan; more innocent touching. I had Paris pin my
number on the back of my dress, and enjoyed the small little sparks her
fingertips sent up my spine as she worked the dress material into the
safety pin and slid it through. I felt her rub against the hook of my
bra for a bit, and had to think about one of Dean's lamer makeout
sessions in order to keep my legs steady. Geeze, what that girl does to
me sometimes... </p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't get to share the opportunity with her to pin
the number to her own person. Due to her choice of dress, she couldn't
pin it to her back, and I had a large feeling that she wouldn't let me
dare pin the number on the only other place it could be pinned, below
her breasts. So I had to imagine that instead as I watched her
anti-climatically tape the number to the front of her dress instead, my
body very disappointed and having to make do with another longing look
down at her cleavage in her distracted state. This was about the time I
started recalling all those lessons in basic science that what comes up,
must come down eventually when it comes to gravity. I hope Paris tied
the back in a very tight knot, because knowing her gravitational pull,
I might be seeing more than her cleavage by say, hour number twenty. </p>
<p>"Alright everyone, five minutes to go, please head to your numbered
positions on the dance floor, you'll find a taped 'X' with a Dyno label
marking your number below your feet. You must stay on that spot unless
Patty or I tell you to move for an elimination game or you make it into
the final hours..." There was Taylor, blathering on and on about the
rules of the marathon, so I took Paris' hand into mine and we took our
place on the floor, a few spots down from Kirk. He was already looking
at us with disgust, not about the concept of two girls dancing, but
because he seemed to remember Paris back from her dancing days. Kirk had
seen her when she was nine and had thought since she was a Harfordian,
would never set foot in Stars Hollow to try to take his title. Paris
had never met Kirk, but she regarded him as she did me the first time I
stepped beneath the gargoyles two years ago, an enemy combatant. </p>
<p>Her eyes turned cold, as did his as they stared each other down like
they were about to duel in the town square. Kirk's partner also had a
stern look on her face, and I stared her down. Small, meek, thin as a
rail, the redhead he was dancing with had all the makings of a
professional dancer, without the charisma of one. I wanted one of them
to stomp one another's feet so Paris and I could take this. </p>
<p>Kirk attacked Paris' heels, which I easily took as an attack on
Lorelai the last few years. My eyes darted towards him as Paris defended
me and told him we'd be bringing home the trophy this year. <i>Poor
little Rocky against Apollo Creed</i>, I thought to myself with a
mirthful smirk, thinking that this year would turn out a lot different.
We both regarded the nervous man with caution, and she started giving
him a steely gaze, screaming 'bring it on' towards him. They moved a
little closer and I thought that was about the time I had to get them
separated, feelings of loathing for his streak or not. She moved away
herself though, and told him we would win barefoot if we had to. I
laughed, but in the back of my mind knew that she was dead serious about
the threat. If Paris had to, she'd find any one of Kirk's weaknesses
and manipulate them into bringing us closer to victory circle. </p>
<p>As we saw the volunteer hand out the emergency yellow cards, she
reminded me that Kirk's wins had never led to any kind of relationship
for him, not even a groupie. She said this in a way I took as that after
we won, we wouldn't drift off out of each other's lives and be able to
enjoy the victory...and maybe even a little more than that. I laughed
at her as Taylor went into TMI detail about the uses of the yellow
cards that would give you a ten minute break if you held it up,
describing an example where someone ate a few too many cold cuts and had
a sudden urge to throw up on their partner's shoulder. I took my
attention away from that, and looked at the girl I was about to hold in
my arms for such a long time. </p>
<p>She stared at Taylor as he went on with his words, taking them in
carefully and leaving me to gaze at her beauty. Honestly, not in my most
romantic dreams did I think she could look that sexy, or sizzling in
that dress. I mean to have less than 40 hours to not only practice, but
put together a look, find a nice dress and the few embellishments she
had on (no earrings or other jewelry to go with her look besides her
birthstone Jewish star, a small ring on her right hand, and the pink
rose in her hair), for another girl in her shoes, it may have been
overwhelming. For Paris though, it was a challenge she relished to meet
full on. When she came into that room, whatever she did to shine in my
eyes, I could tell that it was all worth it. The idea for her to dance
with me may have been nutty and off-center when I came up with it, but
moment by moment I was under the impression that in the end it might all
be worth it. </p>
<p>Taylor finished his speech and the countdown towards the last minute
started, Paris' gaze shifting over from the community and towards me.
Her deep browns looked into mine, and I eased my hands into hers, saying
in a way that I trusted her. I found her to be sort of uneasy with the
prospect, scared that I would be disappointed if we didn't get further
in the contest. I saw the same scared little girl that she was around
her mother; afraid of disappointment, cursed if the word 'lose' or any
of its variations entered anywhere near her vocabulary. Her father
never intended for her to be miserable in her own skin, but her mother
wanted her to take Vince Lombardi's many axioms about how defeat was
the worst thing in the world and never forget them. I hated Sharon for
making her stone hard and impenetrable. Paris was going to have fun
today, come hell or high water, and I was going to make her forget that
this was a dance contest. Hopefully all this time would lead to
revelations and surprises from her. </p>
<p>I rubbed reassuringly against her knuckles, getting to know more
those same hands and fingers that I dreamed of every night. The slimness
of them in my own palms was in stark contrast to Dean's thick, chunky
fingers and hands, worn and scratched from all that auto work he did
when he wasn't around me. The recollection of his scent, a mix of Skin
Bracer and a harsher industrial equivalent of Lava soap used to make me
swoon. Now all it did was bring Paris' scent to the forefront. </p>
<p>It was, light, much lighter. Orchids, vanilla and still a little bit
of lingering incense-cedar wafting from her fingers, telling me she did
at least a little homework with her pencil before she left. Dean was
harsh-scented, yet kind to me, while Paris had a light scent, yet was
harsh emotionally most of the time around me. </p>
<p>Only, she was starting to show humanity when I was around her, small
touches that gave me hints and peeks at what lay beneath those layers
Paris used to protect herself. She had put those shields up around her
that one day in the shower and kept them strong the three days we were
at odds again. But once she thought about it and came over to my house
to lay with me in bed and confess, she dropped them and confided in me
that she thought she wasn't beautiful. In her eyes, she was homely,
dull, and not much to look at. She'd be a workaholic, content with her
name in the newspapers and no one to come home to at night except a
beagle and maybe a droopy fern once she got out of college. Before I
started to push her, she seemed content to be an old maid. </p>
<p>I'm not going to let that happen though. These romantic feelings I
have for her are too much to bear, and she had to know that in my eyes,
there wasn't a more beautiful girl I knew in the world. So in a
challenging yet kind voice, I asked her if she was sure she wanted to do
this for me. I'd bow out of the dance and find a new way to get Paris'
attention if she didn't want to do this, but I decided to swing her
around to my side. I moved my left hand up into her curled hair,
running my fingers through it in a reassuring way. It was as smooth in
my hands as the tail of a horse, and my fingers raked over the petals of
her rose. </p>
<p>I kept prodding her on as I brought it down to her shoulder, running
my index finger seductively against one of her dress straps. I could see
her eyes wander down as I slipped the tip of the fingernail against the
material, scratching beneath. It was meant as a little warm up, and just
maybe a little revenge for her behavior on Tuesday afternoon in the car.
She coughed out a little breath, and I took it out and ran my hand the
rest of the way down her arm. I told her she could back out if she
wanted to, and as I clasped my hand into hers and Taylor finished his
speech about who was sponsoring the event, I saw her smile at me,
putting on her true game face as he had us go to our spots. </p>
<p>Then she told me she was ready to go with this all, even if the
length turned out to be twenty-four hours. She had a confidence in her
voice I never had heard before, even in our toughest debates with
Hillside Academy. She was truly ready for this all, ready to go, and the
swagger in her words when she told me that it was time to swing...that
confidence created a tingle in my throat and stomach as her fingers
twined around mine after we set ourselves up in our own little spot on
the floor. </p>
<p>I gulped, and for a moment thought to myself, <i>What have I gotten
myself into?</i> There Paris was, the girl of my dreams, looking
drop-dead gorgeous in a vintage black dress that made her look so hot,
and then mousy me, standing in front of her in something conservative.
Her gaze was locked onto mine and raked over my slim footprint. I felt
so unsettled, suddenly coming to the realization that I wasn't taking in
realism for once, instead I had been thinking of an ideal when I came
up with this whole idea. </p>
<p>For God's sakes, I flunked ballet, badly, and never proved myself to
dance in much more than tepid middle school dances and that one Formal!
Who was my partner? Only a dance champion coming out of a six-year
retirement suddenly after I begged and pleaded with her to be my
partner! </p>
<p>What was I thinking, in what world did I think that I would be able
to go on for so long? That I would be a good dancer and that... </p>
<p>I stopped my self-ramble as Taylor started the countdown, and Paris
brought me closer and flush towards her, taking my hands one more time
as we looked towards the judge's table. She was confident, assured, and
trying to bring me into that same state of mind. <i>Just forget
everyone else Gilmore</i>, she seemed to be transmitting to my mind with
her eyes. <i>I'll be here to keep you on your feet all day and night.</i> </p>
<p>Remind me next time if I have access to a time machine and can go
through with seducing Paris again, that a game of Truth and Dare would
be less strenuous than having her participate with me in a dance
marathon. Thank you. </p>
<p>Anyways, Taylor sounded the horn, and I started finding my footing,
right away surprisingly. All those web pages and books seemed to work
from the get-go, and Paris went with what I was doing, letting me lead
as she got re-used to dancing with someone besides herself. I kept a
tight grip on her hands and we concentrated on getting our bodies
moving, rather than getting right into competition with Kirk. The
strains of the music started, and I got right into it, casting aside my
fears and letting Paris guide me through those first few minutes. </p>
<p>Babette and Morey did their usual minute of dancing they do every
year and dropped right out, saying they were exhausted and left the
floor, causing Taylor to roll his eyes for not taking the dance
seriously enough. I smiled at them and told them goodbye, then got back
to the matter at hand. Only five minutes in and Kirk was getting a
little cocky with his dance moves, so it was better for Paris and I to
stay unaffected and just dance normally for the first few hours. </p>
<p>I'm still a little unsure of how close Paris will actually get to me
today, and hopefully we can have some kind of meaningful conversation in
the heat of competition. We certainly can't go this long without
talking, and I need all the talking opportunities I can find since
there's this little nagging fact that only five minutes in, I'm already
yearning to be closer to her and feel a little...we'll say distracted.
She's looking up at me through the haze of the Benny Goodman music, and
I feel like any moment I'd want to drag her off the floor and-- </p>
<p>Yeah, Rory, you're here to dance, and slowly seduce. Besides, it's
too early in the morning to do something like that... </p>

<h4> Paris' POV, 10:15am</h4>

<p>Taylor and Miss Patty were easy on us in those first four hours, not
doing anything to crazy to push couples out. The 2'x2' box we were in
worked well, and I focused more on winning than I did of luring Rory
further. Any odd touch would freak her out and cause her concentration
to be shot, so I kept my hands on an even keel. No wandering, keeping
them either at the sides just below her bra line, or if it was a little
wilder, on her lower arms and elbows. She seemed to stay conservative
with her movements too, not ready to be brave and set a hand on the bare
expanse of skin on my back until a little later. </p>
<p>Admittedly, not everything was going rosy or perfect, at least if
you were looking in from the outside. There was the occasional dirty
looked doled our way from the odd couple or two, and some of the teens
made fun of us, thinking that we were so desperate to get in the
competition that we'd join together because we're dateless losers who
couldn't get a guy to save our lives. Probably the same group of peers
who made Rory beg to get out of the more pronounced cliquish and less
bookish natures of the students who attended this school, and into
Chilton. Kirk was trying to throw us off early by sweeping his dance
partner off her feet and trying to get us to separate so Rory and I
would be horned out of the competition. We rolled our eyes at him and
did our own little spin move, a little more conservative so we could
keep the harder stuff confined to whenever the judges directed us to go
further or storing our energy past the sixteenth hour. </p>
<p>I wasn't ready to release Rory anyhow; she was going to be stuck
with me no matter what. Eventually around nine I found an opening, and
was finally able to place my hands against the small of her back. I had
never been that close to her before; and I could feel her settle in
against my palms. She made a sudden jerking motion as my fingernails
scraped against the fabric of her dress, so I tried to release and move
my hands back up. </p>
<p>"Uhhh, sorry, that feels like a nice place to settle your hands,"
she ranted out nervously. "You don't have to move them Paris." </p>
<p>"Are you sure," I wondered, truthfully. "This is pretty close and I
don't know how Dean danced last year so I just want to keep your nerves
calmed." </p>
<p>Her gaze moved away from the judge's stand and back towards me as
she saw another record being spun. There was a sad, forlorn look in
them, and it was then I knew I had hit something within, bringing back
up her ex. I slowed down a little, the new song being a slower waltz
that threw six fast moving couples for a curve and caused them to
separate. Not three seconds later was the horn sounded anew. "That's it
for 68, 115, 78, 154, 87 and 24, please clear the floor," Miss Patty
projected through the sound system as the disappointed groans of those
couples and the crowd filled the gym. </p>
<p>Maybe she was regretting breaking up with Dean was what I thought as
she looked towards me, our feet moving in time with the music. Yes, I
hated him, but that didn't mean the moment she broke up with him she
developed the same loathsome feelings for him. For all I knew they were
still good friends having fun together. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I told her, hoping that if I said something uncouth I
could recover from that. "I didn't mean to bring him up--" </p>
<p>"No, it's OK, I knew it was going to come up," she conceded. "By
11:01 you'll already have outlasted him, but I've already had more fun
today than I did last year. He was never really into the whole idea
because I took him away from some important body welding time on the car
he built me, I think he did this more out of obligation than to try to
win." </p>
<p>"I won't talk about him again, I promise," I told her, moving my
hands up so we could get more into the song and the dance. "He's been
gone from your life four days and that's a very short time to let
someone completely go. I know when Tristan left both of us it took me at
least a month to recover from the fact that he was gone." </p>
<p>"Yes, but there's a difference. You had feelings for him that went
truly unrequited, so to come into school one day and see another student
taking his old locker, that confirmed to you things would never be the
same. You at least knew him as a friend for the longest time, so you
knew what made him tick, and even though he was pulled away from you so
roughly, you had background with him, knew what he liked and didn't.
With Dean though," she stopped for a moment, sighing as we turned
around in the thinning field of dancers. "I never got a chance to
really know him as just a friend. One day he was there, helping me with
my stuff, and two months later I was kissing him in the market, before
that sneaking around here and there so that I could see him since
Lorelai wasn't receptive to him. He took me by surprise, being the
first guy who was attracted to me, and from there..." she trailed off,
trying to get lost in the song, not wanting to dwell on those memories
of the past. </p>
<p>We continued dancing through the quiet strains of the Viennese
waltz, my mind trying to connect with Rory's to decode what she wanted
to say. I wasn't ready to say much either, because she touched on what I
had with Tristan before the project debacle. It was true that I was
very devastated that he had to leave and I was angry with him for
fucking up things so royally, but still, thirteen years of friendly
history cancels out about ten weeks of him being a total asshole in my
mind. I may have thought in the past that what he did in order to use me
as a pawn to get to Rory was awful, but I still like the boy. He will
come back from North Carolina one day a changed man, or maybe stay down
there and take that second chance he's been given and try to become
someone who will be his own man, free from the constraints of the
DuGrey legacy and Hartford tradition. </p>
<p>I was being truthful to myself however, about the turning point of
my feelings that night. From then on, Rory did become my world, despite
appearances to the contrary. Tristan was the only hurdle between a
lasting friendship between us, and I had by then resigned myself to the
fact Rory and I will be locked in a battle for valedictorian that's
going to be decided by thousandths of a grade point, a very small
margin. My burgeoning feelings for her have also changed another
important facet of my life, and that is I hope that Harvard accepts both
of us. Even if I never admit to her, it would be devastating next
August to not be able to find her on that campus anywhere, having to
settle for her grandparent's true wishes to attend Yale. I told her once
that Harvard had a big campus, that even in our competition, we'd never
see each other those four years in Cambridge. </p>
<p>Even if I couldn't say what I actually thought of her though, not
having Rory at Harvard would leave a large void within me that I would
struggle to fill if she didn't go. We had both gone through the
rehearsal rigors for the interviews with admissions we'd have next month
up in Boston, being very nervous about our responses. I actually wanted
to slug the pompous idiot 'expert' at the seminar who had suggested
with a snort that Hilary Clinton was overused on college applications
when she asked. She might as well have been a single woman seeing as
her husband hit on anything within a 1,000 foot radius until he finally
got caught with Lewinsky. </p>
<p>I brought my focus back towards the girl I liked, seeming sort of
sad in my arms. I hated that I put that look on her face bringing up the
'D' word, so I moved my hands back down towards her hands and smiled. </p>
<p>"Hey," I told her. "Dean was your first, your only for a long time,
and the first boy who took an interest in you. I'll give him that; he
was smart to try to take you off the market first chance he got." She
softly laughed, and I continued on. "But you weren't going to be the
love story of a lifetime, that was always apparent, so don't feel
ashamed for yourself, taking the first opportunity you could to break it
off. I never pegged you for the type to break it off with him that way,
but if you felt it was better to cut it off with him completely for
now, it was probably for the best." </p>
<p>"But what if he was, the love story of my life I mean?" She paused
and bit her lip, and I almost stepped on her shoe in the shock of my
attempt to end the questioning of Dean failing. I regained footing, and
as the slow strains of the song continued, I had to be quick on my feet
to think up an answer. </p>
<p>It seemed like she wanted to challenge me, hear my true feelings on
what I thought of their relationship. I had seen them only a few times
in action, the worst of course being that heart-straining makeout
session he finagled her into as I watched from a second floor window the
end of sophomore year. Our friendship went down in flames from another
Tristan misunderstanding, and in a scenario that could only come from
the pen of a Hollywood screenwriter, he pulled up in the front drive in
his Hicksville Edition Ford Ranger to win her love. Of course she
couldn't say no to a grand gesture like that, and I watched them below
as they kissed, reunited again even though the jerk didn't deserve it. </p>
<p>There was a part of me that wanted to yellow card out of the
question, get some space so I could regain my composure and talk my way
out of it. But Rory seemed to await my response, like she would if
Lorelai was in the same position I was. She probably didn't have much of
a chance to talk to her mother about the sudden breakup in detail after
she got home Tuesday night; since Lorelai was in Nashville she was
leaning on me more for advice. Why not her best friend? </p>
<p>I deflected that off onto her. "Wouldn't you be more comfortable
asking Lane this?" </p>
<p>Rory knew what she was doing, the answer already rehearsed. "She
likes Dean though, that's the problem, she has to see him every day in
school so she's not impartial to my position, and Mrs. Kim thinks he's a
fine guy for me. Everyone's still in love with him except for me and my
mother, Luke too. The town thinks of him as this cute boy I'm letting
go. Though--" </p>
<p>I decided to give her the advice she really needed, not anything
reprocessed through the town's gossip circle. "OK, you really want to
know what I thought about Dean? Because I can't sprinkle my opinion with
NutraSweet and mute it." </p>
<p>"Go ahead," she said as the music reached the bridge, and she pushed
me close to her, moving her hands down to below my bra line and pushing
me closer so I could hear her without some random townie catching the
gossip and staring a circle where it would end with 'purple monkey
dishwasher' suffixed to the end of what I said. </p>
<p>Took me a bit to find the words though. Her fingernails scraped
against my spinal column as she found her bearings, and I had to move my
hands to the same spot to bring her closer together. Really, a large
distraction to keep your wits about when you hope that seam you're
feeling against the heel of your palms isn't Rory's panty line. I kept
my retort relatively intact however. </p>
<p>"Honestly, you've always deserved a lot better, I'd see him and
thought he never deserved you. At first he went along with you, reading,
being responsible and all those other cute things, but after awhile,
you never talked about him all that much anymore at lunch. You'd tell
me how the progress on the car was going and that you were still
together, but once Jess came into town all you could talk about was how
he was misreading your signals towards him and getting jealous. Heck,
I'm surprised he was as muted as he was when he found out Jess
accidentally crashed your car." </p>
<p>I ran my fingers against her back, trying to soothe out any anger
she might have towards me. "I was always uncomfortable around him,
especially when we did the project at Miss Patty's, I remember how much
you really didn't want him there because of the tension you had with
Tristan. The last thing I wanted going into the play was Tristan having
a black eye, so I actually brought a canister of pepper spray every day
Dean watched the rehearsals. I was not only afraid for Tristan, but in a
way, for you." I felt weird being that honest with Rory, telling her
the last thing I wanted was for her to get hurt. But also, knowing about
the kiss at Madeline's party, I knew that Rory might try to be honest
with Dean about what happened eventually. Dean's anger issues would
still come into play, no matter that him and Rory weren't together
during the kiss and there was good reason for both of them to keep it
secret. </p>
<p>My blood still chills at the threat at the 2000 Winter Formal he
made towards Tristan for eyeing Rory. Rory and I may not have gotten
along then, but I'd never wish a guy who threatened physical violence on
her or someone she knew, ever. I already had to deal with someone
abusive in my life in my early years, my mother. I don't talk about it
to anyone unless I can really trust them, because it was so wrenching.
There was some physical abuse, the occasional open-handed slap on the
face or hand and spanking behind my father's back (Daddy was always an
advocate of timeouts and talking anger and feelings out, he always
spared the rod), but most of it was emotional. Ever since Francisca and
my father found out when I was ten it had gone down, but since the
divorce, the rate of put downs from my mother was increasing again,
though still not to the point it was in my early teens. </p>
<p>So in a way, I was scared for her, besides the obvious jealousy I
had when she was with him. Which is another reason I'm scared to admit
to her, if Dean finds out he's not going to be pleased that I honed into
his 'territory'. I only hope if he finds out about this dance marathon
arrangement he'll take it as platonic and not misread the signals. </p>
<p>I looked towards Rory, afraid that my opinion of Dean had changed
hers of mine. But instead, I saw understanding in her eyes. She saw what
I did though mine and understood what my position was. I wasn't going
to tell her I thought she deserved someone much smarter than him, but I
have a suspicion that his intelligence was a card in play as she broke
up with him. </p>
<p>"It's OK Par," she said to me soothingly, "You're right, he never
really was the one for me. I think really, I just took up with him
because he was there, ready to love me, but I never could return the
feelings. Even when I told him I loved him the last day of school, that
was spur of the moment, there was just so much going on--" </p>
<p>I decided to cut her off because I got what I wanted, that she knew
my point of view on Dean. We could always deal with the insider
information at a later time, preferably without 600 other people
surrounding us on the gym floor and sitting in the bleachers. </p>
<p>"Thank you, that's fine for now." I said it a little abruptly, but
she knows when I try to end a talk, so she understood. </p>
<p>Rory nodded, somewhat relieved that she didn't have to go further
with explanations. "You're welcome." We then brought our focus back on
the reason we were on that floor, and started dancing anew... </p>

<h4> Rory's POV, 7:38pm</h4>

<p>Is it possible to think that the old Victorian mold of dating is very
outdated these days? Because that's how I've always felt around Dean
whenever we have gone out. It was always like a template that was
created in 1875; all you had to do was replace 'night at the opera' with
'movie', and 'dinner at a restaurant' with 'McDonald's', update the
clothing and change the mode of transportation from a horse and buggy
to a car, and you had my nights with Dean. Except for the anniversary
dinners (which as the months wore on became few and far between, he
completely forgot about our 15-monther in September), he never did
anything wild or out of place to try to win my love further than he did
with what was expected. Add the fact that he created a scene at every
dance we went to, and you wonder why I kept in the template all the
time. </p>
<p>Let me tell you, it's only six and a half hours in, and I already
feel like I've busted through and torn up the boring template that
defined my love life for so long. I don't know how I've done it, but my
legs are still solid, and I have a big smile on my face as Paris and I
continue to surprise everyone in this little event. I can tell she's
having fun too, and we're both enjoying coming together for this, she's
putting all of her effort into doing her best for not only her, but also
me. </p>
<p>God, not to be sappy here, but the reality of her fingers twined
against my back, and my hands resting just a half-foot above the plunge
in the back of her dress, it's so much better than the fantasy I had of
this all the moment I broke up with Dean and this whole idea sparked
itself in my brain. She's surprised me so much with what she learned ten
years ago, and she's as graceful as a high-society girl can be.
However, you can tell that somewhere inside of her lurks someone who
loathes her own richie template, yearning to be free of it. There was
this one set where we had to samba for a bit for example. The beat was
going strong and I was going with what I had memorized from the webpage
I read, going exactly with what the steps entailed and keeping with the
white and black steps from the diagram. She seemed to know the steps
too, and we kept up the dance in the memorized manner I was used to. </p>
<p>Then, all the sudden, the music swelled, and she released her grip
on my right hand, then tightened onto my left. She forced me into this
amazing spin move that seemed to deplete my oxygen for a bit, and my
heart swelled as I felt myself twirl with her fingertips against mine.
It wasn't something dizzying that went beyond a 270° revolution, but
as her right hand caught my back, it was then I knew she was going to
be my partner for a long time, smiling at me as I caught my breath. </p>
<p>It hasn't been all rosy, however. There are some people in the
crowd, just as I suspected that are in shock that I, the town's golden
girl, decided to invite another girl to dance with her instead of any of
the other guys sitting in the bleachers in that gym, or even Chilton.
There was this one boy, Carl Neufeldt, who is a total pig and used to
make fun of my lack of a love life back in eighth grade, taunting me
daily as I sat at my lonely table with Lane in the cafeteria with my
Walkman and book. He always found any opportunity to make fun of me and
called me a name I hate even more than Tristan's euphemism for me,
'Spinster'. Him and his friends kept pointing at us and making slurs
about my sexual status. Paris was only too happy to use the opportunity
to rub my neck and reassure me that they're a bunch of jackasses and
that compared to Duncan and Bowman, they were only bush league. </p>
<p>I was barely focusing on the crowd however, to tell you the truth.
They were like all the other tables in the dining hall at lunch; jumbled
background noise I could care less about. Instead, as Taylor took
things easy on us in these first few hours, Paris and I did something I
never thought we would. </p>
<p>We talked about things beyond academics. Not that we didn't before,
but Paris hadn't used the card I gave her to really talk about her life
with no restrictions since I gave it her the Sunday morning we shared my
bed. She was comfortable enough around me to bring up Dean, and though
she thought she was getting a little too close to home by mentioning him
in a bad light, I wanted to hear from her, what she thought of him
without the pressure of keeping up appearances. </p>
<p>Hearing her say that she was scared of him last year during the play
project, and that she was afraid he would harm Tristan and I...I had
something drop in my throat as she said that. She sounded so grave,
serious, affected by it, that even in that heated part of our
relationship between truces, she was concerned about me. So concerned
she wasn't gunshy about facing down a boy that had 100 pounds and a foot
on her so that he knew damned well I wasn't a piece of property to be
traded around between guys. Her admission was chivalristic in a way,
and coming from her, showed that even in our worst times, she can't
stand to see me out of her life. </p>
<p>I know how defensive Paris gets too well; it took a lot to push
through her walls in order to get her more over these last few months.
As I dance with her, I can feel them ease slowly away, and this...I
can't help but define Par this way, but she's an older woman in a young
girl's body. Her mother has defined her life, no matter how much she
tries to pull away, and she's seen so much more than I ever have in my
eighteen years, for sure. My mother got me away from the social
pressures of Hartford and raised me to be a kind and smart girl. Paris
however, she's had to live in the shadow of Hartford, and even worse,
her mother. I've thought so many negative things about that woman, and
I've never shared them because I was afraid she would be come defensive
and try to explain away her mother's behavior with an essay-ish speech. </p>
<p>I'll get Paris alone in a room one day, and let her air out anything
about her mother to me. For now though, I feel much more comfortable
with talking to her about things that are light and don't cause that
much controversy. That means staying away from the topic of Tristan and
wondering if she still carries a flame for him. It's funny, the moment
he left us a year ago, he seemed to fall out of our lives completely,
and we've barely talked about him at all. Louise brings him up
occasionally, but both of our gazes involuntarily darken upon impact of
the first syllable of his name, and she shirks back in her chair, afraid
to say any anymore. </p>
<p>I have to have closure about the topic though. It bugs me that she
might still be thinking about him, harboring those old feelings and
keeping them close to her sleeve. When I thought about her pros and cons
two weeks ago, truth be told, he never entered my mind, but he
certainly has here, with a vengeance. </p>
<p>Now though, there's this dark cloud of doubt over my seduction of
her. I eased off a little, feeling as if I was getting too close to her
heart. Paris can break like a toothpick and if I mentioned him, what
would be her reaction? We were dancing together, in each other's arms,
and that was something I wasn't ready to lose so quickly. Her fingers
twined against my back, and I felt like I fit within her short form
perfectly. </p>
<p>As the hours wore on and the contestants thinned out (don't ask
Paris or I how we managed to stay in), the music went from stubborn
all-40s to filter into 50s rock and a little 80s music inspired by 50s
rock. Miss Patty had somehow convinced Taylor that playing his records
over and over again would wear the crowd out, so he decided to appease
her and open up the playlist a little more. That meant we got to dance
along to a few modern hits, which kept us on our toes. Just as we were
getting used to that <i>Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy</i> song, Paris and I
had to switch gears and move onto grooving to some more calm ballads,
like you'd hear in those <i>Love Story</i>-type movies from the 60s. </p>
<p>The hours wore on, and though we had a couple of breaks at noon and
6pm, I could tell that she was starting to buckle under the pressure.
Paris was feeling sort of woozy at times, and I had to scream for a
volunteer to deliver me a cup of water so I could splash it in her face
and shock her back into the competition. We were also losing ahold of
trying to avoid the tough questions. </p>
<p>See, after she asked me about Dean and whether we were back together
and saw how unhinged I got, I was afraid to bring up the topic of the
boy we fought over for the year he was in both our sights. Tristan
remained a very little broached topic between both of us, and when I've
tried, she tries to bring me right back into something else. </p>
<p>An example of that; During a quiet night in Washington in the dorm
room we had a conversation out of boredom (it was that or watching the
Orioles game on TV, and we both could care less about baseball). We were
doing fine, talking about our childhoods without getting too deep
within the angst of our individual situations; Paris with her genius
starting to shine through and her parents fighting about her potential,
and I with starting school and having the stigma going in of being a
product of a teenaged mother. We went around those topics and talked
about our happiest moments and funniest stories, just having a fun time
all along. </p>
<p>Then I remembered the time she told me about the kiss on a dare
Tristan gave her sometime in eighth grade when we chatted somewhat
sort-of friendly at the Bangles concert. I thought it might be fun to
compare our first kisses, so I told her about mine with Dean and how I
thought it was wonderful back then. All the time of course, looking at
her own pink lips and wondering how a first kiss with a girl might feel
like. She laughed at how I stole a box of Argo accidentally fleeing from
the scene and the comedy of errors that resulted from trying to hide
it. </p>
<p><i>She likes hearing about it,</i> I thought to myself. So when I
finished telling my story, I eased right in. </p>
<p>"So Par, how did the kiss with Tristan come about?" Neutral,
unaffected, at a high point, I thought it would work out well. But
remember the conference room fight? It was a little less brutal than
that. </p>
<p>She got this white look, and opened her mouth wide, struggling to
come up with something to say, or avoid my query. Her lip sort of
trembled, and it was then I knew I hit a sore spot. </p>
<p>"Uhhh, I need to run to 7-Eleven, we're awfully low on soda and
gum," she mumbled as she abruptly got up from the bed, looking for her
jacket. </p>
<p>"But it's ten o'clock at night, you don't know what's out there--" I
said, ceding that the talk was done, but still concerned for her
welfare. </p>
<p>"I have pepper spray!" she snapped out, and before I could stop her,
she was out the door and gone, leaving me there alone. Once again,
Tristan put the brakes on getting to each other more, and it took a
couple more days of 'I'm sorry's and 'Let's just have some fun's before
I got back into Paris' good graces again. </p>
<p>It was now about 7:30 on the dance floor, and I could hear her start
to complain, mumbling about what a bad DJ Taylor was and how sore her
feet were. My casual shoes seemed to be working fine, but she had
miscalculated on her shoe choice, going with slightly high red heels she
thought could make it 24 hours, but didn't even get through hour
fourteen. </p>
<p>I tried to start soothing her, massaging her back with my hands as
we danced, dancing closer to her, talking her through the history of the
marathon and other things. I even started an impromptu mind-meeting
session, going over from memory the notes in my head for one of our
classes, because we both had premonitions that Mr. Mercurio was planning
to spring a three-page popper on us first thing Monday morning to keep
those of us slogging through <i>War and Peace</i> on our toes. Nothing
seemed to work however, and her muscles tightened in my grasp. </p>
<p>"Rory," she groaned, fingers tight on my wrist. "Are you feeling
tired yet?" This despite at least three cups of heavily caffeinated
wintergreen tea going through her system at the time. </p>
<p>"No, not at all," I said with a smile. "Why, are you ready to give
up and let Kirk win?" My streak of mischief was intended to bring Paris
around, and once again, wake her up. </p>
<p>"Of course not, I'm just not used to being in a situation like this
on a Saturday. Usually, I'm snoozing my way through temple because my
rabbi is so dull." She laughed wryly, and I couldn't help but do the
same. </p>
<p>"Father Daniels can be that way too, only it's on a Sunday," I
commented back. "But at least it's good cardiovascular activity." </p>
<p>As I said that, her hands moved down to where my love handles would
be if I wasn't already slim, and suddenly her mood seemed to brighten
considerably. She got this dreamy little smile on her face, and Paris
went into this sudden mode I never saw her in before. </p>
<p>"There are other wonderful ways to work out the heart," she reminded
me, her voice cooing...I never thought she could coo, she was Miss
Monotone all the time. "Some of them very sacrilegious in execution." </p>
<p>It was then the music changed over to the beat of a tango, just the
kind of opening I had been looking for. However, Kirk and his partner
had beat everyone to center court and started their exhibition, and
Paris' sudden words stunned me too much to help draw us both into that
same showcase position. Which was all good and well, since we moved to a
far corner while everyone hooted and hollered at the 'sure thing'
couple of the tournament. Better to be the dark horses and just win on
good old-fashioned endurance than trying to overimpress. </p>
<p>"I didn't think you had it in you Gellar, go you with the Bible
references!" I laughed and brought her closer. </p>
<p>"I have a million of 'em." She seemed to be getting more
comfortable, and though she was still a little grumpy, she wasn't ready
to take off my head. </p>
<p>Though a few moments later, I'd be regretting bringing that up. </p>
<p>"Figures, being around Tristan and all," I said offhand, thinking
that the conversation would remain relaxed. However, once I said his
name, she seemed shocked again and things were starting to resemble the
same thing that happened when I tried to bring him up in Washington, she
was horrified. </p>
<p>"Damn it, Tristan isn't that bad," she said to me firmly. "I don't
care if you hate him, he was in my life for twelve years and we depended
on each other, he was more than the frat boy he was around you!" </p>
<p>"I didn't say anything mean about him, I'm sorry--" I started
panicking as I felt her grip on my waist fade. </p>
<p>"Save it, please, I don't want to talk about him." She gritted her
teeth, and it was then I knew I hit a trouble spot, just like her
mother. </p>
<p>"But you asked me about Dean earlier and I thought that it would be
fine to talk about Tristan, we've barely talked about him since he
left!" The music was blaring over the system, covering up our argument,
or lack of it after she brought her dancing down to a slow shimmy, only
a couple fingers in my hand. </p>
<p><i>She's not going to run away, please God, no!</i> I wasn't even
thinking of the dance; I hated when Paris averted something I brought
up. </p>
<p>"I want my yellow card!" She told me firmly, without hesitation.
"Get it out of your pocket Gilmore, I need some air!" </p>
<p>"But you'll need that for later, for an emergency..." I tried
reasoning with her, but she was firm. </p>
<p>"I need some space, ten minutes away might calm me down." I looked
into her eyes, and she pleaded with me for the card. She seemed to be
angry, but yet, sad. Her doey eyes were forlorn, and I could tell
through them that she still cared for Tristan, even a year after. </p>
<p>After a little hesitiation, I handed her the card, and we danced
towards the judge's stand to hand it to Taylor. I could get my own ten
minute sit from it, and maybe she was right, we needed some space. </p>
<p>"Ten minutes Taylor, I have to use the restroom and massage my
feet," she yelled at him, and he nodded as he took the piece of paper
and called me over to the sidelines. We walked towards the bleachers,
and I held her hand tight, wondering if this was the last time Paris and
I would be so close together. I sat down, and let her go, but before I
did, I looked into her eyes, giving her a face that told her that
whenever she was ready to let go, I would be there for her, open to any
conversation. </p>
<p>She looked down, and I pleaded with her to use the ten minutes
wisely. "Paris," I said, numb. "You'll be back, right?" Something right
out of a novel. </p>
<p>Paris stared at me, and I thought I saw the beginning of a tear
form. I might have been seeing things though, because I was focusing on
her words more. "I can't promise anything Rory. If I'm not," her voice
was strained and cracked, "I'm sorry." </p>
<p>And then, she left me, sitting alone on these bleachers. I watched
her walk away from me and towards the front doors of the gym, unreadable
through the swell of the dancing crowd, still about 100 couples strong.
The door opened, and as she walked out, fate was the only thing guiding
both of us again. </p>
<p>I brought my gaze to my hands, only minutes before held by the
blonde girl. I can remember from memory her slim fingers wrapped around
mine, and I feel a sense of disappointment swell over me. </p>
<p>I've failed her, and myself. She still has a large space in her
heart for Tristan, and there's nothing I can ever do to overcome that.
I've started to feel like I've misread every signal over the last month,
and that I'll be stuck never letting these feelings out. I don't hate
Tristan, but he's not my kind of lover. Too aggressive and cocky, and
with an attitude that makes me sour. Paris can be acidic, but when
she's nice... </p>
<p>Damn it, she can be really nice. As I sit here watching the minutes
tick away, I can only hope I see her walk back through those doors at
the end of the gym at 7:47pm and 23 seconds so she knows I didn't mean a
thing bringing Tristan up except wanting some meaningful
conversation... </p>

<h4> Paris' POV, 7:52pm</h4>

<p>My mother has from the age of three always to not show your hand, any
sign of weakness when you run into a spot of trouble, no matter how
things may turn out in the end. Sometimes the advice has turned out to
be sterling, no skin off my hide and I didn't fold under the pressure, a
few of my younger meetings with Francine Jarvis in the schoolyard of
Chilton Country Day showed that I was the strong one coming out of it
all. </p>
<p>Running out of that gymnasium a few minutes ago, however, that was a
huge fucking bluff. I didn't have a good hand to make a big deal out of
Rory bringing up the boy who's caused so much bad blood between us,
Tristan. There was no reason at all to pull out my yellow card and take
ten minutes away from her, or worse...forfeiting. Just thinking that in
my mind, it's a curse word, it has the same venom to my brain as a few
other choice words in the English vocabulary. </p>
<p>Paris Gellar was forfeiting her chance to romance and woo Rory
Gilmore. She was forfeiting that gaggle of tingles from Rory's
fingertips that was running through her system like Millstone Nuclear in
the heart of the dog days of summer because she's a chicken. </p>
<p>She also ran all the way out of the gym and into the nearest empty
restroom to start sniffling before anyone could see her at her weakest
point in the seduction. </p>
<p>That's right, I cried. It wasn't that much, just a few shed tears,
but as I shut that door, I let myself cry because I knew from the moment
Rory handed me that yellow card, I was wrong, heartbreakingly wrong
about her intentions. If it was clear my sense of humor had been
darkened and frayed by years under the influence of Sharon Gellar,
there's Exhibit A for you right there; me taking Rory's joke the worst
way I could. </p>
<p>I could never admit defeat though; as my mother says, 'Gellars never
admit defeat'. </p>
<p>Yeah, this coming from a bottle blonde and former secretary named
Sharon Martinez-DeBartolo from a working class clan in Uniondale, New
York, and who moved to Hartford in her teens thanks to her mother
striking it lucky with one of the males of Hartford society. She became
a Gellar only through marriage with my father, and the only thing she
does is file her nails all day while sending money to her retired
parents in Florida. Alimony's been a pain in my father's ass, and it
takes almost Colombian-quality smuggling techniques to even get a gift
from him through the Manor, Mother, and into my bedroom. Take the money
and run, but wreck the daughter's hard-earned stuff, that's been my
mom's attitude since the divorce went through. </p>
<p>Funny I never heard the defeat line from my father. Probably because
he fought tooth and nail for any shred of reputation he could wring out
of Mother before he had to give up. </p>
<p>But she's right; I wasn't going to admit defeat about getting that
far in the dance marathon. When it came to the goal of gaining Rory's
love through it though...I felt ready to cry uncle and give up. </p>
<p>I looked at myself in front of the sink in the mirror, wondering how
I could've gone from carefree to bitch faster than my Porsche on a
straight Iowa farmroad. She was just joking about Tristan and his habit
of calling her Mary. Why did I take it so personally? What triggered
within me to lash out at her like that and tell Rory to shut up and not
bring him up again. </p>
<p>Truth be told, I miss him terribly, every day. He made my life
interesting, a presence in it just about every day since I was three and
we met in preschool. I grew to love him since he was the main
dependable boy in my life. I couldn't help it that by the time I turned
13 and discovered the opposite sex, he became an obsession on par with
that of my academics. </p>
<p>Yes, everyday I don't see him at locker 1832, since he left last
November, my heart has been hollow in a certain place. But I can tell
you with certainty that place is where only friendly feelings lurk, the
place where that one special other in your life, that first, lived for a
long time. Then one day, it's yanked out without warning because two
inept jackasses convince that first special other it would be fun to
commit burglary. </p>
<p>But you know what? Rory's taken the place entirely where his love
used to be. Absence, instead of making my heart grow fonder of DuGrey,
drew me closer to my former enemy, and vice-president, and I feel a
connection with her I never have with Tristan. Her kindness, loyalty,
trust and her spirit, Rory could have given up on me the second I told
her to get away from me after she broke the ice...literally with her
flying body into my castle project. But she stayed persistent, and even
through force and many, many threats to bring her down, she still finds
something to like about me. Something that was enough to get me in this
farmtown gym and participate in a glorified hoedown with her. </p>
<p>Yet I still fumble the opportunity. Here, you wonder why my
psychiatrist billed double when I was in therapy after the parental shit
went down, Melfi and Soprano don't have anything on Dr. Judy Birnbaum
and me! </p>
<p>I stood there, looking at what I had become in that mirror. I was
supposed to be making her numb with desire, help her forget her worries,
and instead I was in front of a mirror, watching myself cry and ruin my
makeup somewhat in that hot little number that was turning many heads,
including a certain brunette's. </p>
<p>"Why do you always screw things up?" I whispered to my mirror image.
I said some things, admonishing myself for my behavior and giving
MirrorParis a dressing down on par with some drill sergeants. "Who the
hell are you, you have a girl ready to break down in that gym from your
cop out, and all you can think to do is throw yourself a pity party?
Come on, this isn't what the usual Paris would do, she would be on that
floor heating things up, and kissing the everlasting life out of her!" </p>
<p>My conscience decided it was perfect time to chime in. <i>OK Par,
you're just going to walk out on Rory without any explanation about how
Tristan still sort of effects you, but only as a friend? Come on, you
can't get out of here, you might as well wear a hood on Monday and run
chickenshit away from her each time she asks for an explanation. You
love her, you think nothing of her! If it wasn't for your more reserved
side, you would've screamed 'YES!' after she asked you on Wednesday from
the top of Travelers Tower! For the smartest fucking girl in all of
Central Connecticut you sure don't have a clue when it comes to earning
love...</i> </p>
<p>"But I do," I cried to myself, "I do like her, maybe even love her.
I like Rory Gilmore goddamn it!" I felt at my weakest, crying into that
mirror with an audience of just myself, knowing that the security of
that restroom might have kept that secret. "But I don't know if can deal
with it. This town, my social class, Chilton, Harvard, most of all my
family what would they say? What would Rory say if I even insinuated I
might have more than friendly feelings for her?" </p>
<p>"Dear, you won't know until you get the courage to rise up and go
through with telling her that." </p>
<p>"I know, but..." Wait, that didn't sound like my dialogue, spoken or
thought in my brain. That wasn't even my tone of voice. My eyes were
transfixed to the mirror image, and it took a two-inch movement of my
pupils to the left before I knew that there was another member of the
audience. An older Latina woman of about 55 stood behind me in my
gaze... </p>
<p>"Ms. LaCosta?" I stayed focused in the mirror, every part of my body
paralyzed in fear. The woman who had saved my academic hide last year in
renting out the hall to me for the project, and who was currently
judging this competition, had come in unnoticed as I ranted on to myself
about my state with Rory. </p>
<p>She knew <b>everything</b>; Miss Patty knew my secret, and the
shame that was following me around just by keeping it to myself. <i>Oh
God, no! </i>I thought in a panic, there was no way I could just shrug
it all off as a joke or some kind of idiotic Method acting exercise. I
was out in her eyes, confessing my want for Rory to a bathroom mirror,
and unwittingly, her. </p>
<p>"Hello Paris," she started, seemingly unaffected. "I just came in
here to ask what the matter was; you ran out of the gym awfully
quickly." </p>
<p>I wanted to tell her that Rory said something wrong and I reacted
the wrong way, but my acidic self put up my usual walls. "What do you
care, I don't even live here, you have no reason to be concerned about
me. I'm fine." </p>
<p>I saw her come closer towards me in the mirror, her flowery robe and
bright dress apparent in the light, along with her face, worn by many a
South Florida season. "You left Rory in the gym awfully worried and it
seemed so abrupt, so it seemed natural for me to come in and try to
soothe you." </p>
<p>"Well you can't," I said bitterly. "I suppose I should leave before
you hop on your cell phone and spread the fact I have feelings for your
golden daughter that go beyond those of a Midol ad scenario throughout
the entire ZIP code. If you want a photo for the trashy story you'll
have printed about me in the <i>Gazette</i> I'll go into my glove box
and retrieve one." A little bitter, don't you think? </p>
<p>Where if this was Hartford she may have gone through with not only
that spoken threat, but created an entire past untrue sexual history,
instead Ms. LaCosta came even closer. She was still smiling, and it was
unsettling. My mouth dropped as I realized her proximity to me. Instead
of slapping me like the insolent young woman I was acting like though,
she put her hands on my shoulders. </p>
<p>"Turn around dear," she asked. </p>
<p>"No, I don't have to Ms. LaCosta," I stated firmly. Maybe she'd go
away if I didn't face her eye to eye. </p>
<p>However, she stayed stubborn. "You have that right in this nation,
along with the right to pursue your form of happiness. When I landed at
Ismoralda in '65 on a raft from Cardenas that was the one thing I came
to America for; to be happy. If you feel happy with Rory, no one can
tell you otherwise, and I'm certainly not going to because it is your
life Paris." </p>
<p>I sighed, she wasn't going to be mean to me and fight my fire with
fire, I had to concede she'd shoot down my brimstone with rainbows. "But
I'm not supposed to be this way, and I'm sure that if I was back in the
actual 40's, you sure wouldn't be as open to this as you are now.
You've heard too much, and I'm honestly unsure if I can trust you with
what was uttered to this mirror." </p>
<p>"You're right," she accepted, "you don't know if I'll go out there,
get on the microphone and shout out that scenario of dread planted
within your mind right now." She then turned me around, finally. "You
also don't know though that I see through your bitter front, and inside,
I see someone inside who resembles a raven-haired young mother who came
here in October of 1985 with a one year-old in tow, looking to flee
from her confining life and creating a new and free life for that
toddler and her. That same girl kept her child a secret from everyone in
this town except I and the owner of the Inn for at least three months,
because she came to me looking for some kind of job, any job that would
keep her and a child from having to move to a tenement garden in
Hartford in shame." </p>
<p>I then brought my gaze up towards Ms. LaCosta, never realizing until
then that despite the seemingly unconnected threads of Lorelai's first
year in Stars Hollow and my current state, we had many parallels. "This
girl was smart as a whip, could have easily gotten into any college she
wanted to, and hid her secret life from her parents as long as she
could. When everything went down, she gave it all up, the money, the
guarantees, the high life, to become a maid in a small-town inn. She was
ashamed of it at first, scared to show everyone that she was doing this
as more than a Christmas-saving job, but as a lifeline for her and her
child. But then, eventually she knew she had to come out and state that
she was a teenager with a daughter. That day was Christmas 1985, and
though she went into that town holiday party thinking she'd be run out
with a pitchfork for bringing her child around and taking the few gifts
that Mia and I gave her, you know who told her she was a bad role
model?" </p>
<p>"Who?" I responded, albeit knowing the ending already. </p>
<p>"If they did we either didn't hear them or never were there to
condemn her." She smiled into the mirror and ran her fingers through my
scalp. "Hon, this town has seen so much over the years, marriages,
deaths and scandals, the occasional crime that draws the news crews out
to tell us small towns are going down the tubes. But I can tell you
right now, that if Rory is more than a friend to you, you shouldn't stop
yourself from telling her that just because other external factors stop
you." </p>
<p>"How much did you hear by the way?" I finally wondered. </p>
<p>"Just enough," she told me. "But enough to tell me that you want her
in your life, even if she might reject you. You came here just for her
dear, didn't you?" </p>
<p>I nodded. "I was surprised when she asked me to be here since I
haven't really danced in six years, and the fact that well...I'm wearing
a dress, same as her." I finally started calming down, became less
uptight and was able to laugh at myself. </p>
<p>"Yet look at you." She had me turn back around in the mirror and
look at myself. "You look wonderful, you've managed to stay on your feet
for at least 13 1/2 hours and until just a few minutes ago, you were
giddy with excitement, what happened?" </p>
<p>"Tristan did," I said bitterly. "You know, that boy who came in and
out of the play last year? She mentioned him in jest and I went
ballistic, throwing my yellow card at Taylor and fleeing." </p>
<p>"The fine specimen of male?" Ms. LaCosta got this look of
astonishment on her face; sort of a eureka moment. "If I was forty years
younger, he would be on my shopping list!" </p>
<p>There went my red face again; the lady sure knows how to call the
guys. "For a long time I felt that way too, that he was the only one
meant for me. Then he got into trouble just before the play, ended up in
military school in North Carolina, and then..." I wandered off as she
finished off my sentence. </p>
<p>"Thoughts of yours wandered towards thinking of 'my golden
daughter', as you stated, as more of a friend." </p>
<p>"Took me a while, but by the time we got back to Connecticut in
August, I was stuck thinking of her romantically." How I could be so
candid and trusting with Ms. LaCosta I don't know, but I could feel this
aura around her that she had seen it all, heard it all, maybe done it
all. Hey, she lived on South Beach for God's sake, wouldn't put it past
the woman. "I'm just very, very scared, treading lightly, afraid that
someone's going to find out and that's it, Rory's not going to want to
be around me anymore." My lashes lowered as I looked down at the sink.
"Honestly, every time I've tried to push her away, eventually I beg her
back into my life. Every instance for some inexplicable reason, she
puts up with me and draws herself back into the mess that I am, she
must have a sadomasochistic streak in her to have handled me for this
long." </p>
<p>"You have a true friend then," she said to me, noticing my halter
tie loosening and retightening the knot. "She's stuck with you even when
other girls may have shunned you. Something's nagging her to stay with
you; maybe you have a connection to each other that's even tighter than
that of twin siblings. Whatever it is though, even if she doesn't think
of you in the way you think about her, I can see Rory continue to
support you and be a good friend. She's bad at making enemies, and has
some awkward problems making good friends. It's clear that you, my dear,
are a very abnormal exception to that rule. For whatever you do, no
matter how much you grate at her last nerve, you pull towards her, and
she in turn does the same towards you." </p>
<p>"So I'm not abnormal?" I asked. </p>
<p>"No, but you need to unwind that spring a little, get a little more
daring on the floor, let her know that you mean business. I have to
admit that I've tired of her drama with Dean and Jess, they were part of
a template that seems copied from bad drama. You on the other hand..."
She finished my knot, and with my frown slowly inching towards an
upwards curve, "...will be a challenge to watch, stealing those
glances, trying to wring something out of the innocent. I'm not about to
tell anyone because I want this little secret of yours to age to a fine
vintage, and I just have this small little feeling in the back of my
mind that maybe she's bored with the opposite sex. And if things come
to fruition, you'll be surprised at how well this town might take
things. Because if they don't, I'm not going to stay silent and leave
you to fight alone." </p>
<p>"Honest?" I was still a little unsure, until she turned me around
and offered me her hand to shake. </p>
<p>"An oral contract, that I, Miss Patty, will be there for you if
you're ever in doubt, or you just need a second ear offered for an
opinion." </p>
<p>I felt like by doing this, I might be entering into some wacky
tradition that I might be called on to return a favor for someday. Then
though, it was just something woman-to-woman, a covenant that I could
continue with my secret for as long as I needed to without any pressure.
For all anyone knew, I did really have sore feet and needed to use the
bathroom. </p>
<p>Alright, so after all that wintergreen tea the second part was
needed, but my feet were fine, though I was cursing my choice of heels.
Halfway through, they did hurt like heck, you can see now why I'm a
loafers girl outside of school. </p>
<p>So I asked her for one favor before I decided that yes, I was ready
to explain my sudden mood swing to Rory and get back to creaming Kirk's
ass. </p>
<p>"Ms. LaCosta?" </p>
<p>"It's Miss Patty, we've had a close conversation and I've never been
comfortable with the formal titles." </p>
<p>"Fine, Miss Patty," I corrected myself. "You won't tell Rory we
talked, right? If she were to find out that I was talking about her this
way...I don't think I could face her." I offered out my hand, and she
proffered it. </p>
<p>"You have a deal hon. I wouldn't even think of sharing this because
it's something that's very iffy to spread." We smiled at our
understanding with each other, and though I swore I saw in her eyes she
knew something that I didn't, I wasn't going to call her on it. </p>
<p>I thanked her, and after checking my watch and realizing that it
read 7:46:23, I had to get back into the gym, and fast with only one
minute exactly left. </p>
<p>"I have to go," I told her. "My girl...she's waiting for me out on
the floor." I smiled funny, and nervously looked at Miss Patty. She just
had her own funny smile on her face. "What?" I asked, wondering the
reason as I walked backwards. </p>
<p>"You might want to pay attention Par. You're about to crash into--" </p>
<p>Just then, I felt my ass and head bump up against the doorpost,
giving me a jolt and a nice bruise on top of my skull. I cried in pain
for a bit, and she completed her sentence. </p>
<p>"--The door." She gritted her teeth as the minute started ticking
down. "Better just start running," she then observed. </p>
<p>Of course, that led my gaze to my shoes, and the dress I was
wearing, braless. "In <b>this</b> getup?" </p>
<p>Patty laughed at me and then jolted me back to the situation I was
facing. "Unless you want to stay here, forfeit and see Kirk take home
the trophy." My eyes immediately widened, that was definitely something
I didn't want Rory subject to, again! </p>
<p>"I'm gone, bye!" I opened up the door, and thankful all that
unneeded weight was off my shoulders again, booked it all the way in
those painful shoes 450 feet from the east wing girl's room and back
into the gymnasium, where that damned stubborn Taylor was standing at
the table with his stopwatch at hand, salivating at getting to use his
'Airhorn of Elmination' on me. </p>
<p>Well not so fast there, buster. Rory was sitting on the table,
anxious for my return and looking forlornly out at the crowd. I was
thirteen seconds away from ruining her night. If that didn't swell my
heart to double its usual spiritual size, the sexy little pout on her
face pretty much sealed the deal that I had to make it back over. </p>
<p>I dodged couples in mid-swing or move, 'Pardon me' and 'excuse me
sir, madam'ing my way through the dance floor. Still so close, yet so
far away, I could hear a clock ticking in my head. <i>9, 8, 7, 6...</i> </p>
<p>I had to resort to drastic measures to get back into the
competition. I yelled out her name over the blare of the music, and in
the snap of a finger, she was up like a light, turning her frown upside
down and all that other romantic jazz. Making a long ten-second story
short, we met back at our spot with one second to spare, and I placed my
hand right on her back, dipped her low to the ground, then grabbed her
hand and spun her right back against me, causing a very dramatic
re-entry into this whole thing. She looked into my eyes, with a smile,
and sighed happily. </p>
<p>"I'm back, I'm sorry, and I'm ready to talk," I told her, as we
heard Taylor voice out his frustration over the PA system. </p>
<p>"Damn it, you got in under the wire Miss Gellar!" he yelled at me as
Rory and I found our footing. "I was getting so excited and you had to
go ruin my fun, why did I--" </p>
<p>Andrew, the owner of the local bookstore tapped him on his shoulder.
"Taylor, you're supposed to be impartial and encouraging! Don't say
anything else or else I'm taking over the mic and horns." </p>
<p>Rory and I laughed as we saw him put Taylor in his place, and after
that, the world around us turned foggy as she spoke for the first time
since I left her. </p>
<p>"Hey, you'd get here eventually," she told me. "But I understand
where you were coming from there Par, I'm sorry if I brought up too
much, too fast." She rubbed her free hand on my shoulder, and I quickly
felt any tension left within fading. </p>
<p>"It's OK, we were keeping this in way too long. Tristan doesn't
deserve to be ignored even though he screwed up, and though he was your
personal pain in the ass and my swoon buddy, he made everything
interesting." I sighed as she started listening. "Look, I didn't mean to
go off on you, but since we're getting so close to each other, I
suppose there are some things I should let you know about, clear the air
about a few things." </p>
<p>"Well...alright," she uttered, somewhat nervously. There was
something about her tone of voice that was cluing me in that Rory was
expecting the worst out of what I had to say. That meant I had to use
caring words and emphasis on what I was about to confess. We danced in
each other's arms as she started to lean against me and lend her ear to
me. </p>
<p>"First of all, if you think I'm still mooning over Tristan as that
prince who will someday come on noble steed and bring me back to his
newly acquired kingdom of Raleigh-Durham in a year or so, I'm not, Ror.
I stopped thinking of him as more than a friend at least more than a
year ago and God forbid if he ever came back I don't have plans to
rekindle anything that isn't there. There's no point continuing to
delude myself further since the date you sent us out on sophomore year
made it painfully clear that we were incompatible romantically." </p>
<p>Rory smiled as she heard me say that, and dare I say looked more
relieved than surprised. But that was nothing compared to the heated
curve I was about to throw towards her. <i>You don't have to</i>, my
conscience told me, but I knew that if I wanted to spark this
relationship, I had to be completely honest with her. My hand against
her back for support, I confessed to Rory that certain detail which
happened two weeks before the date. </p>
<p>"By the way, do you remember that party you went to at Madeline's
house the night after you broke up with Dean the first time? Where you
did more recreational reading than dancing and your friend Lane met
Henry?" </p>
<p>"Yeah," she told me, "that was a fun party..." Rory seemed to bite
her lip, cluing me into her second sense about what I was about to say. </p>
<p>"No Gilmore, it wasn't fun, for you or I. I would've rather been
elsewhere honing my vocabulary instead of monitoring Orangina, and the
only reason you were there was to think about something else besides
Dean, all that loud music would hopefully scramble your senses. Tristan
wasn't having a hot time either, what with Summer playing with his heart
like a toy. Both of you were having problems of the heart, and you
somehow came together in the piano room, where after a rash of thefts
of precious antiques from previous parties and some broken glass bells
from Mrs. Lynn's tourism bell collection, Madeline and her mother
decided to install a wireless security camera, which was hidden in a
replica tin sitting on the bookshelf." </p>
<p>She didn't stop dancing, didn't stop me from going on. Rory just
nodded and licked around her lips to recoat them in a nervous manner.
"Okay..." </p>
<p>"As I was saying, you two were hurting, at a party neither of you
wanted to be at in retrospect. You wanted to be at home with a pint of
Häagen-Dazs watching <i>Thelma and Louise</i> while you recounted
to Lorelai how much you wanted to cut off circulation to Dean's pelvis,
while Tristan...well we both know where Tristan wanted to be. So you
find yourselves in the same room together, both of you hurt, and numb.
On the surface having what looked to be a healthy serving of sexual
tension on par with several series on a certain young woman-targeting
television network which shall remain nameless, you still loathed him,
he still had an insatiable crush on you. However, you dropped your
barriers enough to have an awkward conversation about science class or
another class, I don't remember. All I know is that Madeline came up to
me one day asking if I might want to see something on a videotape that
had a perfect view of that piano and the surrounding room. She didn't
say what was on it, just that it would give me ammunition." </p>
<p>I could see her lip get sort of shaky, and her body tighten in my
grasp. So far I had done well setting things up, now I just had to go
through with the rest of the story and hope Rory still respected me. "Go
on," she beckoned with a very shaky and strained voice. </p>
<p>I told her all about what was on the tape, and about how I reacted
to what was on it. At first she had this look of fear to her and it
seemed like in my arms, she was turning white. Rory was scared, and I
tried to make her understand that there was nothing on that tape that
was a surprise to me. I knew Tristan liked her, she didn't, and in the
end once I got to the climax of the film, the kiss, that I didn't feel a
thing. I was emotionally numbed and shocked from what I saw, but there
was no anger that I ever felt. I kept trying to make it clear to her
that the only two people who were at fault that night, were not in that
room. Dean and Summer were both idiots for letting good love pass them
by, and she seemed to understand I didn't hold any bitterness for her
or Tristan at all. </p>
<p>As I finished describing what I had seen on the tape, I felt Rory
relax in my grasp, and saw her color return to her face. I was thankful
that she was taking such a revelation so well, and I had poured my heart
out to her in such a way that made me feel like I could trust her with
a confidant with my own secrets. I tried my best to make sure that this
revelation was the final straw that told her she could trust me with
anything she held close to her heart, including secrets, and I would
not tell them to anyone. </p>
<p>Finishing what I had to say, Rory asked the important question I had
been expecting about the cassette. "Uh, where is this tape you watched
now?" </p>
<p>"Oh, it's currently probably eating the ozone layer above New York
City since I burned it in my home incinerator in front of Madeline and
Louise while I scolded them that if details about your kiss with Tristan
ever got out, they'd be getting some natural blue eyeshadow courtesy of
my fist." I laughed and she finally let out an easy breath. "There
isn't a copy floating out there at all, only the five of us know what
happened in that piano room--" </p>
<p>"Along with my mother," she added. "I kind of panicked about whether
he'd spill about the kiss during the play scenario so I asked her if I
should let Dean know. She told me to keep my mouth shut." </p>
<p>"As well Lorelai should, I didn't need my Romeo carted out to
Hartford General with double broken kneecaps. But honestly, I kinda had
fun seeing you squirm as he hinted about the kiss. He didn't tell me
about it, but I knew what he was talking about the entire time. I did
make him Romeo in a last gasp at saving him from falling deeper with
Duncan and Bowman, but it didn't work, so I'm sorry for that too." </p>
<p>"What about the date though? You said you handled our kiss just
fine, but the setup went too far." She was nervous on that topic, and
had totally called me on that. So I answered her in the most honest way
possible. </p>
<p>"That did bruise my pride, but back then I thought you'd be gone by
the end of the year and I'd never have to see you again. I'm really
sorry for telling you that I hated you for setting me up on the date,
because although I seemed happy coming back into the classroom the
morning after..." I hesitated for a beat, reading her eyes as we swayed
across the floor. Her blues were warm, caring, understanding completely.
"He wanted you Rory, not me. It was a noble attempt to try to make my
dream of dating him come true, but there were no sparks during dinner,
and the movie was spent going over some class notes in my head rather
than gauging the exact moment he'd stretch his arm across my back and
place his hand on my shoulder. The kiss at the end of the night was
just as dull, I didn't feel a thing, a swoon, or a drying of my mouth,
nor any urge to invite him in under the pretense of coffee and offer
myself to him. Everything I did to you after that, until we went onto
our second friends track? I was trying to find a spark with Tristan
again, a reason to try to find something to hate about you." </p>
<p>Then, I closed my eyes and came the closest today to admitting what
I really felt for her, running my hands against the bottom knuckles on
each of her hands. I could hear her breath shallow up, the air around us
start to stiffen. The sounds of a song from the <i>Dirty Dancing</i>
soundtrack played over the loudspeakers, and what minutes ago may have
been another end to a friendship, turned out to end well in my favor, it
finally felt nice to get everything out about what I had thought of
Tristan over the last year. </p>
<p>By this point, my voice had started breaking, and I felt myself
swoon as I pushed the idea of Rory and I together further in our
intimate dancing circle. "Rory, if you hadn't been here for me, to stop
me from going bat crazy over an A- grade or these wacky <i>Franklin</i>
ideas I come up with that are bad in actuality, or going along with me
to become my vice president and just listened to my mother all the time
instead of my heart and gut feelings, I wouldn't be happy at all. I look
at who I was in September two years ago, and I can't believe how much
of a bitch I was to you, no one ever offered to help me with something
they screwed up, be it a project or an assignment, because they were
too scared to even broach the question. You asked anyways, and I
refused. Even after all that and trying to shut you out cold, you stay
with me. You could've become a Puff all alone, but you demanded that I
get in with you or else you wouldn't join at all. Finally, you love to
tease me about being so high-strung and obsessed with tests, being good
natured about it and telling me to ease up. In the end though, no
matter what I've done--" This point in the conversation would be about
where I lost all composure, and softly cried, blinking back tears that
were going to come anyway. "You still like me. I'm still your friend
and you're my best friend. And for that, I'm forever grateful to have
you in my life, Rory Gilmore." With that, I collapsed onto her
shoulder, and just cried like I never did before, joyful tears that
expressed how thankful I was for that small-town brunette right then
and there. </p>
<p>Thank God no one really saw it and we were buried deep in the crowd,
a slow dance was the perfect time to just let it all out. Her hand was
rubbing my upper back, and I heard her soothing voice, telling me
everything was going to be OK and that it was fine to cry. I let myself
go, letting two years of torn emotions, broken and reformed loyalties
and misunderstandings formerly buried, bubble to the surface. I had been
honest with her about Tristan, and in turn she understood. There was no
second-guessing, no questioning, just a smile and a reassuring shoulder
to cry on. We both kept our feet moving, and when I looked towards the
judge's stand, I saw Ms. LaCosta in her chair. She was smiling at me,
and her confidence in Rory forgiving me and listening to my side of the
story was right on target. </p>
<p>There's still about ten hours of this literal song and dance to go,
and I'm in it for the long haul now. If I had to do it again, use my
yellow card to gain a little space and perspective, I wouldn't change a
thing. Because even in my worst moments, Rory's loyalty to me is
unwavering, and through this night that fact is becoming crystal clear. </p>
<p>All I need now is more clarity on whether she likes me further than
she lets on... </p>
