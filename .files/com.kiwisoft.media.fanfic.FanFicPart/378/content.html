<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter One -->

<p>The sun had not yet peeked over the mountains, but Kara hurried anyway. With
			her sketchpad tucked securely under her arm, she picked her way along the trail
			to the lake. Her flashlight shining, she agilely avoided the exposed roots of
			the massive trees lining the path and she paused, leaning against the trunk of
			one of those giants to catch her breath. She had come down this same trail the
			evening before and had sketched the lake at sunset, but she knew the colors of
			early morning would be more to her liking. </p>
		<p>She slowed as she saw the water through the trees. Something caught her eye
			along the edge and through the mist, she saw the shadows of two deer as they
			walked slowly along the fringe of the lake. As if sensing her presence, their
			heads turned her way, and she froze and watched as their ears twitched,
			listening for her next step. They stared at her as she stared back and for
			several seconds she barely took in a breath, not wanting to disturb the scene.
			Finally, with a disinterested toss of their tails, they walked off into the
			trees and disappeared. </p>
		<p>She hurried now as the morning light crept over the hills, and she walked
			nearly to the edge of the lake, sat again on the same rock as before and waited
			for the colors of sunrise to strike her. She shivered in the cool of the morning
			and she rubbed her hands across her bare legs, waiting. </p>
		<p>When the first pinks appeared over the water, her fingers moved quickly,
			nimbly sketching the lake in the dim light of dawn and when the pinks erupted to
			orange, she added more color as the sound of her chalk on paper echoed through
			the silent forest. When the full sun peeked through, changing the brilliant
			orange to dull yellow, she put her pad down and stretched her neck, raising her
			arms over her head. She looked at her work, then picked up another color and
			quickly added the shadows of the deer along the rim. She rarely painted animals
			of any kind, but she wanted to remember the deer, in case she decided to add
			them when she took this to canvas. As an afterthought, she sketched her
			trademark in the top corner, a full moon hanging over the lake, and closed her
			pad. Only then did she hear the footsteps behind her. </p>
		<p>"Good morning. "</p>
		<p>Startled, she turned. She hadn't expected hikers this early and was clearly
			surprised by the older woman standing there watching her. Kara stared at her in
			silence before finding her voice. </p>
		<p>"Hello," she murmured. </p>
		<p>"I didn't want to disturb you earlier. You were so engrossed. I've never seen
			anyone out here this early before. " </p>
		<p>The woman was clearly nervous and Kara took a moment to compose herself. She
			replaced the glare on her face with a forced smile and gathered up her sketchpad
			and chalks, trying to ignore the woman as politely as possible. She had never
			been good with strangers. </p>
		<p>"I'm Louise Harrison, by the way," the woman said, extending her hand. </p>
		<p>Kara looked up and, after a brief pause, touched hands with the woman. "Kara.
			Kara Morgan. "</p>
		<p>"I don't believe I've seen you before. Tourist? "</p>
		<p>"Not exactly. "</p>
		<p>Kara moved to walk past her, but the woman put her hands on her hips, clearly
			expecting an explanation. </p>
		<p>"I'm renting the Dobson cabin," Kara finally explained. </p>
		<p>"The Dobson place? I thought they were only going away for a week or two."</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't know about that," Kara said. "I've rented it through October."</p>
		<p>"Well, I'll be. I wonder what happened? " Louise asked, expecting Kara to
			answer. </p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. She had lived in the city her whole life, she wasn?t used to
			keeping tabs on her neighbors. </p>
		<p>"You're going to be here through October, you say? "</p>
		<p>"Yes. "Kara again tried to pass, but the woman continued. </p>
		<p>"Well, come by the store then. Ginny will be glad to meet you. There's very
			few people her own age out here in the mountains. "</p>
		<p>"Who? " Kara asked. </p>
		<p>"My granddaughter. We have the general store over at the end of town," the
			woman explained, motioning with her hand. </p>
		<p>"Oh. "Kara smiled politely, finally walking past the woman. "Actually, I
			haven't been into town yet. "</p>
		<p>Louise surveyed her sketchpad under her arm. "You're an artist? " </p>
		<p>"Yes. "</p>
		<p>"Hobby? "</p>
		<p>"It started out that way, yes. "</p>
		<p>"Well, you must be good if you can make a living at it. "</p>
		<p>"Sometimes. "Kara squared her shoulders, raising to her full height. She?d
			had enough of idle conversation for one day. "Listen, it was nice to meet you,
			but I've got to get back. Louise, was it? "</p>
		<p>"Yes. Come by the store," she said again. "We've got coffee," she called to
			Kara?s retreating back. </p>
		<p>Kara smiled slightly and made her escape, hurrying back along the path to her
			truck, anxious to return to her solitude. </p>
