<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - Ghosts And Camels -->

<p>Brooke sat on Sam's bed in the dark, knees drawn up to her chest crying. It
was a familiar pattern. She had spent most of her time in a similar fashion in
the three weeks Sam had been gone. No one, not Nicole, her father or Jane, Mary
Cherry, Sugar, Josh or Lily had been able to coax the poor girl out of her
self-imposed coccoon. </p>
<p>She had gotten somehow impossibly thinner; refusing-absolutely, catagorically
to eat unless forced and would not go back to the Eating Disorder Clinic. She'd
refused that too, verbally, physically, loudly and viciously. Mike had never
seen such behavior from his daughter before, she no longer acted or looked like
the little girl he raised. </p>
<p>Her natural grace was gone, replaced by movements that were forced, awkward
and stiff. The friendly, easy going girl had disappeared and in her place was a
rude, brooding emotionless machine that never smiled. Her normally glowing
complexion was now waxy pale with deep circles under her eyes and shadows
accentuated her already highlighted cheekbones. Her once luxurious blonde hair
was now only a pale yellow with none of the lift or vitality it once had. And
what was worse than all of that, were her eyes. It is said that the eyes are the
windows to the soul but anyone looking into the formally brilliant, intellegent,
sparkling hazel eyes of Brooke McQueen would see only one thing- Brooke
McQueen's soul no longer resided within. It had left the same day Sam McPherson
did. </p>
<p>So she showed no outward signs of reacting when she heard a car door slam
followed by the opening and closing of the front door. </p>
<p>(Jane must be home from work early) </p>
<p>She ignored the way the hair on the back of her neck stood on end. </p>
<p>(Must be a storm rolling in) </p>
<p>She listened to the hurried footfalls on the stairs but chalked it up to
imagination. It wasn't until the door nearly flew off its hinges that she
realized that the sound was real. </p>
<p>There stood the storm in question, Sam, in a pair of jeans and a baggy
t-shirt, her hair a few inches shorter and looking thinner herself. But there
she stood in the flesh. And anyone who saw her would be able to describe her
with one word: furious. Her normally brown eyes were almost red with fury and
her entire body shook from barely surpressed emotion. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke squeaked, her voice catching on the one note. Sam focused on
her with an almost feral intensity. Any urge Brooke had to leap over and hold
the girl in the doorway was effectively crushed by the look on Sam's face. She
had never seen the journalist so upset, upset with her before. And given their
less than happy history, that was saying a lot. </p>
<p>"What the Hell game are you playing at, McQueen?" Sam asked, her badly missed
voice coming out more as a growl. Brooke shrugged mutely, unable to keep Sam's
heated gaze and curled up into a tighter ball. </p>
<p>"Do you know what it's like to get a phone call from Mom telling me that
you're slowly killing yourself? Jesus, Brooke," Sam spat angrily before she
could stop herself. Brooke hid her head behind her arms and started to cry
harder. </p>
<p>Sam sighed to herself. (Gee, Sam, nice job. Make her feel worse, why don't
you? This is so not going well) She hadn't meant to yell but she's been so
scared about what Brooke was doing to herself after she spoke to her mother on
the phone the day before. And then she saw how Brooke actually looked. She
reminded Sam of a Humane Society puppy, lost, malnourished and about to be put
down when all it really needed was love. And she had done this to Brooke. She
silently cursed herself for her cowardly behavior, then Mike for setting them up
like dominos to fall over. She took a deep breath to calm herself and cautiously
approached the bed. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" she whispered in a calmer voice. No response. "Brooke, please look
at me." Still, Brooke didn't respond. "I'm sorry I yelled like that. I didn't
mean to, I'm just worried." This won her a long sniffle from the emaciated
cheerleader. Sam sat on the edge of the bed. "Look, I can leave and come back in
if you want but all I really wanted was to say `Hi'." </p>
<p>Brooke lifted her head and fixed her tear-filled, bloodshot eyes on Sam. With
a thin trembling hand, she reached out and poked Sam in the shoulder. </p>
<p>"Real?" she hiccuped. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"As a heart attack, babe," at which point Brooke launched herself into Sam's
embrace and sobbed uncontrollably. "Shhh.take it easy before you hurt yourself,"
Sam soothed. Brooke just held on for all she was worth. Sam could feel nearly
every bone in Brooke's body through both their clothes and it scared her. </p>
<p>"God, Brooke, you're so thin. Why do you do this to yourself?" she asked as
her own tears raced down her face. Brooke tried to pull away but Sam held on
tight. </p>
<p>"No, don't pull away from me. I didn't come all the way home to have you pull
away from me and shut me out." </p>
<p>"Why did you come home?" Brooke asked as she settled into Sam's arms and
played with the damp collar of Sam's t-shirt. </p>
<p>"Mom called and said you weren't eating. She figured since no one else could
get through to you, she'd better call in the big gun, me. So I came back. Now
stop evading the question, why do you do this to yourself? God knows you were
thin enough already. Actually, you could have stood to gain a little, Skinny
Minnie," Sam joked lightly. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know. I just haven't been hungry. Food tastes funny lately," she
answered lamely. </p>
<p>"Look, you have four jobs, responsibilities to stay alive in this life: eat,
sleep, breathe, and love me. They're not hard, although I know that last one can
be at times." This got her a small smile from Brooke. "But why do you do this to
yourself and more importantly, why do you do this to me?" Sam finished as new
tears slipped down her face and her voice faded away. Brooke frowned in
confusion. </p>
<p>"'Do this to you'? This isn't about you," she argued hotly. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"In a way, yes it is. You're seeking to control something, anything because
you feel like you're out of control. Mike went totally ballistic when he found
out about us and for once in your life you didn't get your own way. There was
nothing you could do to stop the downward spiral we somehow found ourselves on.
Then you saw how it was threatening to destroy his and Mom's relationship and
neither of us wanted that but nothing we did helped that either. And then I took
away the one safe and secure thing you had left, me. I didn't realize it at the
time, I was only trying to make things better. But you were drowning and I took
away your life preserver. I am so sorry." </p>
<p>"That's still all me," Brooke pointed out. </p>
<p>"Until you factor in the fact that whether it was conscious or not, you knew
that if you pulled this anorexia thing, someone would eventually call me and I'd
come running like a dog when you yank its chain." </p>
<p>"This isn't an `anorexia thing', Sam. It's a disease, like cancer, AIDS, or
alcoholism. And you have a pretty poor opinion of yourself if you think of
yourself as a dog on a chain," Brooke hissed. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"If the analogy fits." she trailed off at the glare she got from her irate
girlfriend. "And I know it's a disease, Brooke. I was in no way belittling it,
or you. But you did this, on some level, to get back at your dad for his Puritan
reaction to us and to get back at me for leaving you. And that hurts," Sam said,
her voice showing exactly how much. </p>
<p>If Brooke didn't feel bad enough already, that comment just about finished
her off. She hadn't meant to hurt Sam, really, she had just hurt so badly
herself that she was acting out the only way she really knew how. And, yes, the
vindictive, meanspirited part of her knew how much starving herself would hurt
her father and she wanted nothing more than to make him suffer as much as she
was suffering. </p>
<p>It was also the only real way she had of expressing the deep emotional pain
she was in. Crying wasn't doing it; it only made her tired and her eyes raw.
Screaming was a waste of energy and while she toyed with the idea of cutting,
her vanity, such as it was, wouldn't let her take the chance of accidentily
scarring herself. So she reverted back to form, her one vice and disorder,
anorexia. </p>
<p>"I never meant to hurt you, Sammy," she sobbed, clinging to Sam desperately.
Sam kissed the top of her head and smoothed her hair down. </p>
<p>"I know that, Brooke. I know. I'm here now and this is going to stop," Sam
said confidently. She brought Brooke's face up for a kiss full of longing,
regret, love and promise. Instantly Brooke began to feel better. Sam got up off
the bed and smoothed her shirt. </p>
<p>"OK, McQueen, here's the deal. Take a shower, because, as much as I love you,
you smell like an unwashed camel in the Sahara at high noon in the middle of
August," Brooke scrunched her nose at the imagery and then sniffed her shirt.
</p>
<p>(Ew, she's right!) </p>
<p>"Then," Sam continued with a smile as she watched Brooke's actions. "By the
time you're done, I'll have your bags packed and we can get the Hell out of
Dodge City." </p>
<p>Brooke was now pressed up against the headboard again, her eyes full of anger
and betrayal. Sam frowned at her confused. </p>
<p>"What?" Brooke's eyes narrowed and turned to ice. </p>
<p>"I am not going back to the Clinic and not even YOU can make me," she growled
in a barely recognizable voice. Sam looked at her, surprised at the amount of
venom that was just spewed in her direction. Brooke sounded like a cat whose
tail was caught in the door. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I know that, Brooke," she said softly. "And as much as I wish you would go,
I'll never make you do something you don't want to." Brooke visibly relaxed. Sam
leaned over the bed putting her arms down to support her weight and making it so
she was nose to nose with Brooke. </p>
<p>"No, I know you won't go to the Clinic. But you can't stay here and fade
away. I won't allow it. So you and me, love, are going on a road trip." Brooke's
eyes got wide. </p>
<p>"What about my Dad?" Sam rolled her eyes and huffed. </p>
<p>"The Nazi?" Sam grinned. Brooke nodded. Sam kissed the end of her nose making
her giggle. "I cleared this with Mom. She'll deflect him, run interference and
any other sports reference I don't know or care to understand." Brooke pulled
her into another fierce hug. </p>
<p>"I missed you so much. Don't ever leave me again, Sammy," she begged. Sam
hugged her back. </p>
<p>"I missed you too, Brooke. And I promise I won't ever leave again. Ever.
Nothing short of death will ever make me leave your side again." </p>
<p>"Don't talk about things like that," Brooke asked. "What are we going to do
about school?" </p>
<p>"You and me are officially on sabbatical. Mom's gonna deal with it. Now stop
worrying so much and go scrub up." </p>
