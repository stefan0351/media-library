<p>Merry Christmas everyone! Enjoy...</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter VII</b></p>
<p>The air smelled of snow, but they hadn't had a white Christmas in years and no one was expecting this year to be any different. It was nevertheless jarringly cold and the grass and dirt underfoot were stiff from the freeze that wouldn't let up. The sun was just dipping below the horizon, its remaining light muddled and blocked by a haze of grey clouds. But the mood inside the car was festive, with Christmas music blaring from the speakers and everyone's mind on the upcoming feast. Because the old truck had no heater and no backseat, Richard had offered to drive and for once not even Miley had complained.</p>
<p>It was a short drive to their destination and before long Richard pulled into the driveway of the largest house in Crowley Corners. Miley was, as always, the first one out of the car and racing towards the front door. Susan walked around to the trunk to gather their things, shouting after her daughter.</p>
<p>"Miley, come help carry some of this."</p>
<p>"I can't, Momma, I'm crippled," yelled Miley, bouncing her crutches on the ground for emphasis.</p>
<p>Susan rolled her eyes, though had to concede. Watching Miley flit across the frozen grass and driveway, however, instilled some worry in her. "Well, go slow so you don't become more crippled."</p>
<p>Miley grinned, but dutifully slowed her pace. It was Christmas, after all. She rang the doorbell and the door was opened almost immediately. Lilly had practically been waiting by the front door, when she wasn't being forced into kitchen slave labor by her mom, and was just as excited as Miley to see her girlfriend.</p>
<p>It was cold outside and Miley's cheeks and nose were red, but she was grinning brightly. She wore a blue beanie on her head, her long, wavy hair falling around her shoulders and Lilly thought she looked absolutely adorable. Miley made her way up the few front steps and leaned forward on her crutches until her lips met Lilly's.</p>
<p>"Miley, not in the doorway, it's freezing out here."</p>
<p>Both girls turned to see Susan right behind her daughter, carrying several containers, Richard and Grandma Ruby following her. Lilly moved back sheepishly and let them enter. The Truscott's home was tastefully decorated with Christmas dÃ©cor, including a huge tree in a corner of the living room. Lilly's mother, Heather Truscott, emerge from the kitchen to greet her guests.</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas, everyone. Susan, I'm glad you could make it. Let's get everything in the kitchen. Oh, Richard, Alan is out in the garage, doing God knows what." Heather took the bags he was carrying, practically telling him to go find her husband, while the three women went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Lilly nodded towards the staircase, to tell Miley to go up to her room. Miley grinned and nodded, not hesitating to escape from potential work. Lilly took one of her crutches so she could climb the staircase more easily and went to poke her head into the kitchen. Grandma Ruby was sitting down at the table, while Susan and her own mom were standing by the counter talking. She wasn't sure when exactly their two mothers had become friends, but she was definitely happy about it, since it meant more time spent with Miley.</p>
<p>"Mom, you don't need us for anything, right? Miley and I are gonna go upstairs," said Lilly, hoping she was done cutting and slicing for the night.</p>
<p>Heather and Susan glanced at each other, than all-knowing motherly smirk on their faces, before Heather turned to her daughter. "No, honey, you guys can go upstairs. But leave the door open."</p>
<p>Lilly wanted to roll her eyes at her mother's insinuation, but considering the woman was right, she let it be. Before she could follow Miley, however, Susan stopped her. "Oh, Lilly, Miley's got some homework to do. She said she'd ask to use your computer, but I'm sure it will slip her mind, so if you could be so kind and take it upstairs for her."</p>
<p>Susan pointed at the bags they had brought and Lilly went to grab the papers. She frowned. "Homework on Christmas Eve? Isn't that cruel and unusual punishment?"</p>
<p>"Very much so. Perhaps next time she will think twice before slacking off," said Susan simply, already returning to her work.</p>
<p>Lilly grabbed the homework and left before they thought of something for her to do. When she got to her room, Miley was already sprawled out on her bed, her remaining crutch thrown by the doorway. Miley grinned and patted the bed next to her.</p>
<p>"Come on, Lils, let's celebrate Christmas."</p>
<p>"Mom told me to leave the door open," said Lilly and sat on the end of the bed by Miley's feet.</p>
<p>"I can be quiet."</p>
<p>Lilly smirked and looked at her girlfriend. "You cannot."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, knowing Lilly was right. She noticed the papers in her girlfriend's hand. "What's that?"</p>
<p>Lilly held up the papers and then tossed them onto Miley's chest. "Your homework."</p>
<p>Miley groaned and turned onto her side. "No-o! Lilly, how could you?"</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm not about to cross your mom. She's tough."</p>
<p>A contemplative look crossed Miley's face. "Worse since Richard."</p>
<p>Lilly watched her girlfriend, but Miley was clearly serious. "You don't really think that, do you? Your mom's always been very strict."</p>
<p>Miley turned her head enough to look up at Lilly. "Yeah, but I never listened and it wasn't a big deal. Now she gets really mad."</p>
<p>"But why's that Richard's fault? Maybe your mom was just fed up?"</p>
<p>"'Cause he's evil," said Miley simply and though she sounded completely serious, Lilly could tell she was adding a hint of exaggeration. Lilly rolled her eyes and nudged Miley in her side.</p>
<p>"Well, then you don't wanna piss him or your mom off. Come on, you can use my computer." Lilly pointed at the papers now partially crushed under Miley's body.</p>
<p>Miley frowned, clearly realizing she wouldn't get out of the homework. A grin suddenly appeared on her face. "What do I get in return?"</p>
<p>"Your mom not mad at you," said Lilly, pretending to not know exactly what Miley was angling for.</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"Isn't that enough?"</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "I think you should pay me in sexual favors."</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't believe this was the same girl whose first kiss and virginity she had stolen just a few months ago. She shook her head. "No way, not with the door open and all our parents downstairs and my brother right next door." Seeing Miley's sad pout she sighed. "Fine, you can get some cuddle time. And maybe a few kisses, but only if you do your homework properly."</p>
<p>Miley grinned and sat up, grabbing the papers. She knew cuddling and a few kisses always ended in a heavy makeout session, so ultimately she was going to get what she wanted. She sat at Lilly's desk, determined to finish as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"What'd you get me?"</p>
<p>"Come on, you can tell me."</p>
<p>"Lilly, what'd you get me?"</p>
<p>Lilly just smirked, her resolve unwavering. Miley had been bugging her about her present for close to thirty minutes now, to no avail. They were stretched out on the couch in the living room, Miley lying on her back in between Lilly's legs with her head resting on her girlfriend's chest. They were watching "A Christmas Story" on TV, while the adults remained in the dining room, talking and drinking coffee. Lilly's brother, Michael, was home for the holidays, but said he was too cool to watch the movie and had gone straight to his room after dinner.</p>
<p>Miley turned over, looking up at Lilly with a grin. "Tell me, Lilly."</p>
<p>"I didn't <b>get</b> you anything, Miles," said Lilly simply and it was the truth. Miley normally hand-crafted all her presents to people, out of feathers and beads and sticks and stones, creating some of the strangest items known to man. But Lilly had been the one to suggest they make each other's presents for birthdays and Christmas, worrying about Miley or Susan spending money they didn't have, but over time she had come to really like the idea. It certainly took a lot more thought to make something than to simply buy it.</p>
<p>"Then what did you make me?" asked Miley, trying for the umpteenth time to get Lilly to open up.</p>
<p>"Just be patient, Roadkill, you'll find out soon."</p>
<p>Miley heaved an impatient sigh, but, as usual, Lilly kept her grounded. Otherwise she would likely have gone up the wall from curiosity by now. She nudged Lilly in the side. "Lils, go tell them we're ready to open the presents now."</p>
<p>"No way, you go tell them. I'm too comfy to get up," said Lilly, wrapping her arms around her girlfriend. Miley was the perfect weight, comforting and warm and whenever they cuddled like this Lilly just felt completely at ease and relaxed. If she had her way, they wouldn't even bother with presents tonight â€“ Miley was all she needed.</p>
<p>As it turned out, neither of them had to get up, since the adults finally decided to venture into the living room. They'd decided to just open some presents tonight, when both families were present. The Truscotts would open the rest of theirs in the morning and Lilly felt guilty knowing Miley wouldn't get anything else. Of course, she had to remind herself, Miley didn't mind in the slightest and Lilly loved that about her. Not everyone could be absolutely happy with whatever they had.</p>
<p>"Girls, are you ready to open presents yet or do you need a few minutes?"</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes at her dad, knowing he liked to tease them every chance he got. All five adults entered and took the various open seats around the room. Lilly nudged Miley until the girl sat up â€“ as much as Lilly loved to cuddle she didn't want to do it around their parents. Even Michael joined them downstairs, though only after having to be bribed with the promise of getting to open some presents. He plopped down right next to Miley, thankfully having long gotten over his mistrust and fear of her.</p>
<p>"Alright, me first," he proclaimed, earning annoyed glares from both his parents, but no one stopped him from opening the first present.</p>
<p>Instead of watching her brother, Lilly's eyes were focused on her girlfriend. Miley looked just as excited at the prospect of someone else opening their present as she did about her own and Lilly shook her head, smiling. She should have known. Lilly was so wrapped up in her thoughts, she was surprised to find an oddly wrapped package thrust into her arms. She looked at Miley, who grinned excitedly.</p>
<p>Lilly squeezed the present to get a feel for it, knowing one could never be too careful when it came to Miley. It was soft and Lilly slowly undid the wrapping paper. Inside was a slightly misshapen knitted beanie in blue and gold colors. It certainly wasn't the best looking thing, but just knowing Miley had tried to not only make Lilly's favorite article of clothing, but also in the colors of her favorite school, was enough to make it the best hat she owned.</p>
<p>"You like it?" asked Miley, sounding not at all doubtful.</p>
<p>"I love it, Miles. Thank you," said Lilly honestly and leaned forward to peck her girlfriend's lips. She knew everyone was watching but a good present deserved a kiss.</p>
<p>Michael made a gagging noise. "Ugh, no PDA next to me."</p>
<p>"Shut it, jerk," said Lilly, earning a look from her mother. She tugged the beanie on her head, making Miley grin wider. "When did you learn to knit?"</p>
<p>"In the hospital, when I shared a room with that old woman, Ethel. She wanted me to make a sweater, but that took too long."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed. She could only imagine hyperactive and impatient Miley knitting a hat. She was surprised it hadn't come out looking a lot more misshapen than it did. Lilly turned to look at Susan, who was already holding a small, neatly wrapped package. The woman handed it to Miley, whose eyes were already gleaming.</p>
<p>"Miley, this is from grandma and Lilly and me." Susan got a confused look and motioned for Miley to go ahead. "You'll see."</p>
<p>Miley took no care with the wrapping paper, ripping it down the middle and opened the box to reveal a shiny new mp3 player. She looked at her mother, awed and speechless, and Lilly had to laugh at the look on her face. She knew Miley had wanted an mp3 player for a while, because she loved music and was always running around somewhere, but they were too pricey for Susan's budget. Lilly had known the moment Susan approached her with the idea, Miley would absolutely love it.</p>
<p>"I hope you like it, honey. Grandma had to play a lot of bingo for the money," said Susan, chuckling at the end. Miley grinned and practically jumped at her mother to hug her. She even made her way, crutchless, over to where Grandma Ruby sat to hug her, as well. Susan got her to sit back down. "The mp3 player is from Grandma and me, but what's on it is from Lilly."</p>
<p>Miley looked at the player in her hand. She hadn't noticed it wasn't sealed in its box until now. "What's on it?"</p>
<p>"Your daddy's old songs. I don't know how she did it, but Lilly transferred all his old tapes onto the computer. Now you can listen to him whenever you want, sweet pea."</p>
<p>"Daddy's tapes?" Miley looked down at the mp3 player in her hands like it was a most sacred object and Lilly didn't think she'd ever seen anyone look so happy, but so sad at the same time.</p>
<p>She'd originally just offered to put some of her music onto the player since the Stewarts had no computer, but when Susan had mentioned something about old tapes, Lilly saw her chance for a great, handcrafted Christmas present. Mr. Stewart had been an avid musician in his day and had recorded many covers, as well as some originals, onto cassette tapes that ended up gathering dust and rotting away in some boxes. He'd never made it big, but now, years later, at least Miley still had something to hold onto.</p>
<p>Miley turned to Lilly and wrapped her arms as tightly as possibly around her girlfriend. Lilly squeezed back, now more glad than ever she had suggested the hand-made present idea. She didn't think anything she could have bought would've made Miley half as happy as having her dad's songs.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lils. This is the best present ever."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you like it, Miles. I love you." Lilly said the last part as quietly as possible, but when Miley pulled back just enough to lay a big, wet kiss on her, Michael made more gagging noises.</p>
<p>"Again with the PDA. Let's open more presents."</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes at him, but she was too content to care much. A few more presents were opened, including Miley's coupons to her mother and grandmother to do everything they asked for a whole day. Lilly had snorted at that, knowing it was probably impossible, but Susan had tucked it away carefully, claiming she'd put it to good use. Lilly's parents had even gotten something for Miley, a thick book detailing World War II in pictures and at the end of the evening everyone seemed happy and relaxed. They all sat together in the living room, telling stories and drinking hot chocolate under the lights of the Christmas tree. Miley sat snuggled up against Lilly, her head on the blonde's shoulder, while she flipped through the pages of her new book. Lilly noticed Richard had seemed tense all night, as if something were bothering him, but since not even Miley was annoyed by his presence tonight and she was so relaxed and happy, she let it go. It was Christmas, after all.</p>
