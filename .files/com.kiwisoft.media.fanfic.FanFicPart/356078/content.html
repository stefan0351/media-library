<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 8 -->

<p>The next few days as they continued their journey toward London were uneventful.  Annika and B'Elanna had little chance to talk alone together as Annika's mother took it upon herself to stay close to her daughter just in case her obedience to her father's demands was less than complete.  B'Elanna could see that Annika was suffering from their distance and in truth she had barely slept since their conversation, worried that perhaps she was causing harm to the woman she loved by her admission of feelings.  She wondered if it wouldn't be better to simply take the family as far as London and then never see Lady Hansart again, but she knew she would never have the strength to do such a thing.  She couldn't bear the thought of Annika married to a man who didn't love her, and the thought of another man touching her caused her blood to boil.  There had to be a way for them to be together.  Surely she hadn't waited her entire life to find a love like this only to have it denied her.  She had put her life to the hazard when she decided to pose as a knight, and so the thought of being discovered courting Annika held little terror for her, but she was worried on Annika's behalf.  She would rather die than cause harm to the beautiful young woman.</p>
<p>When they finally reached London the Hansarts informed Harry and B'Elanna that they would be staying in the castle outside of the city.  The city of London at that time was a cesspool of refuse and raw sewage, overrun with rats and disease.  Thus the nobles tended to present themselves to the Royal court and stay within the castle battlements outside of the city where the chances of contagion were greatly reduced.  Harry and B'Elanna were going to stay in the King's forest outside of the city and B'Elanna managed to tell Annika where they would be before the family disappeared over the drawbridge and into the castle courtyard.</p>
<p>As they had traveled B'Elanna and Harry had continued to make their plans for the future.  They had made several inquiries into the best place to find a horse suitable for jousting, as well as the best place to have armour and lances fashioned for the endeavour.  They ventured into town on their first day and purchased a wagon to carry their new equipment as well as a tent in which they would live while they trained and traveled.  They were both happy to be living in the woods again, but neither of them would miss sleeping on the cold hard ground and being soaked by the nighttime rains.  They set up their tent and their bedrolls and went off in search of the horse breeder they had heard so much about from the merchants in town.</p>
<p>It was nice to be alone together once again, and able to travel at their own pace without plodding beside the much slower carriage.  They laughed and talked louder and longer then they had in days as they made their way to the breeder's land.  A low stone wall made taller by piles of cut hawthorn trees began to run alongside the path they took when they turned off the main road.  The path and fence ran for several miles and in the distance they saw several large outbuildings used to house the brood mares when they were foaling.  They rode into a large open yard where dozens of men were working busily with horses in various stages of training.  Some were simply being lunged in wide circles on ropes and others ridden through a series of obstacles.</p>
<p>In the middle distance no fewer than 8 men were breaking a horse for riding.  There were 3 ropes around the animal's neck and 2 men had hold of each rope.  The horse's eyes were wide with fright and the animal's hide was covered in a thick lather of white foam.  The animal thrashed and bucked as the man riding held on for dear life.  Several other men attempted to control the animal with long whips.  They moved as a mass of seething bodies wherever the horse pulled them in its attempt to free itself from its captors.  Finally the animal fell to the ground, rolling completely over the rider before staggering to its feet again, standing with heaving flanks a sheet of viscous fluid streaming from its drooping lips in its exhaustion.  B'Elanna closed her eyes and looked away, unable to watch the training continue.</p>
<p>"Looks worse than it is," came a voice from beside her.  "I'm Norton, the breeder here, can I be of some assistance."</p>
<p>B'Elanna climbed down from her horse and extended her hand to the tall thin man standing beside her.  His face was weather beaten and as worn as old leather from a life lived out of doors.</p>
<p>"I'm looking for a horse suitable for the joust," she replied.</p>
<p>"Well, this is the place where you'll find one then.  I supply King Henry himself with his horses.  Now do you want an older horse, trained or untrained, broken to saddle or not?" The man wasted no time with small talk and got straight to business.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was uncertain as to the answers to his questions so she merely asked to be shown around the facility.  Norton took her through the brood stalls, all the time listing the various attributes and lineage of each horse B'Elanna admired.  A horse already trained for tournament was terribly expensive but not out of their reach, however when they emerged from the barn to see the stable hands once again fighting with the bay stallion in the yards she made up her mind instantly.</p>
<p>"I want a green horse, I'll break him myself."</p>
<p>Harry's cough of disbelief told the breeder everything he needed to know about B'Elanna's experience in this area, but his attempts to dissuade her were to no avail.  She couldn't bear to see the rough treatment these men were doling out.</p>
<p>They walked to a paddock further out from the barns where several young colts were awaiting their training. B'Elanna's eye was immediately drawn to a huge black stallion whose mane and tail were slightly wavy as opposed to the more usual straight manes of most horses.  The animal was spirited and when the breeder yelled out to startle the horses the young animal ran like the wind, muscles rippling under coal black hide.</p>
<p>B'Elanna told the man this was the horse for her; both he and Harry attempted to talk her out of her decision as they felt the animal was too large and too strong for one her size.</p>
<p>"At least let him train the horse," Harry begged, but B'Elanna would not be swayed and she struck a bargain with the man on the spot.</p>
<p>Several of the stable hands rode into the paddock and cut the huge beast from the herd, roping it and leading him over to where B'Elanna and Harry were waiting.  They handed the ropes over and walked away shaking their heads.</p>
<p>"A fool and his money are soon parted," she heard one of them mutter.</p>
<p>They attached one rope to either side of the animal's halter; Harry was relieved to find at least the beast was trained to a halter and lead.  Each one of them took a rope and secured it to the pommel of their respective saddles and they began the journey home.</p>
<p>"You have no idea what you're going to do with this horse do you B'Elanna?" Harry inquired as they turned onto the road to London.</p>
<p>"Nope, but whatever it is it won't be as repugnant as what those men were doing back there."</p>
<p>"But that's how horses are broken, there is no other way I know of to get a horse to accept a rider."</p>
<p>"I refuse to believe you have to break an animal's spirit like that.  There has to be a better way and I'm going to figure out what that is."</p>
<p>"You mean you're determined to break your neck," Harry replied.</p>
<p>"We'll see," was all B'Elanna would say, although secretly she was wondering if she hadn't made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>When they arrived back at their encampment they hobbled the horse along with the other three and the two of them spent hours collecting fallen branches and brush with which to construct an enclosure to hold the animals.  It was after dark when they felt they had a sufficient pen, but they left the animals hobbled just to be certain.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was up well before dawn and she went out to the pen to observe the animals.  An idea was taking shape in her mind and she was anxious to set her plan in motion.  She went for a run through the forest and returned to find Harry already cooking a rabbit they had caught in the snares they set around their campsite.  She informed him of her plans and the two of them saddled their horses and rode toward the marketplace of London as soon as breakfast was finished.</p>
<p>When they reached the city they stabled the horses and entered the marketplace.  B'Elanna sought out the armourer's guild and began to make arrangements for a suit of armour for jousting as well as the purchase of several practice lances and a quintain.  When she returned to the open-air market she was delighted to see Annika and Kate admiring several bolts of cloth at one of the tables.  She was even happier to note that Annika's parents were nowhere in evidence.  She walked to where they were standing and pretended to be engrossed in the wares on the table until Annika's gasp told her she had been seen.  She turned with a wide smile, gratified to see that it was mirrored on Lady Hansart's beautiful face.  Taking her delicate hand she kissed it, lingering over the kiss, reveling in the contact.  When at last she straightened up, still holding Annika's hand, she smiled again to see the blush that had spread over Annika's features.  She offered her arm to the Lady and the couple spent several hours wandering through the marketplace together while B'Elanna regaled the younger woman with her plans.  Since the tournament season around London did not begin for another month Annika was pleased that the search for a suitable husband had effectively been put on hold for a similar period of time.  She was happy to see Lord Beyla again and to be in his presence.  She had missed the feel of his strong arm when she walked, and missed the feeling of someone listening to her every word when she spoke.</p>
<p>Tom and Harry soon found them and the group once again took their noon meal together.  B'Elanna explained to Tom where their encampment was and Annika casually mentioned that she thought she might begin riding in the afternoons to pass the time.  Tom's grin told her that he wasn't fooled at all, but he agreed to ride with her and B'Elanna knew that she would be seeing the three of them often in the woods.  Once again everything seemed to be going smoothly, and B'Elanna took it as a sign that this was meant to be.</p>
<p>After saying a heartfelt goodbye to Annika, B'Elanna finished purchasing her supplies and she and Harry returned to their encampment.</p>
<p>B'Elanna wasted no time in beginning her plan. Taking some of the grain and sugar she had purchased at the market and placing in it her pockets she slipped into the horse pen.  The black colt rolled his eyes and shied away at her approach, but eventually the smell of the sugar in her pockets brought him close.  B'Elanna walked away at his approach and pretended not to notice he was following her.  She took a deep breath and turned her back, leaning on the poles they lashed together as a gate and pretending to stare off into the distance oblivious to the animal.  She heard his feet dancing on the ground behind her as he approached and shied away.  He was leery of her, but the scent of the sugar and grain was pulling him close...eventually her patience was rewarded as she felt his muzzle nudging at her pocket.  Still she did nothing...allowing him to smell her and root in her pockets at will.  She slowly moved her hand into her pocket...as soon as she moved the colt danced away, but returned quickly this time...scenting the air and coming closer.  She stood motionless, the grain in the palm of her hand, eventually she felt his nose shove into her palm, withdraw and return again, this time to eat the treat she held.  She turned her head and he leapt away from her ... dancing away to the other side of the pen.  This time she turned around to face him, keeping her eyes on the ground as he returned again to eat from her palm.  She put out a hand as he ate, and although he shied away at first eventually she was able to run her hands over his head and neck as he ate.</p>
<p>She began to follow him in his perambulations around the pen, all the time allowing him to eat from her hand and she began to talk to him in low even tones, a constant stream of encouraging words and touches until he was calm in her presence.  After several hours of this she left the pen and had her dinner.  Once she had eaten she climbed back into the pen, gratified to see that he took only minutes to allow her to get close to him this time.  Her days became a rhythm of exercise; jousting practice on her current mount and hours spent talking with her new friend.  The animal got so he would respond to the sound of her voice and come to the gate of the pen to see her when he heard her approach.  Slowly she introduced new concepts to the animal.  Laying a blanket over his back, all the while keeping up her steady calming talk, she tied a leather strap loosely around his belly, gradually tightening it to simulate the feel of the girth of the saddle.  He slowly learned to tolerate all of these new stimuli.  She was constantly touching him, running her hands over his flanks, legs, and eyes, picking up his hooves until he was no longer nervous at her touch.  She leaned on his back gently to get him used to the idea of weight, and then after a time she placed a saddle there, allowing him to throw it off several times, but always replacing it until he tolerated its presence as well.  Slowly she introduced him to the bit, coating it with sugar at first as she introduced it to his mouth.  Finally the day came when he would tolerate all of the tack being placed and tightened on his body.  She led him around the paddock for an hour by the reins until she was satisfied he was used to the sensation of pressure on his mouth.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is the day," she told Harry.</p>
<p>As skeptical as he had been in the beginning Harry had to admit that the animal seemed to have bonded with B'Elanna.  He had never imagined that she would get this far with the beast, but he was terrified that his friend would be killed the next day when she attempted to mount him.</p>
<p>Beyla's handling of the huge destrier mesmerized Annika.  She watched as he talked to the horse and was amazed at his gentleness and how the beast responded to it.  Every time she saw the Lord and his animal she fell more deeply in love with him.</p>
<p>Her jousting practice, however, was a source of great amusement for Harry and the others, for indeed Tom, Kate and Annika were frequent visitors to the camp. She could hold the lance all right, she was strong enough for that, but it was two straight days of practice before she hit the quintain's target shield for the first time.  The quintain was a tricky piece of equipment, if you struck it soundly in the centre it would simply swing harmlessly aside, but if you struck it off centre the heavy counterbalance would swing around and take you off your horse as it struck you in the back of the head.  After two days of trying she finally hit the target, only to drop her lance as the vibration from the hit shook her to the core and then to add insult to injury the counterbalance unhorsed her neatly several seconds later.  She spent most of the next few days picking herself up off the ground, and by the time she could strike the target with any regularity she was more battered and bruised than she had been after any sword fight.  But no matter how battered and tired she became she always found time to bond with her horse and time to spend walking and talking with the beautiful Lady who had so completely stolen her heart. She loved walking through the sun-dappled forest in the afternoon holding Annika's hand in her own.  They would walk to a clearing in the woods and sit upon the boulder there to talk, Annika would rest her head on Beyla's shoulders as they chatted, feeling safe in his arms, and the two gradually grew even closer than they could have imagined.</p>
<p>The entire group knew that the next day B'Elanna was going to attempt to ride her new horse, and they were all anxious to be present.  Tom had agreed to assist Harry in handling the ropes that would hopefully control the beast.  B'Elanna hadn't shared her entire plan with her friends, but she was confident that she would be successful.  There was no way she would allow herself to fail in front of Lady Hansart.</p>
<p>The next day she was up before dawn as usual and she did her exercises and ran for an hour before returning to the camp to prepare the horse for the day.  She saddled him and fed him, all the while talking to him in the same low tones.  She led him out of the pen and walked through the woods with him, throwing her arm over his neck as far as she could while they walked.  Finally she came back and left him saddled in the pen while she waited for the others to arrive.  About a half-hour later she heard them coming through the woods and she walked out to greet them.  Annika and Kate were riding sidesaddle as always and as always B'Elanna felt her breath catch and her heart beat faster at the sight of Lady Hansart.  She chatted with Annika as they walked back to camp. Not wishing to waste any daylight she had Tom and Harry ready the ropes immediately.  She entered the pen and tied the two long ropes one on either side of the halter, looping the excess rope over the saddle before she led the animal out of the pen and urged the group to follow her as she walked with the horse toward the river.</p>
<p>She had chosen a spot where the river was relatively deep, up to the chest of the horse.  She sent Tom with one end of the rope to the other side of the river and handed the other end to Harry.  She instructed them not to pull on the rope or attempt to interfere with the animal's movements in any way unless it was to stop the beast from escaping or harming itself.  It took almost a half-hour to coax the horse into the river, but finally it was standing calmly in the water with B'Elanna beside it.  She ran her hands over the animal and talked to it, feeding it several handfuls of grain before she returned to its side and put her foot into the stirrup.  In one fluid motion she swung herself into the saddle.  There was a moment of complete stillness while the fact that someone was on its back registered in the animal's brain, and then it exploded into action.  It tried to buck and twist as all horses do, but the water slowed its motion down, tiring the horse quickly.  B'Elanna took a few moments to feel safe on the animal's bucking back and then she started again with her stream of steady and comforting talk, sparing one hand to stroke the animal's neck and using the other to hold herself firmly in place.  In about ten minutes the beast calmed down enough to stand still with B'Elanna still astride.  She didn't moved for several minutes, but simply kept talking; then, telling Harry and Tom to follow, she lightly touched her heels to the animal's sides and urged it forward.  This brought on another minor fit of bucking and pitching, but it calmed down quickly and moved forward through the water.</p>
<p>Nobody could believe that she had done it.  Annika had never taken her eyes of Beyla the entire time.  This was a man like none she had ever dreamed of, his gentleness and strength making a stunning combination.  She knew that no one would ever own her heart and soul the way Beyla did.  Truly he was magnificent astride the huge animal as they moved as one through the water.</p>
<p>Finally when they had gone as far as they could she called to Tom to ride back over the river and she urged the horse out of the water and onto dry land.  The horse shook itself furiously when it cleared the river, but otherwise remained calm as Harry and Tom led it alongside the river and back in the direction of their camp.  B'Elanna draped herself over the horse's neck, talking and cooing to the beast as they went, and when they rode into the pen she leapt down and made sure the animal had more than its fair share of sugar and grain as a reward.  There was still much to be done, but the worst was over with, the animal had accepted her as a rider.  Over the course of the next few days she taught the animal to obey her commands; several times she was thrown to the ground, but overall her plan had been a huge success, and the beast was as devoted to her as she was becoming to it.</p>
