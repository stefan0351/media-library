<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Inner Fear -->

<p>Nicole reached down and took Lily's warm hand in her own. She loved these quiet moments with Lily, with no school pressures, no home pressures, nothing to come between the two of them and they were free to be who they were. She was free to express her feelings for the other girl without fear of being found out or repercussions. She felt Lily squeeze her hand back.</p>
<p>"What's on the agenda for tonight, Nic?" Lily asked softly. </p>
<p>"Well, the old bag is in Phoenix so I thought if you wanted to we could watch some movies at my house," Nic suggested hopefully. She really just wanted to spend some quiet time with Lily away from prying eyes. Lily sighed happily. </p>
<p>"I think I'd like that," she said. "What about Jeeves or whatever his name is? You know, the butler." Lily still hated that man for the way he treated her when she first went to talk to Nicole. Nic laughed.</p>
<p>"I sent him to the guest house so we have the house to ourselves," she said. </p>
<p>"Oh, cool," Lily said as Nic walked her to the car. They'd just finished an early dinner at a nice restaurant and Lily was looking forward to a night in with Nicole. Surprisingly enough, at least to Lily, she really enjoyed Nicole's company and was finding that her feelings for the shorthaired blonde were growing. She no longer found her thoughts consumed by Sam. Sure, Sam still factored into a lot of Lily's thoughts but now Nicole had wormed her way into more and more of them. Lily smiled to herself. If you had told her six months ago that she'd be hanging out with, nevermind falling in love with, Nicole Julian, she would have slapped you, nonviolent nature or not. And yet, here she was. </p>
<p>They arrived at the Julian mansion and settled down in Nicole's room to watch a few DVDs. They started with Dracula 2000 during which Lily ended up sprawled across Nicole's lap with Nic stroking her hair. Not that she was frightened, Lily just craved the close contact and Nicole was more than happy to oblige. After Dracula they got up to choose another movie from Nic's collection. They decided on Sweet November and as they turned towards the bed, Lily pulled Nicole to her and kissed her passionately. </p>
<p>Nicole was surprised at first at Lily's forwardness but returned the kiss fervently and felt Lily's hands travel up her sides. She shivered with delight. They fell back onto the bed entangled together in their passionate embrace. Their kisses became more heated and hands more insistant as they both pushed things further than they'd gone before. Nicole felt as though her heart was going to pound it's way out of her chest and her head was spinning. Lily's skin was silky smooth and hot to the touch and Nicole wanted to experience it all. </p>
<p>"Nic, wait," Lily panted, pulling away suddenly. Nic looked at her in confusion. "We can't?I can't?I mean?I'm not ready for this," she said finally as a tear slipped down her cheek. "I'm sorry." Nicole reached out and wiped the tear away. </p>
<p>"Don't cry," Nicole said gently. "And don't be sorry. If you're not ready then you're not ready. I'm not going to force you into something you don't want to do, Lily. I love you and I want you but I'll wait for you. When you're ready, Lily." And she meant every word. The very hope that oneday she and Lily would take the next step was enough for her for now. Nicole could wait. Lily looked at her with hope in her eyes. </p>
<p>"You're not mad?" she asked. Nicole shook her head.</p>
<p>"Of course not," Nic said. "Lily, it's your choice. I can't be mad if it's not right for you, that's not fair to you." Lily smiled at her the relief evident on her face. </p>
<p>"What did I do to deserve you?" Lily asked quietly. Nicole smiled brightly. </p>
<p>"You're you. And I should be asking what I did to deserve you. I'm the evil one, remember?" Nic joked half-heartedly. Lily hugged her tightly. </p>
<p>"You're not evil, just misunderstood," Lily said lovingly. Nic's heart swelled. She cared so much for the girl and honestly wondered what she did right to have Lily in her life. </p>
<p>"Thank you," Nicole whispered as they cuddled together to watch the movie. </p>

<p>Brooke rolled over and watched the sleeping form beside her. Sam, her Sam was asleep and blissfully unaware of the turmoil currently going on within the slender blonde beside her. She was tied up in knots and didn't understand why. She loved Sam, she was sure of that now. When Sam wasn't with her she felt like she wasn't breathing, her heart wasn't beating and everything was at a standstill. But when Sam was there, she was full, complete, alive. She didn't know how she ever survived without the other girl before. She was sure she couldn't live without her now. </p>
<p>But she was uneasy, restless and couldn't put her finger on why. She sighed. She'd give anything to figure out what was going on with her lately. But ever since the whole mess with Nicole's mother a week ago, she felt like she was living on borrowed time. Brooke knew eventually their parents would have to find out about their relationship, especially since they were due home soon, but that wasn't what was bothering her. She hoped that her father and Jane took the news better than Nicole's mother did and figured that they would. No, that wasn't what was keeping her from sleeping. </p>
<p>Part of her knew it was fear of this secret getting out that was twisting her up inside. As much as she loved Sam, Brooke wasn't sure if she could deal with the entire school finding out that she was gay. Being labeled as gay, a dyke, a lesbian or any other word that went with it wasn't something Brooke was prepared to face even if it was the truth. If anyone outside of Sam, Nic and Lily found out, Brooke's entire image was going to change from `most popular' to `gay' overnight. No one was going to see her as anything else. And that scared her. </p>
<p>Sam rolled over and curled up closer to Brooke who reached out and wrapped her arms around the warm body in comfort. Sam murmured something softly but Brooke couldn't make out what it was. She smiled anyway. Sam had a natural way of making her feel better even when she wasn't aware of it. But Brooke was torn; she loved Sam, needed her but the repercussions of that were beginning to weigh heavily on her mind. </p>
<p>"I love you Sammy, I hope you know that," she whispered to the sleeping girl as she kissed Sam's forehead. (But now I have to figure out what I'm going to do next) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam watched Brooke from across the table two days later and wondered what was up with the blonde cheerleader. For the past few days Brooke was on edge, withdrawn and quiet and it was beginning to bother Sam. She couldn't think of anything that she could have done to upset Brooke so she decided to just ask. </p>
<p>"What's bothering you, hon?" Sam asked gently making Brooke jump and look at her guiltily. Brooke looked away from her inquisitive lover. </p>
<p>"Nothing," she lied. Sam arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Then what's with the silent act? Did I do something to upset you?" she asked worriedly. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"It's not you, Sam. Honest," she admitted. Sam leaned over the table slightly. </p>
<p>"Then what, Brooke? What's bothering you lately? I know something is, it's written on your beautiful face." Brooke sighed. She didn't know how to explain this to Sam without hurting her. </p>
<p>"This Sam," she said quietly. "Us. I don't know if I'm ready to handle all of it." All the color drained from Sam's face as Brooke's words registered in her brain. </p>
<p>"I begged you not to do this to me," Sam said, her voice breaking as she was unable to control her emotions. Brooke's head snapped up as she realized Sam had jumped three steps ahead of her. She opened her mouth to protest but Sam kept going. </p>
<p>"I asked you," Sam gasped as her breath became short, "not to start this if you couldn't handle it. It wasn't fair," she sobbed, "it wasn't fair to start this and then stop it because you couldn't handle the fall out." Her voice had started to rise and Brooke's mouth was opening and closing in a futile attempt to stop her. </p>
<p>"Wait, Sam, let me explain," she tried. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, I told you this would happen!" Sam ranted. "You'd change your mind and I'd end up heartbroken and you promised me it wouldn't. You promised me!" </p>
<p>"Sam!" </p>
<p>"I love you!" Sam exclaimed in a broken voice as she stood up and started to run from the room. Brooke got up and grabbed her in a bear hug and refused to let go. </p>
<p>"Why are you doing this to me?" Sam sobbed. </p>
<p>"Sam, calm down and listen to me!" Brooke said into Sam's ear. Sam struggled in her grasp for a minute before calming down. </p>
<p>"Sam, I'm not changing my mind. I love you too," Brooke said calmly. "I'm just confused as to what to do next. This is going to change everything. How everyone sees us." Sam sniffled. </p>
<p>"So?" she asked contemptuously. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"So, I don't know if I'm ready to handle that yet. I don't want to lose you but I don't want to face the consequences of us either." Sam glared at her hotly. </p>
<p>"Are you ashamed of me?" she asked angrily. Brooke looked at her wide-eyed. </p>
<p>"No! Where would you get an idea like that?" </p>
<p>"What's more important to you, your image or me?" Sam answered the question with a question. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"That's not fair, Sam. You know that my image has defined me for so long that I don't know what it's like to be known as something else. If I'm not Brooke `Homecoming Queen' McQueen, who am I?" Sam contemplated this for a few minutes but didn't answer. </p>
<p>"And if word about us gets out, I'll go from being her to being known as, labeled as gay. That's a pretty heavy label, Sam," Brooke said softly. "It carries ramifications of it's own." Again Sam was quiet for a while. </p>
<p>"You ever wonder why the slang term for homosexual is a synonym for happy?" Sam asked finally, throwing Brooke's train of thought so far off the track it was in another time zone altogether. </p>
<p>"Huh?" she managed before Sam's words sunk in and she burst out laughing. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"Well, it does make you think," Sam added. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I suppose it does," she agreed. She turned serious again. "But Sam, that does nothing to chase away my fears." Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"Mine either. The ones where you leave me," she explained in a whisper. Brooke held her closer. </p>
<p>"Never," she promised. Sam looked at her hopefully.</p>
<p>"I hope you mean that," she said. Brooke grinned. </p>
<p>"I do, despite my fears." </p>
<p>"You can't let your fears run your life, Brooke. If you do, then you'll never know what might have been, what could be. You'll spend your entire life in the box. Just think, if you hadn't overcome your initial fear, we wouldn't be where we are now," Sam pointed out while tracing Brooke's lips with her fingers. </p>
<p>"I know Sammy, but I'm so scared," she said as she leaned her head against Sam's. Sam kissed her gently. </p>
<p>"But you're not alone, love. I'm with you," Sam assured her. "And labels are nothing but words, letters strung together. They can't hurt you unless you let them." </p>
<p>"I'll try not to let them," Brooke said as she kissed Sam's forehead. "If you're there, maybe they won't." </p>

<p>Lily lay on her bed staring at her ceiling resisting the urge to stick her head in a blender. (Why did I push Nic away?) she wondered even as she knew the answer. (Because that last step means opening the last part of my heart and I don't know if I can do that) she admitted to herself. </p>
<p>She was scared. She knew she cared for Nic, actually, she was pretty sure it went passed caring now. She had wanted Nicole that night and it had taken all her strength to push the other girl away when all she really wanted was to grab ahold and never let go again. But there was this little piece of her that was afraid of having that deep a connection with another person. It was opening herself in a way she never had before and could lead to a whole new kind of emotional pain if it went bad somewhere down the line. </p>
<p>(But) Lily reminded herself (I am not one to back down from something because I'm afraid. If I want something, I go after it and I want Nicole) she blushed at her own thoughts and then giggled. Deciding on her course of action at that moment, she rolled over and picked up the phone. </p>
<p>"Hello?" Nicole's voice carried over the line. </p>
<p>"Hey, Nic, whatcha doin'?" Lily asked, suddenly feeling supercharged. </p>
<p>"Hey Lily," Lily could hear the smile on Nicole's face through her voice. "Nothing much. You?" </p>
<p>"Me either. Wanna come over?" There was a slight pause that made Lily worry that Nic was going to say no. </p>
<p>"What about your family?" Nicole asked suddenly. Lily nodded although Nicole couldn't see her. Explaining why her enemy Nicole Julian was suddenly appearing at the door would be hard to explain. </p>
<p>"Out of town visiting relatives. I'm home alone," Lily informed her. "I could use some company." She heard Nicole laugh slightly. </p>
<p>"Sure, I'm on my way," Nicole said happily. Lily grinned devilishly. </p>
<p>"Just let yourself in," she said cryptically. </p>
<p>"OK, see you in a few. Love you," Nic said quietly into the phone. The smile on Lily's face grew. </p>
<p>"Love you too," she said before hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>Nicole opened the door to Lily's house slowly, still hearing Lily's parting words echoing through her head. (She said she loves me) she thought happily. The still bitchy part of her mind was yelling at her to knock it off, that she sounded like Rudolph from the claymation Christmas special after the girl deer, Clarice, says he's cute. (You know, where he runs around yelling `She thinks I'm cute!' and ends up flying? Yeah, that's Nic right now) She chose to ignore the bitchy voice. </p>
<p>The house was dark except for some dim light coming from an adjoining room. Nic followed the light and was astounded to find dozens of candles lighting Lily's room bathing it in a soft glow. </p>
<p>"Lily?" Nicole called softly. </p>
<p>"Behind you," Lily whispered. Nicole spun around to face Lily. She sucked in an unsteady breath as she saw her. Lily was dressed in a royal blue teddy with a matching robe and a smile. Nicole's heart thundered in her chest and she found it difficult to breathe as she looked at the angelic vision in front of her. </p>
<p>"Lily?" she asked again as she swallowed hard. Lily reached out her hand. </p>
<p>"I'm ready when you are," Lily said gently as Nicole slipped her hand into hers and let herself be led to the bed. </p>
<p>"Are you sure?" Nicole asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Lily chuckled. </p>
<p>"Absolutely," she said as she slipped off Nicole's jacket. "Are you?" Nicole nodded mutely. "No more fears then, Nicole. I know what and who I want. You." Nicole let out the breath she didn't know she was holding and pulled Lily to her for a crushing kiss. </p>
<p>"God, Lily, I love you," Nicole whispered reverently. Lily ran her hands through Nicole's short hair. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Nicole. I see that now," Lily answered. Tears rolled down Nicole's face and Lily lovingly brushed them away. "Let me prove that to you. Let me give you all I have, me." </p>
<p>"All I have too, Lily," Nicole promised as they layed down on the bed together. "It's yours." Lily smiled. </p>
<p>"All I want is you, Nicole," she whispered. "All of you." </p>
<p>"Is yours," Nicole answered as they kissed passionately. And finally, Nicole felt free. </p>
