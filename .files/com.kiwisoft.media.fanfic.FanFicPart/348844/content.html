<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 4 - Sunset-->

<P>About half an hour after B'Elanna and Seven had decided to work on finding a
way to communicate with Voyager and determine the source of the bio-electric
field, Seven announced that she needed B'Elanna's tricorder to finish her job.
B'Elanna decided that it was no use scanning for the source of the field, and
gladly handed her tricorder over to Seven. </P>
<P>Seven took it and began to recalibrate it like she did the others. B'Elanna
took in a deep breath and suddenly noticed the beautiful sunset that had formed
in the direction of the apple patch. She closed her eyes and opened them again
to make sure that it was in fact real. It had a mixture of red, orange and
yellow, with some purple at the top to make it just perfect. B'Elanna drifted
into thought about the sunsets she use to watch when she was on Earth and felt
like she was finally home again. </P>
<P>B'Elanna lied down on her side with her elbow on the ground and her hand
supporting her cheek, taking in the beauty of the planet. "Beautiful." She
whispered to herself. But Seven's enhanced Borg hearing caught it like it was a
normal statement. "Beautiful?" Seven questioned. </P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna was shocked and surprised that Seven had overheard her.
B'Elanna turned her head to see Seven staring at her, no longer working on the
tricorder. "I believe you made a comment saying that something was beautiful. I
was only inquiring as to what was beautiful." Seven held her stare.</P>
<P>"Well, I was just saying that the sunset was beautiful, that's all." B'Elanna
tried to put it off, hoping Seven would stop her stare and return to work. But
of course the stare never wavered. "So this is what you describe as beautiful. I
do not understand why this particular mixture of colors qualify as beautiful,
while others do not." Seven was curious again. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was caught off guard, she expected the blonde Borg to simply state
that it was a waste of time. Then it hit her, this conversation started in the
mess hall, the first time the two had actually talked. "Well, I guess it's just
like you said Seven, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and is probably
learned from social upbringing. Nevertheless, I still say this sunset is
beautiful, and so would the majority of the crew." B'Elanna broke the stare with
those beautiful blue eyes and turned back to watch the sunset. </P>
<P>Seven waited a moment before she spoke, as if contemplating the meaning of
those words. "And this beauty, does it make you happy?" B'Elanna was surprised
at the questioning, but decided that Seven was just being curious about human
nature. B'Elanna turned around fully this time to face the Borg. "In a way yes,
and in a way no." She knew this would confuse the Borg. "Explain?" Was all Seven
could muster. </P>
<P>"Well, it does make me happy because it's so beautiful and it reminds me of
home. It also makes me sad for the very same reason." B'Elanna saw a hint of
understanding in Seven's eyes. "I believe I now understand Lt. Torres, thank you
for this enlighteningâ€¦ chat." And with that their conversation ended and they
both went back to what they were doing. B'Elanna enjoyed the sunset, while Seven
worked on the tricorder. </P>
