<!-- Gremlins \ Part Two -->

<p>Gabrielle opened her eyes slowly at first. The
very early rays of morning sunlight were just beginning to creep into the dark sanctuary
of their campsite. She wasn't sure why she was awake this early. It certainly wasn't the
norm for her. Most mornings Xena had to threaten her with a cold splash of water to get
her up from their bedroll. It was especially difficult when they had shared such a
wonderful night, like the one of last.</p>

<p>There. That was the reason. There was something
crawling around in the bedroll. Gabrielle could feel it running on top of the blankets.
Sleeping outside as much as she and Xena did they had become accustomed to sharing their
bedroll with the occasional small critter trying to stay warm so she really wasn't
alarmed. More than anything she was amazed that it hadn't woken Xena first, generally she
woke at the very first sign of something amiss.</p>

<p>Gabrielle still wrapped in the protective arms of
her warrior had no great desire to know what little pest had decided to join them. She had
determined from its first movement that it was not a snake and that's all that really
mattered to her. She closed her eyes and tried to return to the realm of Morpheus. For a
very short time she was successful, then her eyes opened again. This time she saw it.</p>

<p>It was crouched down on Xena's other shoulder
leaning on it's haunches, staring at Gabrielle. It's tiny hands resting on its thighs and
it's little ears laid back. The scream woke the warrior...</p>

<p>For Xena it felt as if someone had grabbed the
bard and jerked her free from her embrace. Then there was that blood-curdling scream as
the cool air assaulted hot flesh where the bard had been sleeping so peacefully all night.
Gabrielle's screams continued to cut through the air as Xena bolted to her feet, sword in
hand looking for the bastard that dare bring this kind of fear into the life of the woman
she loved. Her balance was slightly off due to the ringing in her ear from the first
scream that had been torn from Gabrielle. She stumbled slightly, but recovered very
quickly to see the only other person in the campsite was the bard. She turned a full
circle a few more times before beginning to relax.</p>

<p>As Gabrielle screamed and bolted away from the
warrior, the bard watched as the tiny figure was hurled forward into a patch of high grass
when the warrior sat upright in response to the screams. She would even swear later that
she heard a tiny thump and a groan as it hit the ground. She tried to keep her eyes glued
to the spot where she thought it had landed. She grabbed her staff and headed for the
patch of grass poking into the suspected area with the end of the trusty staff. She was
past screaming now. Now she was just frightened and cold. She continued to poke at the
grass even as she felt Xena's hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle what in Tartarus was that all
about?&quot; She asked as she placed a hand on the prodding staff and took it from the
bard. She pulled her into a gentle embrace and led her back to the blankets where she
draped them around the shivering bard. She reached above the bedroll and retrieved her
cloak and tossed it over her own shoulders to ward off the morning chill. &quot;Gabrielle
what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw it Xena.&quot; She stammered through
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>Xena turned and began to rebuild the fire so she
could get some hot tea into her chilled lover. &quot;Saw what?&quot; She asked as she
continued to tend to the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;A gremlin.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena stopped, thanking the Gods her back was to
the bard as the smile crossed her lips. She didn't even want to turn around right now.
&quot;Gabrielle you know there's no such thing. You saw a mouse or some other little
critter that just wanted to get warm.&quot; She answered as she bit back a giggle. </p>

<p>&quot;I know what I saw. It was just like you
said. It even had little floppy ears. Kinda like a rabbit.&quot;</p>

<p>The snort that erupted from the warrior gave her
away and the bard gave her a shove. &quot;Laugh at me will ya'. I'm telling you Xena it's
over there in the grass.&quot; Another snort and another shove. &quot;Damn it will you at
least quit laughing at me long enough to go over there and check.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena cleared her throat and stood and walked over
to the spot the bard had been poking with the staff. She knelt down and very thoroughly
ran her hands in and over the area. Satisfied that there was nothing there she turned back
to the bard and shrugged. &quot;Nothing.&quot; She said as she stood and returned to the
campfire. &quot;Gabrielle it must have been a dream.&quot; She said as she knelt before
the bard and took her hands into her own. She brought the bard's cold hands to her mouth
and blew warm air onto them. Without breaking eye contact she just gently rubbed the flesh
to warm it.</p>

<p>Gabrielle drew a deep breath, closed her eyes and
nodded in agreement. &quot;A dream. It must have been a dream.&quot; Feeling a little
embarrassed and ashamed she opened her eyes and still found the warrior watching her.
&quot;I'm sorry Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's my fault Gabrielle. I never should
have teased you last night.&quot; Xena softly kissed the bard's hands and returning to the
task of making tea. She poured water from a skin into a pot and set it to boil while she
got the leaves and the supplies for the morning meal from the saddlebags. &quot;Not much
left here. We're gonna have to pick up some supplies in the next village. We've got a
couple apples, some cheese, bread.&quot; She paused &quot;Would you like me to go catch
some fish for breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No it's too cold for you to be in knee deep
water trying to grab a slimy fish. This will be fine.&quot; Gabrielle said as she reached
for the food stuffs and began to prepare them. &quot;I think there's some stew left from
last night if you want something hot.&quot; She said as she added the leaves to the water.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw movement.
She turned her head slowly to see two little ears sticking out over a small log that lay
just a few feet away. She looked the other direction to see Xena getting dressed. She
wanted to say something, but there were no words. She wouldn't put herself through that
humiliation again. She took a small piece of bread and tossed to the other side of the
log. It landed far enough away that old long ears was going to have to go out and retrieve
it if he wanted it. She watched the bread intently, waiting. Glancing over at the two
little ears that twitched behind the wooden barrier.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on you want it.&quot; She whispered.
&quot;You know you want it. Gremlin's gotta eat too.&quot; She watched as the little
creature moved away from the log towards the bread. She mused about how cute he was
really. Long ears that swayed back and forth, little hands that seemed to only have three
fingers, solid feet that didn't appear to have any toes. Long ears picked up the bread and
appeared to be smelling it. Then he took a bite. Gabrielle smiled as she leaned forward to
get a closer look.</p>

<p>She watched him eat the bread. He watched her
too. Tiny little black eyes focused on her as she crept closer. She tore off a small piece
of cheese and held it out in front of her. Long ears sniffed the air. He crammed the last
of the bread into his mouth and took a tiny step forward.</p>

<p>Xena had finished dressing and looked over to see
her bard edging toward something that she couldn't see, with the blankets draped over her
like a tent. She took two long steps forward, &quot;What in the name of Zeus are you
doing?&quot; The warrior asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Feeding the gremlin.&quot; She replied
without even turning around to look at the warrior.</p>

<p>Xena just slapped her hand over her eyes, shook
her head and drug her hand down her face as she drew a deep breath and left her nails to
scratch her throat and neck. She splayed her fingers over her mouth as she spoke.
&quot;Gabrielle...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come here and look at him if you don't
believe me.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena took a step forward and peered over the
bard's shoulder. The empty ground before her told the warrior what she needed to know.
&quot;Okay Gabrielle I get it. Pay backs are a bitch.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle tossed the cheese to the long eared
little guy and turned to look at Xena. &quot;Pay backs? Xena what are you talking about
it's right there.&quot; She jerked her thumb over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle there's nothing there.&quot;</p>

<p>The bard turned around and he was shoving the
last of the cheese into his mouth. &quot;Xena it's right there! Can't you see it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No Gabrielle I can't see it, but hey I'm
the one who said they were invisible remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena he's right there eating a piece of
cheese.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gremlins like cheese do they?&quot; Xena
said as she smiled and turned back to the campfire.</p>

<p>&quot;Well apparently they do.&quot; The bard
replied indignantly as she got to her feet and walked over to the campfire. She watched as
her long eared little friend made his way towards the log and climbed over it. He slowly
moved toward Gabrielle, keeping his eyes on Xena. &quot;You scare him.&quot; Gabrielle
said quietly to her warrior as she slowly sat down. She didn't want to frighten it off.</p>

<p>&quot;Smart little gremlin isn't he.&quot; Xena
teased as she poured the tea. She handed the bard a cup. &quot;How do you know it's a
he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just a feeling.&quot; Long ears moved
closer to Gabrielle and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Does your little friend want some
tea?&quot; The warrior asked with a grin and a chuckle. &quot;No wait we left our teeny
tiny tea cup in our other saddlebags. Sorry.&quot; Xena's laughter came freely now.</p>

<p>Gabrielle noticed that long ears seemed to droop
a little when Xena began laughing. He kicked the ground at his feet and turned and walked
away. &quot;Aw great now you hurt his feelings. He's leaving.&quot;</p>

<p>With tears streaming down her cheeks from
laughing Xena sat down to put her boots on. She slipped them on, but stopped long enough
to wipe the tears from her cheeks. She looked at the bard who was not amused. </p>

<p>&quot;You know Xena I'm hurt that you don't
believe me. How much do we have to go through before you take me at my word?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right Gabrielle this has gone on long
enough. You and I both know there's no such thing as gremlins.&quot; And with that as her
final word on the subject, Xena stood up, brushed imaginary dirt from her leathers. With
her held high, she started to take a step only to pitch forward, landing flat on her face.
She looked down and found that the laces of her boots had been tightly knotted together.
She looked over at the bard, who sat with her chin resting on her fist, just watching.</p>

<p>&quot;You were saying...&quot; The bard said
triumphantly.</p>

<p>Xena rolled over, sat up and growled, &quot;I
don't know how you did that, but it wasn't funny.&quot; She said as she picked at the
knotted laces.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I give up!&quot; Gabrielle growled back
as she stood up and returned to the bedroll for her clothes. She dressed quickly and sat
down to put her own boots on. Long ears popped up in front of her and stood between her
feet. &quot;That wasn't nice.&quot; She whispered as she laced her boots. Long ears
lowered his eyes and shifted back and forth. &quot;You understand don't you?&quot; He
raised his head and gave her a little gremlin smile and nodded. &quot;Well then you're
going to have to behave. You can't afford to make her mad.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena looked over at Gabrielle and watched her
talk to her feet. 'We've been on the road too long. She needs a rest' Xena thought as she
finished lacing up her boots. &quot;Ah, Gabrielle...&quot; She said softly, trying not to
startle her obviously road weary, reality challenged lover. &quot;Whaddya say we get a
room in the next village and take a couple days off.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked over at Xena. She was still
upset with the warrior and it still showed. She tried not to sound as irritated as she
felt. &quot;I'd like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay then. When we get to Onlet, we'll get
a room and just relax for a couple of days. Maybe you can do a little shopping...I can get
Argo's shoes fixed up properly...&quot; Xena's words faded as she began packing up camp.</p>

<p>Gabrielle reached out her hand and long ears
jumped into her palm. She raised her hand to her face to get a better look at him. He
smiled at her. She could see what she thought might be an incredibly sharp little set of
teeth. &quot;You don't bite do you?&quot; He shook his head no and rubbed his little face
against her thumb. Then he noticed Xena had bent over to retrieve something leaving her
backside unguarded. He looked to Gabrielle and gnashed his teeth. Gabrielle glanced over
and then back to him. &quot;Nooo don't do that. That would be bad.&quot; She said with a
smile. Long ears nodded his understanding. &quot;So what are we gonna do with you? I
suppose I should get you back into the woods huh?&quot; Long ears wrapped himself around
Gabrielle's thumb and shook his head no.</p>

<p>Xena glanced over at Gabrielle. She raised her
eyebrows and whistled under her breath. &quot;She may need more than a couple of
days...&quot; She said quietly as she picked up her saddle and bridle. &quot;I'm going to
get Argo. Can you...and your little friend...finish up here?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle knew that Xena didn't believe her, so
she decided just to humor her. &quot;Sure we'll be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena, on the other hand felt a great deal of
guilt for pushing her lover around the bend and knew she would do anything she had to do
to bring Gabrielle back to reality. Even if it meant humoring her for the moment.</p>

<p>As she approached the golden war-horse she
dropped the tack and leaned forward and rested her head on the horse&#146;s neck. &quot;Oh
girl I've really done it now.&quot; She said as she patted her beloved mare. &quot;I've
gone too far with her and she's snapped.&quot; Argo knickered and nodded her head.
&quot;We've got to help her girl. I've got to get her back.&quot; Xena reached down and
tossed a blanket over Argo's back. &quot;We've got to humor her for now girl.&quot; She
tossed the saddle up next. &quot;If she says she sees gremlins, then she sees gremlins,
got it.&quot; Again Argo nodded.</p>

<p>Gabrielle finished packing up camp as long ears
sat on a rock and watched her. He sat with his legs out in front of him, hands folded in
his lap. He wiggled the tips of his feet and his ears twitched back and forth. He cocked
his head from side to side as he continued to watch her. She stacked all their gear and
waited for Xena to return with Argo. She looked over at her little friend. &quot;So what <b>am
I</B> gonna do with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Long ears slid off the rock and skittered across
the campsite and began climbing up Gabrielle's scroll bag. Once he reached the top, he
scrambled under the flap and disappeared. Gabrielle could see the leather of the bag move
as he squirmed around inside. Suddenly he appeared, his little head and hands resting on
the edge of the bag. </p>

<p>&quot;Going with me huh?&quot; She asked as she
picked up the bag and put it over her shoulder. She looked down and could see him nodding
his head. &quot;Well I certainly understand the need to get away from someplace
unpleasant. You have to behave though. No more tricks on Xena, okay?&quot; He nodded and
let out a tiny little sigh.</p>

<p>Gabrielle could hear Xena coming with Argo. She
walked towards them slowly. Xena picked up her pace, she reached out a hand as they came
closer together. Gabrielle took her hand. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; They said in unison, each
smiling at the other. &quot;It's okay.&quot; Again in unison.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's get packed up and head out.&quot;
Xena said as they moved towards the campsite. As Xena bent over to grab the saddlebags
something caught her eye. She would almost swear they were little footprints in the dirt.
'Great now I'm doing it', she thought as she hoisted the bags onto her shoulder. </p>

<p>She picked up their bedrolls in the other arm and
returned to Argo. As Xena prepared to secure their gear, Gabrielle paid careful attention
to the mare. The bard opened her scroll bag and retrieved an apple, which she noticed, had
a small bite taken from it. She looked down at the guilty party who just shrugged.
&quot;These are for Argo. Leave them alone too.&quot; She whispered. Argo snorted and
nudged the bag with her nose and blew her lips at the little intruder who had taken a bite
from one of her apples. &quot;By the Gods Argo,&quot; the bard said surprised. &quot;You
can see him too!&quot; Argo nodded and took the apple. </p>

<p>&quot;Did you say something Gabrielle?&quot; Xena
asked as she finished securing the gear and patted the horse.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah no...&quot; She lied. &quot;I didn't say
anything. Just gave Argo her morning apple.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're spoiling my horse.&quot; Xena said
with a chuckle as she vaulted up into the saddle. &quot;Would you like to ride today?
We'll make it into town early if you do.&quot; Xena offered her hand to the bard.</p>

<p>Taking Xena's hand she allowed herself to be
pulled up behind her lover. She wrapped her arms around the warrior and laid her head on
her shoulder. Xena gripped Gabrielle's arm and the four of them set off for the next town.
