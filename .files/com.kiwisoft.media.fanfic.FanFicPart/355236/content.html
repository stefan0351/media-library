<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ The Dinner Party Pt.1 -->

<p>Before it?s bitter downfall, the McQueen/McPherson house was once known as the Palace.  Now, the Julian/Esposito home was known as the Villa.  While Sam?s mother?s house was still the main gathering place when they wanted to hang out and touch base with each other, Nicole and Lily?s home was where they all went to escape, to relax, and just be.  And tonight was going to be no exception.</p>
<p>The entire manor was decked out in shimmering shades of silver and gold.  Streamers, balloons, flowers, and other decorations adorned every possible spot making the lights dance and glitter around the room.  There was an army of decorators and caterers darting between the kitchen and various other rooms trying to get their appointed jobs done.   And they did all of this under the ever-watchful eyes of Nicole Julian.</p>
<p>She was anxious and jittery, desperately praying for everything to go right that night.  She and Lily were finally finished moving into the Villa so now they were throwing an extravagant housewarming party and inviting all their friends.  Along with Sam, Brooke, Jane, and Terri, the list also included Mary Cherry, Josh, Sugar Daddy, Carmen, Harrison, and George.  On top of the housewarming party, the whole thing was also going to once and for all settle all the rumors about what was truly going on.</p>
<p>&lt;Hey, Mom, your debutante is finally having her ?coming out? party&gt; Nicole snickered humorlessly.  &lt;Although I seriously doubt this is what she had in mind&gt; She then frowned due to the nausea turning her stomach.  She had a lot on her mind, a lot more than just the party and setting their friends straight about the relationship between her and Lily.  She was honestly scared to death about the other thing on her mind.  She figured Sam would have a good chuckle if she knew how petrified she was.</p>
<p>"Not that I?m going to tell her," she muttered to herself.  She reached into her pocket and ran her fingers over the object carefully cradled in her pocket, drawing quiet strength and comfort from its presence.  She wasn?t sure if she was going to follow through on her plan, but it was there in case she did.  She was bound and determined to prove to those who still doubted it that, yes, Nicole Julian did have a heart and that she was capable of loving someone other than herself.</p>
<p>&lt;And having that someone love me back&gt; she smiled happily, thinking of Lily.  She never thought she?d be as lucky as she turned out to be and have the Latina care for her the way she did.  But she wasn?t going to look a gift horse in the mouth and vowed to hold on to Lily as long as the other girl would let her.</p>
<p>"Place looks fantastic, Nic," Brooke said as she and Sam entered through the front door, breaking Nicole?s train of thought.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Nicole answered turning to face the duo.  She was heartened to see Brooke looking marginally better than she had in recent weeks.  Her prolonged forced imprisonment at home by her father had had a dramatic effect on Brooke.  She?d become dangerously thin and somewhat withdrawn.  The rejection and blazing hatred she?d experienced from Mike had wounded her and left her raw.  Plus, being away from Sam, the person who held her heart and soul, had been a special form of torture that Nicole could relate to.  Her time at boarding school away from Lily had been nearly unbearable.</p>
<p>But now thankfully, since Brooke was out of the Palace and staying with Sam, she was looking and doing considerably better.  Sometimes it still surprised Nicole, that of all people, Sam McPherson was Brooke?s soul-mate.  But for all of Nicole?s ?hatred? of Sam, which was really just a rivalry with her, she had to admit Sam was good for Brooke.  She kept Brooke centered and anchored.  And Nicole knew as long as Brooke had Sam that Brooke would be all right.  Whatever else came their way, she was positive of that.</p>
<p>"Earth to Satan, come in Satan," Sam?s voice shook Nicole from her wandering thoughts.  Nicole mock glared at Sam.</p>
<p>"I?m right here.  I hear you, Spam," she responded haughtily.  Sam snickered as she wrapped her arms around Brooke?s waist from behind and nuzzled the blonde?s ear.</p>
<p>"So, how goes plans?" she asked as Brooke leaned into her arms almost purring.  Nicole rolled her eyes at their obvious sweetness and gestured around the room.</p>
<p>"So far so good," she said simply.  "We?re ahead of schedule actually.  Providing that the cooks don?t burn anything, we?ll be ready by 6."</p>
<p>"People should start arriving between 6:30 and 7, right?" Brooke asked, lacing her fingers with Sam?s.  Nicole nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, the invitations said that it was semi-formal dress and that dinner started at 7:15 SHARP.  Any stragglers ain?t getting in.  I made SURE Mary Cherry knew that arriving ?fashionably late? was unacceptable."</p>
<p>"Where?s Lily while Admiral Julian is directing the troops?" Sam asked with a toothy grin.  Brooke giggled and Nicole stuck out her tongue.</p>
<p>"She wanted the perfect dress for tonight so she went out shopping.  She wants to surprise me," Nicole shrugged. "Hell, she could wear a burlap sack and be beautiful but, whatever makes her happy, you know?"  Both of the other girls nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah.  Our outfits are in the car.  We figured we?d get ready in one of the spare rooms," Brooke explained.  Nicole sighed dramatically.</p>
<p>"Lily and I told you what rooms were YOURS.  As in: NOT spares but YOUR ROOMS.  What, was 7 rooms on the north wing not satisfactory?" she asked cheekily.  Brooke blushed.</p>
<p>"OK, we?ll get ready in OUR room later.  Happy?" Brooke corrected herself.  Nicole smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"Very."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The first people to arrive were Jane and Terri, promptly at 6:30.  Jane was in a white pants suit and Terri was wearing one in dark blue.  They were followed shortly afterward by Carmen dressed in a simple long gray skirt and white shirt; then Harrison in a plain black outfit (resembling a funeral mourner in Nicole?s opinion); and then Josh, George and Sugar Daddy all arrived in tuxedos.  The only difference in their outfits was the color of their ties, vests, and cummerbunds.  Josh was in red, Sugar Daddy in deep purple, and George?s was a cream color.  All that was missing, aside from Sam and Brooke who were upstairs and Lily who was waiting for the guests to arrive before entering to show off the outfit Nicole STILL hadn?t seen, was Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>Nicole, in her golden gown that shimmered when she moved, glared at the clock as it neared 7.</p>
<p>"If she?s late, I?ll tar and feather her eccentric ass," Nicole muttered as Sam and Brooke came down the stairs.  She heard Josh and George let out low whistles at the two girls while Sugar Daddy could only manage a stunned ?whoa? at seeing them.</p>
<p>Somehow, Brooke had managed to get Sam into a dress, despite the brunette?s hatred of them.  It was deep burgandy velvet highlighted by satin in a lighter shade of the same color.  It was low cut, accentuating Sam?s bust line.  She was blushing almost as red as her dress at the whistles the guys were giving her and stopped on the stairs, half turned to retreat back up them.</p>
<p>"Keep going, Sammy.  You look fantastic," Brooke nudged her back down the stairs from behind.  Brooke?s dress was cornflower blue, matching her eyes and had silver accents.  It was also low cut with a slit up the leg almost to a dangerously high level.  She?d had a job keeping Sam?s hands from wandering while they were trying to get ready, it was one of the reasons they were coming down the stairs as late as they were.</p>
<p>"Sammy, you look beautiful," Jane sighed happily. "And Brooke, you look like an angel." Both girls blushed darker shades of red under the praise.</p>
<p>"She?s right, Brooke," Josh said in awe.  "I haven?t seen much of you lately.  I almost forgot how breathtaking you are."  Just as Brooke opened her mouth to respond to her ex-boyfriend, the front door flew open and Mary Cherry burst in.</p>
<p>"Ah?m here, y?all!  Lit?s git this par-teeeee stahted!" She was actually dressed tastefully in a simple black dress with silver beads.  It surprised Nicole, and the others that Mary Cherry didn?t actually show up in a hot pink mini skirt and a glow in the dark, light up shirt.  Or something similar.</p>
<p>"OK, the gangs all here.  Except for Lily," Nicole pointed out.  She looked at Brooke and Sam.  "Is she ready yet?" she asked nervously.  Brooke and Sam exchanged sly smiles that did nothing to allay Nicole?s fears, and then nodded.</p>
<p>"I?ll go get her," Brooke said simply, disappearing up the stairs.  Nicole looked to Sam for some sort of clue but Sam only smiled cryptically and shrugged.  </p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you, Miss Lily Esposito," Brooke said as she reached the bottom of the grand staircase again.  Everyone looked up to the top of the red carpeted stairs.  A collective gasp traveled through the group as Lily appeared at the top, lit by the crystal chandeliers.  She was a vision in shimmering silver.  Her dress seemed to shine in the light and change color like a prism capturing the light.  Her hair was pinned in a braid high on her head with tendrils and wisps of loose hair framing her face.  Nicole was speechless. </p>
<p>"Breathe, Nicole," Sam whispered in the stunned girl?s ear.  Nicole?s mouth opened and closed like a fish gasping for oxygen as she just continued to stare at Lily.  Lily looked at her shyly as she reached the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>"Niki?  Do you like it?" she asked quietly, ignoring everyone else in the room save for the girl she loved.  She spun around in place giving Nicole a 360 degree view of the dress. "Brooke helped me with my hair," she added, blushing.</p>
<p>"You look?you look?God, Lily, you look beautiful," Nicole finally managed when she regained her voice.  Lily walked over and hugged her.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Niki.  You look beautiful too," she whispered.</p>
<p>"So, you two are an item?" Carmen asked what everyone who already didn?t know was thinking.  Nicole and Lily parted and looked at their assembled friends.</p>
<p>"I think it?s time for dinner," Nicole announced.  "Everything will be explained then."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Dinner was served by a small group of tuxedoed waiters.  Prime rib, lemon chicken, salads, French onion soup, fresh baked rolls, tofu and vegetarian dishes for Lily, and countless other foods graced the table.  Everyone helped themselves to as much as they could manage and the dinner conversation stayed light for the most part, no one wanting to ruin such an exquisite feast with a possibly tense discussion.  But eventually, over the desert of chocolate mousse, Harrison broke the calm.</p>
<p>"So, what exactly HAS been going on?" he asked.  "I mean, the four of you disappear, then get sent to the ends of the world to be kept apart but no one will SAY anything.  How about letting us, your FRIENDS, in on the whole deal."</p>
<p>Nicole, Lily, Brooke, and Sam exchanged looks with each other and with Jane and Terri.  A few barely perceptible nods were exchanged and Lily cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"I guess I?ll start the story, since, like Brooke said a little while ago, technically this whole thing is my fault," she gave a self-deprecating grin.</p>
<p>"I am gay," she announced proudly.  "And I went to Sam to confess a crush?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>&lt;&lt;&lt;"Sam, you remember the night that we were all locked in the Novac and forced, thanks to Nicole to reveal our deepest, darkest secrets?" Sam gave her a disgusted look.</i></p>
<p><i>"Yeah, very educational night. We learned that Brooke slept with Josh again, Nicole slept with Josh, Josh is a ho, Carmen kissed Josh, you kissed Carmen and Mary Cherry is actually an endangered waterfowl. So?" Lily smirked over how Sam had convienently glossed over her own secret but continued anyway.</i></p>
<p><i>"Well, endangered wildlife aside, Sam, a lot more went on in that room than I think you realize," now Sam looked confused.</i></p>
<p><i>"I'm in love with you, Sam. Deeply," she confessed just above a whisper. &gt;&gt;&gt;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"And unfortunately at the time, or fortunately as it turns out," Lily said with a snicker. "Sam did not react the way I wanted." Sam nodded and took over from there.</p>
<p>"So, Lily confessed her crush on me but I didn?t feel the same.  I had someone else on my mind," she explained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>&lt;&lt;&lt;"But my heart is spoken for. Wholly and completely whether I like it or not," Sam said with a sigh.</i></p>
<p><i>"George," Lily said flatly with a hint of contempt in her voice. Sam let out a laugh that was more like a bark.</i></p>
<p><i>"Yeah, right," she scoffed sarcastically. "That's why I spend my Friday's at home nursing hot chocolate and watching bad TV movies and he's out dating his way through the junior class. We broke up a while ago, Lily. I think you might have missed that while you were `away'."</i></p>
<p><i>"If not George, than who?" Sam gave her a pained look.</i></p>
<p><i>"Not to rub it in, but same as you, someone and something I can never have," Sam said as a few tears fell down her face. Suddenly it smacked Lily between the eyes like a sledgehammer.</i></p>
<p><i>"Brooke," she whispered in awe. "You're in love with Brooke."&gt;&gt;&gt;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"You have to hand it to Lily, she?s quick on the uptake," Sam joked weakly.  "No one else, not even Brooke or my own mother had figured it out yet.  And here?s Lily, getting it right on the first try."</p>
<p>"You?re gay too, Sam?" Carmen asked, somewhat shocked.  Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yup," Sam said simply.</p>
<p>"So am I," Brooke broke in.  "But I was seriously in denial.  Anyway, I overheard Lily and Sam talking and knew everything.  And after a slight phase of ?OMG, this is not happening to me? I realized that I love Sam too."</p>
<p>"Which left me swinging in the breeze," Lily piped up.  Nicole smiled.</p>
<p>"Not for long," the petite blonde broke in. At everyone?s confused look at her, Nicole sighed.</p>
<p>"I?d had a deep crush on Lily for a LONG time.  And I decided to tell her.  She gave me a chance and got to know me, the REAL me. Not the bitch I pretended to be," Nicole went on.</p>
<p>"So, wait, wait, wait?" Josh broke in.  "All four of you are gay?" Four heads nodded at him.</p>
<p>"Yes, we are.  And Sam loves Brooke, Brooke loves Sam, I love Lily and she loves me," Nicole clarified.  "Everyone got that?  Because I can draw you a picture or go through it again slower if you need me too."</p>
<p>"No, I think we?re straight, Nicole," George said.  Then realizing what he?d said, he ducked his head. "Uhm?no pun intended.  Sorry." There was a slight rumbling of snickers and giggles that rippled through the table.</p>
<p>"That?s OK, George, we understood," Brooke assured him. </p>
<p>"So, issues aside, what else has been happening?" Carmen asked.  "Give us the whole story so that we can understand."</p>
<p>So they began talking, explaining everything from their earliest dates to their parents bad reactions and their time on the road.  Mary Cherry added the information she knew from when she helped Nicole and Lily and Terri spoke up when appropriate.  It took nearly an hour and a half for the entire long story to be told but when they were finished, their audience sat stunned.</p>
<p>"Mike?s an ass," Josh growled, the first to speak.  Then he looked over at Jane.  "Uhm, sorry, Mrs. McPherson." Jane smiled at him.</p>
<p>"It?s OK, Josh, you?re right, he is," she responded.</p>
<p>"Soooooo," Sam said nervously. "This dinner party was to welcome Nicole and Lily into their home and let you all in on what?s been happening."</p>
<p>"This is outrageous," Harrison grumbled.  "All FOUR of you are gay?  Is it the water supply?"  Sugar Daddy glared at him.</p>
<p>"Shut up, little man, before I box your head in," the normally kind SD warned. "If they?re happy what does it matter if they?re gay or straight?  It?s honestly none of OUR business who they sleep with.  Yo, they?re just respecting us and our friendship by being honest with us.  And if you have an issue with it, leave." Harrison sunk down in his seat and stayed quiet.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sugar Daddy," Nicole smiled.  Sugar Daddy blushed.</p>
<p>"Well, I think it?s only fair to inform you all that there are actually FIVE people at this table who are gay," he added quickly before he lost his nerve.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" chorused from around the table along with shocked expressions.</p>
<p>"I knew you were going to spill tonight," Josh sighed.  Sugar Daddy shrugged at him.</p>
<p>"Well, YOU knew Josh and were fine with it.  I figured since the girls are so honest, I should be too, yo" he said.  He looked back at the crowd.  "Surprise?"</p>
<p>It took a few minutes for everyone to calm down from chattering excitedly to Sugar Daddy trying to get information.  He confessed that he knew for a while and that he had met a really nice guy named Nate at football camp over the summer.  Eventually, they returned to the saga of the girls.</p>
<p>"Wow?maybe it is the water," George muttered with a small smile.  His face then grew serious. "Sam?" George looked at his former girlfriend.  Sam met his eyes and waited for him to explode in anger.  To her surprise, he simply smiled at her.</p>
<p>"I just want you to be happy, Sam," he said quietly. "And if that means being with Brooke?I mean, it?s a lot to take in because I do care for you but, be who you are, Sam.  THAT?S what?s important.  And it?s all I?ve ever asked of you."  Silent tears streamed down Sam?s face as she stood up.</p>
<p>"Thank you, George," she cried giving him a tight hug which he returned.  Josh stood up, drawing attention to himself.  He looked at everyone and walked over to Brooke.</p>
<p>"I?" he started and stopped, gathering his thoughts. "I cared for you a lot, Brooke.  I still do.  You will always be special to me and I know that this took a lot for you to tell us, to tell me.  And you?ve already been through hell from what you?ve told us.  I won?t add to that, especially since I?m fine with this.  Like George said, I just want you to be happy." He kissed her lightly on the cheek before returning to his seat.  </p>
<p>"Oh, and Sam?" he called to the brunette retaking her seat next to Brooke. </p>
<p>"Yeah Josh?"</p>
<p>"Take care of her.  Or I will find you," he warned with a wink.  Sam and Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"Carmen?" Lily asked.  Carmen had a somewhat glazed look on her face.  "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>"Oh my God!  All my best friends are lesbians and I?m the straight one!" Carmen started to giggle.  "I need a man, fast.  I?m jealous of you four."</p>
<p>"OK, NOT the reaction I was thinking we?d get from you, Ferrera," Nicole pointed out.  Carmen shrugged.</p>
<p>"You four just seem so damn happy.  How COULD I be mad or whatever?  Besides, we all know I?ve kissed Lily.  I AM straight but far be it from me to throw stones when I have wandered onto the Sapphic side of the street myself."</p>
<p>"This is unbelievable," Harrison mumbled.</p>
<p>"You came in through the front door, Harrison.  Feel free to leave back through it and don?t let it hit you in the ass on the way out," Nicole snapped.  Harrison sat up straighter.</p>
<p>"No, it?s not that?I just?I?I need time but you?re my friends.  I don?t want to go but it?s a huge shock.  I just need time to deal.  I?m OK, honest," he tried to explain.</p>
<p>"Than you can stay, Harrison.  Just be happy for us.  Can you try to do that?" Lily asked.  He looked at her and a small smile appeared to pull at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>"I can try."</p>
