<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 6: Finding Faith - Part 1-->

<p>In the dark of night, a black stretch-limousine pulled into the parking lot of a Happy Burger restaurant and went to the drive-through lane. The car stopped at a statue of a fat boy holding a burger. The back window lowered.</P>
<p>"Welcome to Happy Burger. May I take your order, please?" Said a voice through the speaker.</P>
<P>"Diet soda. Medium." Responded a well-dressed black man.</P>
<P>"That'll be eighty-nine cents at the window, sir."</P>
<P>He raised the car window, and the car moved forward. Inside, he started speaking to someone hidden in the shadows next to him.</P>
<p>"Sunnydale. Town's got quaint. And the people? He called me 'sir'. Don't you just miss that? I mean, admittedly, it's not a haven for the brothers, you know, strictly the Caucasian Persuasion here in the Dale. </P>
<P>"But, you know, you just gotta stand up and salute their death rate. I ran a statistical analysis, and hello darkness. It makes D.C. look... like Mayberry, and ain't nobody saying boo about it. We could fit right in here. Have us some fun."</P>
<p>The person he was talking to growled and stuck a cloven hand on his knee.</P>
<P>"We're here for one thing." Said the man in the shadows.</P>
<P>"Kill the Slayer, yeah. Still, big picture..."</P>
<p>"I’m afraid our boy Kakistos here is right. It’s the boss’ orders." Said a female voice.</P>
<P>The window lowered again, and the man looked out. He gave the kid at the drive-through window a dollar, and the kid handed him a drink, a straw, and change.</P>
<P>"Have a nice night, sir."</P>
<P>"Right back at ya."</P>
<P>"The Slayer. I'm going to rip her spine from her body, and I'm going to eat her heart and suck the marrow from her bones." Kakistos said.</P>
<p>From inside, the female voice spoke again.</P>
<p>"Why don’t you follow our cloven friend’s example? Big picture’s a waste of time. Kill something, and you won’t give a damn about what picture you’re looking at." </P>
<P>"Now I'm hungry." The man said.</P>
<P>He lunged out of the window, vamped out. He grabbed the boy by his shirt, and pulled him inside. As the car pulled away, screaming was coming from inside, and the boy’s legs hung out the window. </P>
<p>"Attaboy, Trick. It’s about time you remembered you were a vampire." The female said.</P>
<p>Trick, still vamped out, growled at her.</P>
<p>"Save that energy."</P>
<p>The girl looked out her window, and saw a redhead enter a synagogue.</P>
<p>"Tell him to stop the car."</P>
<p>"What is it?" Kakistos snarled.</P>
<p>"Just stop the car."</P>
<p>Trick pushed the intercom button.</P>
<p>"Pull over." He said.</P>
<p>The female opened her door, and stepped out.</P>
<p>"I’m gonna go gather some info. Might be useful."</P>
<p>"Such a go-getter." Trick said.</P>
<p>"I love my work. Don’t forget the plan."</P>
<p>Trick grinned at her and the limousine pulled away. She turned around and faced the entrance to the synagogue. Grinning, the brown-haired girl walked in.</P>

<p>Buffy sat at a table at the Bronze. Xander and Cordelia were dancing, and Oz was playing on stage. She sighed. Willow had been getting worse. Her parents hadn’t called, and Willow was getting more and more depressed. It wasn’t like her at all.</P>
<p>Buffy tried to do whatever she could, but it just wasn’t good enough. She tried to talk to her, tried to get her to go to the Bronze, and she even tried to get her to go bowling.</P>
<p><I>‘And she loves bowling.’</P>
</I><p>She did anything to make her feel better. Ice cream, movies, anything to get her mind off it. It frustrated Buffy that she couldn’t do more. She knew Willow was hurting, but she couldn’t make it go away. She had even tried to call Willow’s mom, but not surprisingly, all she got was a busy signal. </P>
<P>The band finished its last set, and Oz came over to the table.</P>
<p>"Will’s a no show again, huh?"</P>
<p>"She said she’d come by later. She had something she wanted to do first. Am I doing everything I can?"</P>
<p>"I’m sure you are."</P>
<p>"I’ve never seen her like this. God, I wish my being the Slayer allowed me to grant wishes. I’d make everything better for her."</P>
<p>"Just the fact that you wanna do that means your heart’s in the right place. It’s a bummer that some adults are so close-minded, and I know you hate to hear this, but whatever you do, it won’t be enough. There’s only two people who can make it better, and unfortunately, they happen to be part of the close-minded group."</P>
<p>Buffy smirked. Xander and Cordelia walked over.</P>
<p>"Not here either." Cordelia stated.</P>
<p>Buffy shook her head.</P>
<p>"We were just at the door. We didn’t see her." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Where would she go?" Cordelia asked.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>She hung back in the shadows as she watched the redhead sit in a pew.</P>
<p><I>‘Willow Rosenberg.’</P>
<p></I>The boss had sent her files on all the Slayer’s friends. There really wasn’t anything remarkable about them, except this one. She was an all around computer whiz. She was a brain, young, and an innocent. If she wanted to she could get rid of the redhead at any time, but the boss made her promise.</P>
<p>He said the best way to destroy your enemies is to know them first. So, that’s what she was doing. She listened as Willow spoke.</P>
<p>"I…I really don’t have anywhere else to turn. I need to talk and I was hoping you would listen. Maybe I’m not looking hard enough, but I can’t figure out what I’ve done wrong.</P>
<p>"I’ve always done everything my parents asked of me. Tried to please them and be what they wanted me to be. But I’ve grown, and I’m just started to find out who I am. My parents have been less than supportive.</P>
<p>"My father thinks I’m going against you and the teachings in the Torah. I’m not. I read from it, I come here for services, I light the candles on Hanukkah. If it’s about having crosses and stuff, I need them for protection.</P>
<p>"I know you know about the bad things here, and you have to want them gone too, right? I hope you’re watching over this town, well, because the person I love gets rid of them, and sometimes she needs help. She not only saves my life, but everyone in Sunnydale. My parents think she’s a bad person, but she’s not. Really."</P>
<p>"She? The redhead likes the ladies? Interesting." The girl said quietly.</P>
<p>"I’m a shy person, and a lot of times I keep quiet when I should speak out. For eighteen years I kept my mouth shut, and my parents and I were happy. The one time I follow my heart and do what I think is right, they punish me in the worst way.</P>
<p>"Buffy’s tried to help me, but it just isn’t enough. I hate feeling like this. Did I do something to deserve this? If I did, I wish you’d let me know, because I feel empty right now. I just want my parents’ love and support.</P>
<p>"Is that too much to ask?" She started crying softly.</P>
<p><I>‘Buffy, Buffy. Where have I –…no way. Her and the Slayer? Buffy Summers?’</P>
<p></I>"This is too good." The girl said, grinning.</P>
<p>Willow got up and walked out, and the girl followed her. Back inside the synagogue, a man was sitting in the front pew. He turned around, and looked at the door, guilt on his face.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back at the Bronze, Buffy and others were watching two people dance. The girl was dancing along with the beat of the music, but the guy was dancing faster. More like disco dancing.  </P>
<P>"What was the last thing that guy danced to, K.C. and the Sunshine Band?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>The couple stopped dancing when the girl pointed to the door. The guy nodded, and they started to walk out. </P>
<P>"I don't think that guy thrives on sunshine." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Buffy got up, and they all started to follow her. They got outside, and looked around. They didn’t see the couple, but they did see Willow walking up. Buffy turned to smile at her, and then put her finger to her lips.</P>
<p>Buffy walked forward.</P>
<P>"Where'd she go?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"I bet it's nothing. They're probably just making out." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>They heard a girl scream and some loud noises. Xander gave Buffy a stake.</P>
<P>"That's not what making out sounds like, unless I'm doing it wrong." Willow said.</P>
<p>Buffy grinned at her, and started making her way to the noise, the gang following her.</P>
<hr width=100>

<p>The girl who had been following Willow had heard Buffy and her gang coming. She was closer to the couple, and was trying to decide what to do.</P>
<p>"Well, this looks like a good time for an introduction."</P>
<p>The guy in the couple vamped out, and moved in to bite his ‘date’. The brown-haired girl grabbed the guy by his neck, pushed him away, and elbowed him in the face. He staggered back and regained his balance as she jumped onto a crate. She did a jumping roundhouse kick to his face, knocking him to the pavement.</P>
<p>	Buffy arrived with the gang. The girl noticed her and approached, smiling.</P>
<P>"It's okay, I got it. You're, uh, Buffy, right?"</P>
<p>Buffy was speechless. The vampire came up behind the girl and grabbed her by the shoulders. She snapped her head back, head butting him in the face. She grabbed onto his arm.</P>
<P>"I'm Faith."</P>
<P>She twisted the vampire around and shoved him into the section of chain link fence.</P>
<P>"I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's a new Slayer in town." Oz said.</P>
<P>Faith kneed him in the gut from behind. The vamp whirled around trying to backhand her, but she ducked. She then punched him in the gut and then again in the face. Everyone just watched her fight. </P>
<P>She did a high kick to the vampire's jaw, grabbed onto his shirt and neck and threw him to the ground. The vampire did a no-hand front roll to control his fall while Faith reached over to Buffy for the stake and took it from her.</P>
<P>"Can I borrow that?"</P>
<P>The vampire used the momentum of his roll to get back to his feet and ran at Faith, throwing a punch. She ducked, hooked her hand on his shoulder, turned him around, and pushed him back into the fence. She raised the stake and jammed it into his chest and took it back out. </P>
<P>The vampire turned to into dust. Buffy just stared. Faith faced her, handing back the stake.</P>
<P>"Thanks, B. Couldn't have done it without you."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They all entered the Bronze once more, and Faith told everyone about how her Watcher was at a retreat in England, and how she had come to Sunnydale to meet ‘the legend that is Buffy Summers’. Immediately after that quick explanation, she started telling the gang tales of her exploits.</P>
<p>"And all of a sudden, I hear this screaming from outside. So I go tearing out, stark nude and this church bus has broke down, and there's these three vamps feasting on half the Baptists in South Boston. So I waste the vamps, and the preacher comes up, and he's hugging me like there's no tomorrow, when all of a sudden, the cops pull up and they arrested us both."</P>
<p>"Wow. They should film that story and show it every Christmas." Xander said, salivating.</P>
<p>Cordelia slapped him. Faith took a bite of a muffin that the waitress brought over.</P>
<p>"Isn't it crazy how slaying just always makes you hungry and horny?" Faith asked Buffy.</P>
<p>Willow cleared her throat, and Buffy looked down at her lap.</P>
<p>"Um, Buffy? Could I talk to you a minute?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>Buffy nodded quickly and practically jumped off the couch. They both headed to the bathroom.</P>
<p>"What’s with them?" Faith asked.</P>
<p>"Oh they’re –" Cordelia started.</P>
<p>"Close friends." Oz said, putting a hand over Cordelia’s mouth.</P>
<p>"Yeah they’ll be fine. So got anymore stories?" Xander asked.</P>
<p><I>‘This is too easy.’ </I>Faith started thinking to herself.</P>
<I><p></I>"Well, I was wrestling this alligator –"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the bathroom, Buffy breathed a sigh of relief.</P>
<p>"Thanks for bailing me out. Something’s up with her."</P>
<p>"You mean you saw too? I mean come on, slaying doesn’t do that."</P>
<p>Buffy started to stutter.</P>
<P>"Right. Not at all. I just mean that her story seems a little shady."</P>
<P>"She doesn’t seem like the type to come all this way with an excuse to…"</P>
<P>"Worship my flawless slaying technique? Yeah, I caught that too." </P>
<p>"Well, she doesn’t seem the type to follow orders either. Maybe she did come here just like she said."</P>
<p>"Something still seems off. Anyway, what about you? Are you okay?"</P>
<p>"You’ll be able to tell if I lie, right?"</P>
<p>Buffy nodded.</P>
<p>"Well, then no."</P>
<p>"Is there anything I can do?"</P>
<p>"Just be here when I want to vent."</P>
<p>"Will do."</P>
<p>"I’m gonna go…maybe my parents have called."</P>
<p>"Okay. I should really take Faith to see Giles, and then I’ll be home."</P>
<p>"I’ll tell your mom to keep a plate warm."</P>
<p>"Thanks."</P>
<p>They kissed quickly, and headed back out.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy came back to the table.</P>
<p>"Willow went home. She said she’ll see everyone tomorrow."</P>
<p>"Is everything okay?" Faith asked.</P>
<p>"Yeah. She was just tired. But I should take you to see Giles."</P>
<p>"Awww! I wanna hear more. She was just about to –" Xander started to whine.</P>
<p>"I’d be careful, Xander. The hole that you’re in just keeps getting bigger and bigger." Oz said.</P>
<p>"What hole?" Xander asked, oblivious.</P>
<p>Cordelia glared at him.</P>
<p>"Oh. That hole."</P>
<p>Turning their attention back to Faith, they saw her confusion, and just a hint of worry.</P>
<p>"Your Watcher? Didn’t he go to England too?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Hey G, can I use your phone?" Faith asked.</P>
<p>"Of course. It’s in my office."</P>
<p>Faith walked into the office, and shut the door.</ P>
<p>Buffy turned to Giles.</P>
<p>"So?"</P>
<p>"Well…the retreat is every year in the Cotswolds. It's a lovely spot. It's very serene. There's horse riding and hiking and punting and lectures and discussions. It's... it's a great honor to be invited. Or so I'm told."</P>
<p>Buffy frowned, showing her sympathy for him.</P>
<p>"So, she’s telling the truth?"</P>
<p>"As far as I can tell."</P>
<p>"Something just isn’t…right."</P>
<p>"Are you sure you’re not reading too much into this?"</P>
<p>"Excuse me for being cautious. You know that thing you’ve been trying to get me to be for the last three years? And what happens when I finally do what you say? You turn it against me." Buffy huffed.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry. I could get in touch with the Council if you like."</P>
<p>"Thanks, Giles." Buffy replied sweetly.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the office, Faith was yelling at the person on the other end of the phone.</P>
<p>"You promised me that the story was airtight…no he didn’t go. He’s here. Well, fire them then…No, I’ll be okay. I’ll improvis e ." </P  >
<p>Faith paled.</P>
<p>"Sorry boss. Didn’t mean to blow off my steam at you. I’ll check in later." </P>
<p>She hung up, just as Buffy opened the door.</P>
<p>"Who’d ya call?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"A friend."</P>
<p>"Oh." Buffy said suspiciously.</P>
<p>"Speaking of friends, you and, what was her name?"</P>
<p>"Willow?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. You seem pretty tight."</P>
<p>"Yep. Good friends."</P>
<p>"Did you mow her lawn yet?" Faith asked wickedly.</P>
<P>Buffy swallowed hard.</P>
<P>"Excuse me?"</P>
<P>"What I meant –"</P>
<P>"I know what you meant. That’s a little personal, don’t you think?"</P>
<P>"We’re slayers. We have a bond. We’re supposed to share."</P>
<P>"We do? Guess I didn’t learn that."</P>
<P>Buffy walked out of the office.</P>
<I><P>‘She’s gonna be tougher than I thought. Might have to try a different angle.’</P>
</I>
<hr width=100>

<P>"Faith, do you have a place to stay?" Giles asked.</P>
<P>"I was able to score a room at this motel at the edge of town."</P>
<P>"Perhaps you would –"</P>
<P>Buffy shook her head at Giles, eyeing him.</P>
<P>"What was that?" Faith asked. </P>
<P>"Oh, nothing. I don’t think patrol is necessary tonight. Both of you should try and get a good night’s rest."</P>
<P>"Great! Thanks, Giles!" Buffy bolted toward the door.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy got home, and walked into the kitchen. Her mom was standing over the counter.</P>
<P>"Hey mom."</P>
<P>"Hi sweetie."</P>
<P>"Willow’s here, right?"</P>
<P>"She took dinner up to your room. It should still be warm."</P>
<P>"Thanks. Did Willow’s –"</P>
<P>"Yes."</P>
<P>"They did? What –"</P>
<P>"I didn’t tell her. It was her mom. She said her and her husband had thought it over, and they wanted to talk to me tomorrow."</P>
<P>"Are you gonna go?"</P>
<P>"They’ll want to ask me about you. And I don’t think it’s my place. I think you should go."</P>
<P>Buffy nodded in understanding.</P>
<P>"Willow told me about this new girl in town who is also…a Slayer?"</P>
<P>"If you’re gonna ask me what’s going on, you’re wasting your time cause I don’t have a clue."</P>
<P>"Does she seem capable enough to…take over?"</P>
<P>"The vote’s not in yet. I’m hungry so I’m –"</P>
<P>"Go eat."</P>
<P>Buffy smiled and headed upstairs.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"So what’s going to happen with Faith?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"I don’t know yet. Giles thinks I’m overreacting."</P>
<P>"You’re not, though."</P>
<P>"I’m glad you agree."</P>
<P>"Did your mom say anything about –"</P>
<P>"Nope." She hated lying to her, but she didn’t want to get Willow’s hopes up. "But don’t worry. I have a feeling things are going to get better."</P>
<P>"How do you know?"</P>
<P>"Just call it…a slayer thing." </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Tomorrow night’s the first round, fellas. Don’t screw up." Faith said.</P>
<p>In the corner, Kakistos smiled.</P>
<p>"Twenty-four hours from now, the Slayer’s blood will be flowing through my body."</P>
<p>"Just make sure you pick the right slayer."</P>
<p>Off in the far corner, Trick watched, and sighed.</P>
