<P>Buffy was heading back to the library after she finished patrolling. It
had been a slow night, only one little vamp , one little vamp that
couldn't put up a fight even if his life, well, unlife actually, depended
on it. <I>Maybe they had better things to do, God knows that even the
undead have a better love life than I do, </I>Buffy thought bitterly. It
was valentine's day and The Slayer was a little depressed over the fact
that she wasn't going to spend it with the one she loved. <I>Well,
technically you are, but not in the way you want to</I>, a part of her
brain reminded her. It was true. She was going to spend the night with the
person she was deeply in love with, there was only one tiny little
problem, this person had no idea that she was the object of the slayer's
affection. <I>At least I hope she doesn't.</P></I>
<P>Willow, her best friend, her best GIRL friend, and ,as of late, the
center of The Slayer's world. Buffy knew for sure that Willow would never
do anything to hurt her if she ever found out about these feelings , but
she also knew that the redhead could never return her love, so she just
kept her feelings to herself, savoring any kind of affection that the
hacker would throw her way.</P>
<P>When she first found herself thinking about Willow as more than just a
friend she tried to distance herself from the other girl, but she soon
found out that it was a lot easier said than done, since they lived in the
same dorm, went to the same university, frequented the same places, and of
course, the was that little matter of them battling the forces of darkness
on a daily basis. After a while she just gave up. Even if she could stay
away from the redhead she really wasn't sure if she wanted to. So love
took its toll and as the time passed Buffy found herself acting like any
other person in love did. During the days she spent as much time as she
could around Willow, many times going out of her way to do so, and at
night she occupied her dreams with images of the hacker. "Man, I got it
bad," she whispered as thoughts of the redhead filled her mind. Buffy was
so wrapped in her own world that she almost didn't hear her friend calling
out for her.</P>
<P>"Hey Buffy, wait up" Anya shouted, catching up with her friend.</P>
<P>"Hi Anya. What are you doing here?"</P>
<P>"Oh, I'm going to meet Xander at the library," Anya said turning her
head to the blonde before continuing, "We're going to the Bronze, they
have the whole valentine day's special tonight and Xander asked me if I
wanted to go with him, seeing as he is my boyfriend and everything and
this day is all about boyfriends and girlfriends and sex. This is my first
Valentine's Day, as a girlfriend I mean. When I was a demon this used to
be the best night of the year, boys buying bad gifts, cheating, it was
fun..." She said, reminding the good ol' days. "Anyway, how about you,
what are you going to do tonight? This must be a really hard day for you,
humm, seeing as you don't have a boyfriend or anyone."</P>
<P>"You know, you really need to work on that tact thing," Buffy
responded, suddenly wondering if a girl had to be tactless to get anything
from Xander. "I just finished patrolling and now I'm heading to the
library. I'm taking Willow home and then we're going to watch a few
videos. Since we're both flying solo we're not really into the Valentine's
Day spirit, you know, so we thought it was a good idea to do something
together," Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Oh, so you two are going to spend the night together? When you think
about it, it is kind of fitting. There's a lot of sexual tension going on
between the two of you, it was about time you did something about that.
Everybody was starting to wonder when the two of you were finally going to
work things out" Anya said, not noticing the increasingly angry expression
on The Slayer's face. Maybe that's why she was so surprised when she found
herself being shoved against a tree, an angry Buffy facing her.</P>
<P>"Anya, listen very carefully to what I'm going to say cause I really
don't like to repeat myself. First, there are no 'feelings' between me and
Willow that need to be 'assumed', okay? Second, you and the others should
really start bothering you own business and third, if I hear you keep
talking about this I'll forget that you are one of the good guys and will
kill you. Get it?" Buffy said through clenched teeth, backing off and
freeing the other girl. She knew that she was lying, she knew that there
were plenty of feelings to be assumed, at least on her part, but she also
wasn't about to admit to the former demon that she was in love with
Willow, she already had had a hard time admitting it to herself.</P>
<P>If Anya still had her demonic powers she probably would have hurt the
Slayer pretty badly, but as it was she just got as far away from Buffy as
she could, as she searched her memories for what could be considered a
good apology for what she had said. She knew that Buffy was still really
confused about the things she was feeling towards her best friend, and
maybe she shouldn't have talked so much about the subject.</P>
<P>"Buffy, calm down, okay? I-I'm sorry for that. I'm still new at all
these things and sometimes I go a little to far." Buffy raised her
eyebrows at that and she corrected herself, "Okay, okay, I go a little too
far a lot of time, but I'm learning." Buffy didn't respond , she just gave
Anya a little smile and nodded her head. Anya accepted that and they
started moving once again. The rest of the walk was very silent, neither
of them saying a thing. Each wrapped up in their own thoughts. After about
ten minutes they got to the library. It was empty.</P>
<P>"Will, Giles, anybody here?" Buffy yelled.</P>
<P>No one answered at first, so they just settled themselves, if there was
anything weird going on they'd come to the library. Twenty minutes passed
and nothing, and with that the girls started getting a little impatient.
Anya, by know being tortured by thoughts of Xander running off with every
female in Sunnydale, got up and started pacing around the place.</P>
<P>"I can't believe it. Xander ditched me. Our first Valentine's Day and
he ditched me. If I still had my power I'd..." Anya said exasperated
before being enveloped by strong arms.</P>
<P>"You would what? Kiss me to death?" Xander joked, trying to hug Anya
without Anya without dropping his snacks. "No one can resist the Big
Xand-man," he continued with a grin. Buffy, knowing that if she didn't
said something she'd have to end up watching another bickering session
between her two friends, or worse yet, a make out session. <I>Urgh.
</I>"So, where are the others? Willow said she'd meet me here."</P>
<P>"Oh, Giles left, he mumbled something about needing to stay away from
horny teenagers. Willow is at the computer lab, she went to check a few
class things on the computer" The boy responded before giving in to his
girlfriend's advances and kissing her.</P>
<P>The Slayer was about to make a comment about how gross it was for her
to have to watch to that display, when Willow entered the library.</P>
<P>"Okay, how many times do I have to tell you people that this is a
library, not a make out room." Willow said as she neared Buffy. Upon
hearing that they pulled apart and turned to face Willow, that was staring
reproachfully at them.</P>
<P>"You know Will, you're starting to sound a lot like Giles," Xander said
before sitting at a chair by the table.</P>
<P>"'I am not"</P>
<P>"Yes you are." "Am not."&nbsp;</P>
<P>Buffy, noticing that the argument could go on for a long time decided
to change the subject. "So, shouldn't you guys be going to the Bronze?
It's way past 9:30."</P>
<P>"Shit, we're going to be late," Xander said before he went to retrieve
their coats from Giles' office. The couple quickly put on their coats,
said their good-byes to the others and rushed out of the library doors.
"So, we should probably leave too." Will said after their friends
left.</P>
<P>"Yeah" Buffy said, turning to look at her friend ."Oh wait, I need to
give you something first." Buffy finished giving Willow a small
package.</P>
<P>Willow opened it and squealed in delight when she saw what was inside.
"Oh God, it's The Shadows book," she exclaimed before enveloping her
friend in a tight embrace. "Thank you so much. Where did you get it? This
book has been lost for decades," she said after they finally broke the
embrace.</P>
<P>"You're welcome. Do you remember that three-eyed demon that I fought
last week? Well, he kindly offered it to me, you know, after I punched him
till he bled," Buffy said with a smile on her lips.</P>
<P>"It's great, thanks, but you really didn't have to."</P>
<P>"I wanted to. It's Valentine's Day. The day you give or do something
special to the person that you care about. So I thought 'The whole point
of Valentine's Day is the fact that it's a day in which you cherish
someone you love, someone you care about'. So I asked myself 'If I wanted
to give something special to someone I care about, who would I give it
to?' Well, the only person I could think of was you." Buffy said. By the
time she finished she was convinced that she should never have given the
present to Will, and even more when she saw her friends surprised face.
"You think I'm a freak don't you," Buffy finally asked, after a few
minutes.</P>
<P>"Yeah, yeah, I think..." Willow said. When she saw the hurt look on her
friend's face she explained herself ."You are a freak, but you know what,
so am I," Will said before pulling a small box out of her bag and handing
it to Buffy. "Today I spent the entire day thinking about how people are
wrong when they say that this day is just to be celebrated between lovers
not friends so after much thought I decided that this year I would make my
own concept of valentine. So I got this for you ."</P>
<P>Buffy opened the box and inside she found a golden necklace. Willow
took the necklace and then told her friend to turn around so she could put
it on. After she finished Buffy turned around again and hugged her friend
tightly, tears falling from her eyes. "Thank you," she whispered in
Willow's ear before she let go of the redhead.</P>
<P>"You're welcome" Willow said, a little disappointed at the loss of
contact.</P>
<P>"You shouldn't have. It must have cost a fortune"</P>
<P>"I wanted to, besides it's not like I couldn't afford it" Willow said
with a grin. For a few moments they just stood there, staring at each
others eyes 'till Willow finally broke the silence. "So, shall we go?"
"Yeah, let's go"</P>
<P>Their ride home was very uneventful. During the way they talked bout
what they had done during the day and decided what they were going to eat
for dinner.</P>
<P>"Okay I'll call the pizza place while you take you shower and when you
finish I'll take mine while you wait for the delivery guy, okay?" Buffy
asked Willow while dialing the phone.</P>
<P>"Okay," Willow responded, already heading for the bathroom.</P>
<P>The time passed and soon they were settling in to watch the movies.
Willow sat in bed with her feet under her leg while Buffy sat in the same
position by her side. Around the middle of the movie the Slayer started
feeling uncomfortable. Willow, noticing her friends discomfort moved to
the head of the bed and told Buffy to lay down and rest her head on her
lap. The Slayer happily obliged. For hours they just sat there watching
the movie and enjoying each other's company.</P>
<P>When the last movie ended Willow looked down at Buffy and noticed that
her friend had a sad look on her face. "Hey, what's with the sullen
expression?" Willow asked, brushing a strand of hair from her friend's
face.</P>
<P>Buffy was startled out of her thoughts by Willow's voice. She turned
her head and looked at her friend, trying to decide whether she should
tell her best friend what was bothering her. "I was just wondering... Do
you think that there are people that go through life without ever finding
true love? You know, without ever finding someone to truly love, someone
to spend the rest of the life with?"</P>
<P>At first Willow was a little surprised at her friend's question but
after taking a look at Buffy's face Willow realized what her friend was
asking. "I do. I believe some people spend their lives looking for true
love but never find it. But I'm sure you're not one of them. These people
are the ones that more than anything want to be loved, but when asked to
love don't know how to do it. Since love is the kind of thing that only
works both way these people end up with no love at all. You're so
different from these people. You love, you love with all your heart and
all your soul. That's why I believe that someday you'll find your one. The
one you'll want to share your happy and sad moments with, the one whose
shoulder you'll cry on and whose arm you'll seek when you want to feel
safe. The one you want to sleep and wake up with everyday...the one you'll
give your heart to. Maybe this person will only enter your life in a few
years, or maybe she already did. But one think I know for sure: it'll be
worth the wait," Willow said, all the while looking Buffy straight in the
eyes.</P>
<P>"I don't think I will. "Buffy said, her voice soft and low</P>
<P>"What you're talking about, of course you will. You just have to give
it some time," Willow said, trying to convince her friend.</P>
<P>"You don't understand, what I'm saying is that I already found this
person, I already found the one," Buffy said, sitting up and turning to
face the redhead.</P>
<P>Willow's heart sank as she heard her friends words. <I>She's talking
about Angel</I>. Even though Buffy never mentioned it, Willow knew that
she missed her vampire ex-boyfriend. She had been there, she saw the
romance developing, she had been the person that Buffy talked to during
the good times and the shoulder was hers on which the slayer cried after
things got bad. She was there through the love, hate, pain and passion,
she knew the power of their love. For a long time she supported their
relationship, always thinking that the two of them were made for each
other, but somewhere over the past years something had changed, and now
just the mention of her friends ex-honey ruined her day. It was not that
she didn't like the vampire, she just didn't like what he represented.
Every time she though about him, about them, she would remember she and
Buffy would never have what the two of them had. Buffy would never love
her the way she loved her creature of the night boyfriend. She didn't know
why she was feeling that way, the only thing she knew was that every time
she though about him she would feel a big pain in her heart. She was hurt,
she wanted to cry, to yell, but somehow she managed to hold herself. She
knew that her friend was expecting her to say something, to ask something,
so gathering all the strength she could muster, she said, her voice barely
above a whisper. "Angel." It wasn't a question, it was a statement.</P>
<P>"No," Buffy responded while shaking her head, hands reaching up to
caress Willow's cheek.</P>
<P>When Willow heard Buffy 's response she felt like a big weight was
lifted from her chest, allowing her to breathe again.But now she was
extremely confused, if it wasn't Angel, who could it be? <I>Maybe... Yeah,
like that would that ever happen. Buffy would never fall for someone like
you. Get real</I>. The internal debate inside her head lasted for a few
minutes, until she got tired and realized that she had to know who her
friend was talking about.</P>
<P>"Who?" The question was simple, small, but to Willow it was a question
extremely hard to be asked, a question that no matter what the answer
would be, was going to change her life forever.</P>
<P>Buffy knew that this question would come sooner or later, she had
prepared herself, she knew what she wanted to answer but now that she
heard her friend asking it she didn't feel so sure of herself anymore. All
the fears and insecurities that didn't let her declare herself to Willow
sooner came back haunting her. <I>What if she doesn't feel the same way?
She will never want to see me again. </I>As these thoughts crossed her
mind Buffy seriously thought about interrupting that conversation. She
could tell her friend that she didn't want to say the name. Willow will
understand. She was startled out of her thoughts when she felt the warmth
of Willow's hand over her own, she stared at their hands for a few
moments, noticing how their hands fit together and how a simple touch from
the hacker could make her feel good. Buffy made her decision. Even if
Willow didn't felt the same way she had to tell the truth. She raised her
head slowly, and faced her friends piercing gaze. Their eyes locked.</P>
<P>"You." <I>That's it, I said it</I>.</P>
<P>Willow couldn't believe what she had just heard. Did Buffy really said
what she thinks her friend said? <I>It must be a dream, I'll wake up in a
few seconds and none of this will have happened. I'll still be in love
with Buffy and she still won't have a clue about it. Okay, why is it
taking so long for me to wake up? It usually happens when she declares
that she's in love with me</I>. <B>Well, maybe because you're not
dreaming, another part of her brain yelled</B>. <I>Of course I'm
dreaming</I>. <B>You're not. Come on I'll prove.</P></B>
<P>"Buffy, can you pinch me." Buffy gave her a confused look but complied.
"Wow, that hurt." Okay, I didn't wake up, which means that I'm not
sleeping. I told you so. "I'm not dreaming ... this was not a dream. Did
you really say the things I think you said?"</P>
<P>"Yeah... yeah, I did." Buffy really didn't know what to think. Willow
hadn't fled out of the room, which was a good thing, she just drifted to
her own personal world for minutes and when she snaps out of it she asks
Buffy to pinch her and then says something about being dreaming. Maybe she
is thinking that this was a nightmare ... or maybe she has been dreaming
about this moment too. Buffy was desperate to find out which one was
true.</P>
<P>"Will, please say something..."</P>
<P>"Buffy, I don't really know what to say," Willow said, squeezing her
friend's hand. "Which is kind of ironic considering the amount of time I
spend thinking about this moment" she adds in a thoughtful tone.</P>
<P>"You've thought about this?" Buffy asked, a smile forming on her
face.</P>
<P>"Buffy, I think about this, about you, every second of my day. I look
at you and all I can think about is how much I want to kiss your lips, to
hold you. Whenever I touch you I imagine what you be like to make love to
you. Sometimes I look at you and catch myself wondering how you would
react if you found out about my feelings for you." She stopped, thinking
about what she was going to say next. "When I first realized that I was in
love with you I was panicked. I mean, during my whole life I never had
felt anything for another girl. But then you came along and everything
changed. We became friends, best friends, and as the time passed I started
loving you. It was not like the love I felt for Xander, but it also was
not like the one I feel for you now. It was like a love between two best
friends mixed with romantic love, you know, like one took off certain
effects of the others. But then things started changing and this love I
felt for you also changed. The romantic love started to become too
overwhelming, and soon this balance ceased to exist and that was when I
fell in love with you."</P>
<P>Somewhere during Willow's speech, Buffy started crying. She couldn't
believe in what was happening. No more than an hour ago she was cursing
herself for falling in love for someone that she could never have and now
this very person was sitting in front of her, telling The Slayer that she
loved her. Willow saw as the tears started forming in Buffy's eyes and
gently reached her hand and wiped a tear that slid down her friend's
cheek. Their eyes met and soon their lips brushed in a tender kiss.
Willow's hands moved to the back of Buffy's neck, pulling her closer, as
The Slayer started teasing Will's lips, that opened slightly. Their
breathing grew more shallow as their tongues danced together. For several
moments they just kissed, tasting each other 'til they finally broke
apart, struggling for air.</P>
<P>"That was..." Willow said, still panting.</P>
<P>"Amazing," Buffy exhaled, overwhelmed by the intensity of the kiss.</P>
<P>"Yeah, amazing is a good word to describe it," Willow said as her lips
curved in a smile.</P>
<P>Buffy smiled back at her but then her expression turned serious.
"Willow, there's something I need to tell you"</P>
<P>Willow saw the serious expression in her friend's face and felt a cold
shiver pass through her body, but she just tilted her head, willing Buffy
to go on.</P>
<P>"Will, we've been best friends for years now. You're the person that I
trust and love more than anybody. Since the day we met I knew that there
was something special between the two of us, a kind of bond that would
last forever. Sometimes I think what I'm going to be doing, where I will
be in a few years and every time I think of myself doing something
different, going somewhere different, but no matter where I am or what I'm
doing you're always there, by my side. I would be lying if I told you that
I knew exactly when I fell in love with you. I think that unconsciously I
have always felt this way. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love
you Willow Rosenberg, I have for a long time now."</P>
<P>"Buffy... " Willow started to say only to be interrupted by the
slayer.</P>
<P>"Will, don't say anything, just hold me," Buffy whispered before being
pulled into Willow's arms. For a while they just sat there, holding each
other. It was Buffy who first broke the embrace. She didn't say a word as
she pulled slightly away from Willow and held out her hand to the other
girl. As they entered Buffy's room the slayer left Will in the middle of
the room and went to turn on her desk lamp, casting a faint glow over the
room. She moved to position herself in front of the redhead. "I want to
make love to you, Will," Buffy whispered huskily, stepping closer to
Willow and wrapping her arms around the hacker's waist, pulling their
bodies together.</P>
<P>Their lips met and soon they were kissing wildly. Buffy moved her lips
to Willow's neck, nibbling lightly and let out a low moan as the redhead's
hands crept under her shirt, gently stroking The Slayer's back. Feeling
the need to taste Buffy's lips again the girl put her hands behind the
blonde's neck and kissed her passionately. Buffy tightened her arms around
Willow's waist, lowering her onto the bed. They lay there in bed, still
kissing, as their hands ran over each other's bodies. As a need to feel
Buffy's skin against hers spread over her body Willow swiftly took off The
Slayers shirt and bra. She took Buffy's breast in her hands and squeezed
them softly, enjoying the feel of the girl's warm skin against her
fingers. Buffy arched into the caress, groaning in pleasure. Soon they had
successfully removed all of each others clothes. And as heir hands and
lips roamed over each others bodies, exploring, caressing and learning,
they made love for the first time.</P>
<P>A few hours later, after they had finished their lovemaking, they just
snuggled into each other's bodies and drifted off to sleep, happy with the
certain that they had finally found that part of themselves that they had
been looking for their entire lives.</P>
