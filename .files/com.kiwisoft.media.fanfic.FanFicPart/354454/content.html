<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 9: Freeing Willow -->

<p>"Ok, so that is all that we need?"</p>
<p>"Yes. This and your connection with Willow, and we should be able to open one of the gateways in the tent she's in. All we then have to do is to be fast enough there to free her so that she can open another gateway and then we should be able to-"</p>
<p>"Yes Giles, I think we got that. Ok then I'll tell Will that we're ready here."</p>
<p>"Ah.. yes, do that."</p>
<p>'Will, can you hear me?'</p>
<p>'No I can't but I will play the game. Ok so you are ready there?'</p>
<p>'Always up for a joke hah? And I thought that was Xanders way of thinking. Ok so we'll start now. Are you alone?'</p>
<p>'Just a second. Hmmm... yes, no demon in here.'</p>
<p>"She's ready."</p>
<p>"Then let's start."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Poor little redhead. Seems your friend doesn't love you as much as we thought."</p>
<p>Willow was startled as the demon appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"She didn't come. And she wasn't here. That means that she won't come. Bad for you. That means we have no use for you anymore."</p>
<p>'Buffy, hurry. I think they'll kill me if I'm not fast enough out of here.'</p>
<p>"Oh, believe me. She loves me. But she isn't stupid enough to step into a trap. And just for your information, Buffy and I had a wonderful night together."</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean that you thought you had her love... and I assume you also thought that you spent the night together. Ah, yes I can smell your arousal. But masturbation isn't the same than spending the night together and I would assume you know that."</p>
<p>"You don't seem to understand. I am more than you think. And I won't let you or anybody else hurt my Buffy."</p>
<p>And with that her head dropped, only to come up again a few seconds later, her eyes glowing and chants leaving her mouth. She didn't know where it came from, she just continued with what she was doing. The rope she was tied against started to glow and then fell off. She looked at the demon, her eyes almost drilling into its head. It couldn't move, couldn't speak. Then she raised her hands and threw the Weaver out of the tent. It smashed against a tree and was immediately dead.</p>
<p>'NOW Buffy!!'</p>
<p>She heard Buffy's words in her head but didn't have any time to listen to them. The guards ran into the tent and Willow did the same with them as with their comrade before. Then she started to feel a power. She couldn't resist it and started to chant again. She felt the energy streaming through her body and leaving her hands as she slowly opened the gateway.</p>
<p>Just in the moment when she was finished another two demons stepped into the doorway. If the gateway wouldn't have sucked them into it she wouldn't even have noticed them.</p>
<p>'Buffy, the hide spell!'</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Fast Giles, I need the hiding spell!"</p>
<p>"Just a second. Ah yes here."</p>
<p>Buffy took a short look at the spell in front of her and sent the picture of it to Willow.</p>
<p>She heard her as she used it. Then she saw through her eyes as the gateway started to disappear.</p>
<p>'Will, stay there. I'm coming. I'll be there as fast as I can.'</p>
<p>'Sure Buffy, no problem.'</p>
<p>She could almost see the smile her wicca must have had on her face now.</p>
<p>"Ok Giles, time to go."</p>
<p>She stood up grabbed the sword and the weaponry bag beside her and headed out of the door, shortly followed by Giles, Xander and Cordelia.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Buffy checked if the glasses were correct adjusted. Then she jumped out of the bush she was hiding in and ran as fast as she could towards the tent where Willow would wait for her. On her way she kicked 3 of the Illusion Weavers down and managed to slice the head off of them. Satisfied with her work she continued her run towards her friend. The closer she came to the tent the more she noticed that there didn't seem to be any of those demons left that attacked her. 'Damn they must have found out that there is a gateway in there. Or they're just scared. Whatever it is I should be grateful for it.'</p>
<p>Then she was hit and thrown through the air. She didn't know where it came from cause she thought she had checked everything in that direction. She did a second sweep with her glasses as she landed but wasn't able to see anything.</p>
<p>"Oh, little slayer... you don't really think I'm stupid enough to let you see me. I know how to avoid such things." What then followed could only be identified by maniacal laughter. Then she felt it. A prank that lifted her up in the air and threw her good 30 feet over to the tent.</p>
<p>"Big mistake, you bastard." 'Willow, you think you can make that one visible?'</p>
<p>'I can try, but I have to know where it is to track him down.'</p>
<p>'Ok next time he lifts me up you'll know where it is.'</p>
<p>'Buffy you can't be serious. He could kill you if you let him that near.'</p>
<p>'I really don't think I have a choi-'</p>
<p>Buffy was kicked over half the clearing and crashed right into a tree. The sword she had managed to hold until then dropped as the impact drove the air out of her lungs. Willow, who now knew where the demon was started to chant the short spell and only a few seconds later she and Buffy could see this one. It was bigger than the last one, almost 10 feet high. And it was fast. Almost too fast but Buffy managed to get up in time and duck under the punch away. And now that she could see it, it wasn't difficult for the slayer to repel the attacks. And after a little help from Willow, who managed to stop all the movements like with the first one, Buffy managed to break its neck and the demon dropped into a lumpy heap on the ground.</p>
<p>"Willow, do you think you could open a really big one above the clearing?" the slayer said walking over to her lover and with an almost wicked smile on her face.</p>
<p>"Ahh..hmm.. I think I could try that."</p>
<p>"You don't try it. Do it or don't do it that's all I want from you."</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>With that Willow started to chant, gathering all her energy together and a gateway formed. First small but steadily growing it sucked one demon after the other into it. Screams of agony could be heard throughout the whole forrest. Soon the clearing was absolutely quiet except for the walking sounds of the rest of the scoobies who came towards them. Willow collapsed on the floor completely exhausted. Buffy jumped over to her and caught her just in time to prevent her from dropping on to the ground.</p>
<p>'Hey Buffy, you think we should tell them now?'</p>
<p>'Why tell them and not show them?'</p>
<p>That was enough for Buffy to let her smile become wicked. Willow smiled back and only seconds later they stood there, kissing as if they have been years apart. Giles froze and just looked dumbfounded at the scene that was playing in front of him. Xander walked up to his side.</p>
<p>"Now just say you didn't know that."</p>
<p>"Know what?" Cordelia asked, as she was up to the other two. Xander just pointed at the two girls in front of him. The answer he received was Cordy's jaw hanging open while she stared at what just happened in front of her.</p>
<p>"Now come on, don't tell me I was the only one that knew this."</p>
<p>"Ah..yes... well... I think we should gather our stuff and go back home. And you two have quite some explaining to do, little girls."</p>
<p>"Giles, first we aren't 'little girls' anymore and second I think Willow and I have something else to do before, but we'll be there soon. And, no Giles, it is not what you think. I'll explain it later. But now we have a small date with some really old people."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"So here are we now. What to do next?"</p>
<p>"Now we'll teach you to work with what you have." A new voice entered the quietness around the willow tree.</p>
