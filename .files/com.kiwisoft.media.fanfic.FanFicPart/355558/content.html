<!-- Behind the Scenes \ Part 4 -->

<p>It was quiet in the small office that was generally referred to as "the
		writer room". Not far from this room, episode number 5 of the third
		season of "Kennedy High" was being shot. Normally, the writers took the
		day off on the first day of shooting a new episode. Mostly so that they
		could be on the set and interfere when need be. Now, however, they were
		having an emergency brainstorming session.</p>
		<p>Or at least, they were supposed to.</p>
		<p>What they were mostly doing was sitting around the room looking lost and
		helpless. Sarah was tapping on a sheet of infuriatingly white paper with
		a pencil, Helen stared out the window, Robert paced up and down and Jack
		was staring at ceiling, muttering "Lesbians... lesbians..."</p>
		<p>"OK, how about a traffic accident?" Sarah said.</p>
		<p>"What do you mean?" Helen asked.</p>
		<p>"Well, you know, Jeri or Alex has an accident and has to go to hospital
		and the other suddenly realises how much..." Sarah trailed off. "Too
		cliché, isn't it?"</p>
		<p>"I would go for too deus ex machina. No, that's not it," Robert said. "We
		need something else."</p>
		<p>"How about... how about..." Jack started. </p>
		<p>"How about what?" Helen asked.</p>
		<p>"How about, we have this cheerleading practise and Jeri suddenly	notices the extreme voluptuousness of her fellow cheerleaders."</p>
		<p>"Like in "But I'm A Cheerleader", you mean?" Sarah said.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah," said Jack.</p>
		<p>"Well, we might keep it in," Robert said. "Give the executives something
		to be happy about."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, like we really want to please them," Helen said
		sarcastically.</p>
		<p>"Speaking of happy, how 'bout a dream?" Sarah said.</p>
		<p>"What? One where Jeri suddenly starts having wild fantasies of her and
		Alex or vice versa?"</p>
		<p>"Well... in a way... yeah."</p>
		<p>"Can we do that in a plausible way?" Jack asked.</p>
		<p>"No," said Robert, sighing. "It's going to be contrived no matter how we
		do it. But we shouldn't make it look contrived. Or at least, not overly
		so."</p>
		<p>"Well, OK, how about we let Alex have the dream or whatever, but instead
		of immediately starting to lust after her stepsister, totally freaks out
		and starts acting even more hostile or something," Helen proposed.</p>
		<p>"Could be an idea," Sarah agreed.</p>
		<p>"Not Alex, Jeri," Jack said.</p>
		<p>"Any particular reason?" Robert asked.</p>
		<p>"Well... at least half the fanbase already thinks Alex is gay anyway and I
		don't think she'd freak too much when she had a lesbian dream even if she
		wasn't, if you know what I mean. Alex is the kind of gal that keeps an
		open mind. Jeri isn't. Jeri would really freak and worry and whatnot and...
		well... we could easily fill an entire episode with her."</p>
		<p>"Point taken," said Robert.</p>
		<p>"So we're going with the dream thing?" Helen asked.</p>
		<p>"If you have any better ideas, I'm open," said Robert.</p>
		<p>"The dream thing it is," Helen said.</p>
		<p>"And the cheerleader thing. For that extra bit of freakage we may
		need."</p>
		<p>"You're just saying that 'cause you like to have sexy shots with girls in
		tight outfits," Sarah said.</p>
		<p>Jack smirked. "True. But then again, so do you."</p>
		<p>"Shut up."</p>
		<p>"OK people!" Robert said, clasping his hands together, grinning with
		confidence. "It's writing time!"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Because of the popularity of "Kennedy High" and a very shrewd manager,
		Brooke could afford a villa. But, then again, she could also afford a
		drug addiction.</p>
		<p>She had neither, since she didn't feel like she needed either of
		them.</p>
		<p>Instead, she lived in a small apartment by herself along with her cat,
		which she had named Detritus since he kept ruining the curtains and
		couches.</p>
		<p>Brooke was now lying on one of said couches, reading through the script
		of the newest episode. She didn't particularly like it. And not just
		because the episode started with extensive shots of her and Sam in
		several different states of dress and undress. She disliked it because
		she was the main main character for the ep, which meant she had to learn
		the most lines.</p>
		<p>Ah well, nothing for it.</p>
		<p>The phone rang.</p>
		<p>Grateful, Brooke flung the script onto the coffee table.</p>
		<p>"Hello?" she asked into the receiver.</p>
		<p>"Brooke? It's Nicole. Have you read the latest script?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah," Brooke said.</p>
		<p>"Do you want me to ask Mary Cherry for one of her cyanide pills?"</p>
		<p>"That's a kind offer, but I think I'll pass. Detritus, no!"</p>
		<p>"Pardon?"</p>
		<p>"Sorry, the cat wants to know if he can sharpen his claws on my
		script."</p>
		<p>"Hey, let him," Nicole said. "That way you don't have to look at it any
		more."</p>
		<p>"I still need to learn my lines, though," Brooke said.</p>
		<p>"Only wussies learn lines. True professionals improvise."</p>
		<p>"Nicole, how did you ever become an actress?"</p>
		<p>"By sleeping with the right people."</p>
		<p>"Oh right. I forgot."</p>
		<p>"You know, I bet if you slept with Jack he'd probably be willing to
		change the script in your favour."</p>
		<p>"I don't think he wrote it. I think it's a Sarah episode."</p>
		<p>"What? The cheerleader thing is definitely Jack."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, but Micheal's mom is allowed to make another appearance, which
		basically means that it's Sarah."</p>
		<p>"You're right. Let's play it safe then. You sleep with Jack, I sleep with
		Sarah."</p>
		<p>"Nic, have you no shame?"</p>
		<p>"Of course not," Nicole answered. "Who needs it anyway. Just gets in the
		way. But, joking aside, don't worry. This thing has "ratings stunt"
		written all over it. Jeri'll be back to her happy straight self next
		episode."</p>
		<p>"You're right, Nic, it is a ratings stunt," Brooke said.</p>
		<p><i>Just not a one-time ratings stunt,</i> she thought.</p>
		<p>"See?" said Nicole. "Don't worry. Just get through this, find a nice guy
		and then you can forget all about it."</p>
		<p>"Here's hoping," said Brooke.</p>
		<p>"Well Brookie, it's been fun, but I've got an appointment with my
		manicurist, so I gotta go."</p>
		<p>"Bye Nic."</p>
		<p>"See you on the set."</p>
		<p>The phone went dead. Brooke placed the receiver back in the cradle and
		picked up her script again. She opened it where she had left off and
		started reciting the lines to herself, trying to ignore the scratching
		sounds made by Detritus and the wallpaper.</p>
