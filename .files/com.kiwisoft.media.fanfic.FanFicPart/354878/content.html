		<p>Today Lieutenant Torres and Seven of Nine came to sickbay. Voluntarily. A rare occurrence as I might mention. They seemed to have sleep walked and wanted me to 'heal' them. I tried to explain to them that sleep walking can't be cured like some disease, but they insisted to be checked for illness, both claiming that it was the first time something like that had happened to them, so it must be unnatural.</p>

		<p>I checked them and found indeed something. Both have a chemical imbalance in their nervous systems, an identical imbalance. I have not yet informed them of my findings for I first wanted to be sure, but it seems like the Lieutenant and Seven are mentally linked. Not on a conscious level, they would be able to read each other's thoughts that way, but on a subconscious level. This would mean those two are not only sharing quarters but also dreams. I have not yet determined the cause of this link, but my best guess would be that they got infected with some kind of neurological virus on the last away mission.</p>

		<p>I am thankful that they were the only crew members that beamed down on that planet. So they are and will be the only ones infected, because this virus is non contagious. I have no cure yet, but it seems to be harmless for Seven and B'Elanna. I still need to inform the Captain and my two patients.</p>
