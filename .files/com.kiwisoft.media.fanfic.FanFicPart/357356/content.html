<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 5-->
<p>Brooke ran her hand long Sam's side lightly tracing the expanse between the
brunette's hips and breasts.  They were lying on Brooke's bed side by side
as the blonde carried out her experiment.  They had hardly spoken since
leaving the kitchen, they hadn't needed to, their actions flowing naturally
from each other.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam breathed out softly, her breath hitching in her throat.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," the cheerleader responded distractedly as she began to trace
patterns over the top of Sam's shirt.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?"  Brooke stopped her movements as Sam posed her
question.  She supposed it was possible that the brunette was referring to
their current situation, but she knew that that wasn't the case.  Sam, as
always, was looking at the big picture.  She didn't want to know what they
were going to do a minute from now or an hour from now, she wanted to know
what they were going to do about the situation, what they were going to do
about them and what it mean to their lives.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes-which had been following her hands-turned to look up at Sam
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she responded truthfully.  "I know that I've been…the
dominate personality so far, but I don't have any more of an idea about
what's going on than you do.  This is all new to me.  These feelings…that I
have for you, I've never felt like this before."</p>

<p>"Not with…" Sam started to ask, but Brooke beat her to it.</p>

<p>"No.  That was the problem.  That's why it's now a 'was'," Brooke responded
softly.  "This," she said shifting closer to Sam as her hands began to
explore again unconsciously, "is something…have I already used new?"  She
asked smiling self-consciously.</p>

<p>"Once or twice," Sam responded looking down at Brooke's face.  The blonde's
eyes were darker than she had ever seen them and there was a perpetual flush
to her cheeks and agitation in her movements.</p>

<p>"We can't stop," Sam stated a moment even though it came out sounding more
like a question.  As she spoke, she considered whether she truly believed
that she could stop wanting Brooke, and the answer she kept on getting was
in the negitory.</p>

<p>Brooke regarded Sam carefully, studying her face, her eyes, her lips as she
thought about the question.  After a moment, she then leaned forward and
brought their lips together tenderly.  Wrapping the hand that had been
exploring Sam's side around her body she moved closer to Sam hugging her as
she continued her gentle exploration of the other girls mouth.  This wasn't
the fiery embrace they had held each other in earlier, but something
entirely more intimate, soft, more loving.  The hunger that had consumed
them earlier had been replaced with a sort of quiet wonderment and awe at
the depth of emotion they inspired in each other, yet with an underlying
fire.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think we can," Brooke whispered once they parted.  "Now that we
know…what it's like," she continued observing Sam.  "Even if we stopped…I
think…no, I know I would always still…" she let the sentence hang, choosing
instead to simply look at the brunette.</p>

<p>"This is going to get complicated," Sam commented as she brushed a strand of
hair out of Brooke's face tenderly.</p>

<p>"Going to?" Brooke asked smiling softly.  "I'd say it's already a complex
mess of complications.  Not even broaching the serious social implications
of our new union, our very nuclear familial situation leads to a whole new
set of problems.  After all, we are practically sisters.  Not to mention
that our parents are coming home soon and no matter how hard I try to
control them my hands just seem to wonder all over your body in a way that
is not at all sisterly AND they do this in very, very noticeable way."</p>

<p>"That was very comforting.  If I could have drafted up a list of all the
things not to say in response to my statement I still wouldn't have come up
with all the things you just mentioned," Sam muttered leaning into Brooke
nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Sam…" Brooke whispered softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, just shut up," the brunette responded silencing whatever Brooke was
going to say with her lips.  Talking about their situation wasn't going to
do either of them any good at that time.  Things were how they were, and it
was obviously clear to both of them that situation wasn't going change, even
if it would be easier for them to just forget about it.  They were under
each others skin now, and they would just have to burn their bridges
whenever they came to them.  What was important then and there was simply
that they were together, and that's what Sam wanted to concentrate on.  The
world could be put on hold for the time being.</p>
