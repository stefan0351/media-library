<!-- A Connected Love \ Prologue: The Beginning of all -->

<p>In the beginning of all, the mortal realm was empty. No life was there. No demons. No angels.</p>
<p>But then the power of darkness discovered this realm and sent his minions out to take it over, just like it did with so many others. But this realm was different than the others. It had a power contained in it that was greater than both the powers of order and chaos together. And it used it. It created life. It didn't want to have other creatures on its surface. But most lifeforms were either destroyed or not bothersome enough to be anything else than ignored.</p>
<p>But then the mortal realm created mankind.</p>
<p>The first humans where strong enough to survive and intelligent enough to understand the mortal realm and help it to banish the demons from this place.</p>
<p>And they fought a war. Hiding and always trying to get the overhand over the evil powers here. But they weren't strong enough. They had managed to repel some of those creatures but the highest powers of evil noticed what happened here and sent out the army they used in their eternal conflict against the powers of the light.</p>
<p>And it was a disaster for the mortal realm. Almost all humans were killed before the things changed. It was when the forces of light found out what happened here. They studied this realm. Tried to find out why it tried to defend itself from the powers of evil. And it sent ambassadors to this realm. Tried to find what gave it the strength to create life.</p>
<p>But these ambassadors were fought and expelled from here not knowing that this realm may have found an ally in its war against the forces of evil.</p>
<p>But the forces of light didn't give up. They had found out what powers this place used and wanted to use them for themselves or at least prevent the darkness from achieving them.</p>
<p>And they made an offer to the mortal realm. They wanted to help this realm banish all demons from it by sending out two warriors that would connect to this realm and use its powers to defeat the demons. All it wanted for that was a place to rest and recover during the war between them and the darkness.</p>
<p>And the mortal realm accepted. It selected its best warriors and they were given the powers of the two best warriors in heaven. The first received the power to fight the demons the second to use the magic of the mortal realm.</p>
<p>And they fought. Fought together to banish all demons from this place. And succeeded. But the forces of evil didn't want to loose this place as they saw the way to win over the power of light with the powers contained herein. So it created passageways to this realm. Hellmouths. And was able to return to the mortal realm. Only to be banished again from this world.</p>
<p>But the forces of evil still didn't give up. They started to fight in darkness, hiding from the powers and attacked when they didn't expect it.</p>
<p>So the mortal realm closed the Hellmouths but couldn't destroy them. The demons that were still here managed to hide. They started to use the human bodies as container for their essence. And managed to survive the counterattack of the powers of good, so that they could hide until the evil powers managed to reopen the Hellmouths and attack again.</p>
<p>Those two fighters for good were a Warrior-adept of using combat weapons of all kinds from hand to hand to men big swords-and a Sorceress-adept in using all kinds of magic-. Both linked together through the power of the mortal realm and protecting it from the beginning by wandering from one body to the next and using the powers they had, to keep the evil forces in this place at bay.</p>
<p>Until the evil entered this realm again...</p>
