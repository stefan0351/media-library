<p>Olivia lay in her bed, she was woken by a tapping on the window and saw Sebastian standing in the rain she moved to the window and opened it and Sebastian climbed in. Olivia pulled him into a hug, it felt like the carnival all over again then as Sebastian kissed her, all the feelings left Olivia, this wasn't how it was supposed to feel. She pulled away backing out of his arms.</p>
<p>"This isn't right", cried Olivia, her voice sounded far away, not her own.</p>
<p>"What isn't?", asked Sebastian again trying to move her into his arms.</p>
<p>"You", said Olivia turning away.</p>
<p>"Is this better", asked another voice. Olivia looked up to where Sebastian had been standing a minute ago, now stood Viola, not dressed as Sebastian but in a beautiful Black dress that hugged her in all the right places.</p>
<p>Olivia gasped and didn't resist as Viola pulled her into a hug, stroking Olivia's hair Viola began to speak but Olivia cut her off, gently placing her lips on Viola's. The kiss was perfect even better than the one at the carnival, and Olivia gasped as she felt Viola pull her closer deepening the kiss. Before Olivia knew it Viola was on top of her ravishing her body, her clothes disappear and as Viola made her way down Olivia's torso, Olivia screamed with joy.</p>
<p>"Yes oh God, yes!" yelled Olivia, as Viola reached her goal.</p>
<p>"VIOLA!" screamed Olivia, sitting right up in bed, she looked around, thankful that she didn't have a room mate, that would be awkward to explain. Olivia examined the room, and breathed deeply she was sweating all over, Viola had made her sweat all over.</p>
<p>Olivia grimaced at the thought, Viola had done this to her, she was... developing attachments for the fiery brunette, Olivia sighed who was she kidding she loved Viola just as much as she had loved "Sebastian" and she never had dreams like that with "Sebastian". Looking under the covers Olivia laughed, and if she did have dreams for "Sebastian" they most certainly never did that.</p>
<p>But Olivia wasn't gay was she, turning to face the clock, Olivia saw it was 12am, she really needed to sleep and wasting time with her inner debate was not going to help her for tomorrows pop quiz, so she settled down again and thought about the brunette smiling to herself as she dreamed.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to Olivia the object of her affection was just a couple of meters from the room. Moving with stealth like motion, Viola crept under the window of Olivia's room, crouching low and sticking her head up she could just make out Olivia's sleeping form. Viola opened the window quietly and moved into the room, she would have to wake Olivia up to apologize it really didn't count if she was asleep.</p>
<p>So Viola moved over to the bed and gently shook Olivia, Olivia woke at once looking up into Viola's eyes, she screamed, Viola feel back in horror and landed on her butt. Olivia turned on the light and sat up in bed.</p>
<p>"Get out of my dream", yelled Olivia before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>Viola grinned on the inside, in her dreams well that had to be good. Looking up at Olivia she stood up trying to calm the other girl.</p>
<p>"Liv its me, don't panic", said Viola.</p>
<p>Olivia cursed herself for speaking and nodded weakly as Viola stood before her, giving the girl permission to continue.</p>
<p>"please just hear me out, dating me isn't any different to dating Sebastian, or who you thought was Sebastian. I'm still the same person", tried Viola.</p>
<p>"Yeah the lying one", said Olivia, she hadn't meant to be so rude, but she had yet to get any proper sleep and both times she was woken by this girl.</p>
<p>"No please look when you kissed me.. I... we changed.. I care about you." tried Viola, she was crashing and burning but she needed to get this out.</p>
<p>"Just get out", said Olivia, she didn't want to have this conversation didn't want to have to make a decision she just wanted her old life back, and more to the point sleep.</p>
<p>"And I know you care about me too, please just think about it", said Viola as Olivia stood up from the bed, walking towards the door.</p>
<p>"Thought about it, over it... now get out!" Olivia opened the door, gesturing for Viola to leave.</p>
<p>Viola moved towards the door.</p>
<p>"Fine", replied Viola, stepping out of the door but before Olivia could shut it she lent back into to capture their lips. Olivia didn't fight back and was about to respond when Viola pulled back. Viola looked at Olivia expectantly, Olivia simply avoided her gaze and stepped around the other girl, Viola was certain Olivia would chuck her out now, but Olivia simply closed the door and came to stand in front of Viola.</p>
<p>Olivia then laced her hands behind Viola's neck and kissed her, gently edging them both towards the bed, as Olivia gently pushed Viola to sit on the bed, Olivia removed the other girls T-shirt in one fluid motion, pushing her the rest of the way down lightly, straddling Viola's hips as they continued to kiss.</p>
<p>"So I take that as a "I care about you too"?" asked Viola, pulling away to breathe, and smiling up at Olivia.</p>
<p>Olivia stopped and stood quickly, Viola's smile faded.</p>
<p>"I cant... I can't do this", said Olivia, pulling away and moving towards the door, Viola stood too not sure what to do, she couldn't bare to see Olivia upset.</p>
<p>"Shh its okay... I didn't mean it like that we don't have to do anything", Viola pulled Olivia to her chest, resting her chin on Olivia's head. Olivia felt safe, as she took in the smell of Viola, without her shirt on Viola held her in just a bra and jeans, Olivia felt Viola's burning skin against her cheek and kissed Viola's neck cautiously, then she leaned up to kiss Viola sweetly.</p>
<p>"Lets just take it slow and just lie down.. to sleep", added Viola leading Olivia to the bed.</p>
<p>As they climbed in together, Viola held Olivia as they both fell asleep, even after everything that had happened Viola felt that this moment right now sure as hell made up for it.</p>
<p>Olivia woke up to feel Viola still holding her, she glanced at the clock. 3Am, rolling over in Viola's embrace she was amazed to find Viola still awake, she smiled up at her.</p>
<p>"Everything okay?", asked Olivia, playing with a loss strand of Viola's hair.</p>
<p>"Yeah.. I just... I think I love you", said Viola uncertain, she glanced away not sure how Olivia would take it.</p>
<p>"I think I love you too", said Olivia pulling Viola back to face her and into another searing kiss.</p>
<p>"So do you want to stay the..."Olivia paused to look at the clock, again "Rest of the morning".</p>
<p>"I'd love to but I really should be getting back", Viola said getting up, as she was about to find her T-shirt she felt Olivia grab her hand, looking back down Viola gulped as Olivia gave her a pout and licked her lips.</p>
<p>"Or you could stay", said Olivia seductively.</p>
<p>"That could work", replied Viola falling back beside Olivia.</p>
<p>They kissed briefly, before Viola started kissing down Olivia's neck, trying to remove her nightshirt as she went. Once that was removed, Olivia was in nothing but her lacy bra and panties, Viola grinned as she took in the newly exposed skin.</p>
<p>"Has anyone ever told you that your beautiful?", asked Viola, moving hover above her girlfriend and leaving innocent kisses just above Olivia's cleavage.</p>
<p>Olivia gasped, "I only believe it from you", she gasped again as Viola undid her bra.</p>
<p>"Oh god... take me Viola", said Olivia, as Viola ran her tongue over Olivia's right nipple.</p>
<p>Viola pulled back suddenly.</p>
<p>"Thats the... you called me Viola without whacking me", said Viola smiling, as she moved up to Olivia's face.</p>
<p>Olivia nodded, some what confused.</p>
<p>"Well that is your name", said Olivia, missing the attention she had been receiving moments before.</p>
<p>"I mean its just the first time you haven't called me Sebastian, and I just..." started Viola but Olivia placed her finger to Viola's lips.</p>
<p>"I love you, not Sebastian", said Olivia.</p>
<p>"I...I... thank you", said Viola, she had tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Olivia brought their lips together again and Viola remembered where she was, moving to Olivia's left nipple and trailing kisses down her torso. When Viola reached Olivia's pantie line she stopped leaning on her elbows she looked to Olivia for confirmation and as Olivia nodded not taking her eyes off Viola, Viola knew they were ready.</p>
