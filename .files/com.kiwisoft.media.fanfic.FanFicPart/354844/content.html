<!-- World Without Love \ Part 8 -->

<p>Seven wanted to continue, but was interrupted by a delighted shout from her little friend Naomi Wildman.</p>

		<p>"Seven!" Naomi had just come into mess hall in search of her godfather Neelix and hadn't expected Seven of Nine to be there. She ran to Seven's table, which earned her a frown.</p>

		<p>"Naomi Wildman, you should not run in the mess hall," Seven said with a stern voice, but the smile that barely touched her lips let Naomi know, the ex-Borg was only teasing.</p>

		<p>Only then the young half-Katarian saw B'Elanna, "Hello Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna who had silently watched the little interaction between the two answered, "Hi, little one. What's up?" The half Klingon had no experience with children and was a little uncomfortable and she was still baffled by Seven's words about her being Klingon. She was not sure what was more frightening that she herself didn't notice it or that there was now someone who knew her well enough to see something like that. She abandoned all thought of that and tried to concentrate on what Naomi was saying.</p>

		<p>"Not much, I am just in search of Neelix and didn't want to ask the computer where he is," Naomi seemed to have no problems talking and had sat down at the table, "but that is not important, may I stay with you?"</p>

		<p>"Of course, Naomi." Seven was quick to answer, she liked the little girl and had not had much time to speak or play with her in the last days. "Perhaps, this would be a good time to ask the Lieutenant you question?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna looked questioningly at Naomi still surprised how good Seven was in handling the kid. "A question?"</p>

		<p>Now Naomi was looking uncomfortable "Err, yes Lieutenant. I wanted to ask you, if you could teach me about the warp core," the little kid nervously asked.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was genuinely surprised. "Me? Why didn't you ask Seven, I am sure ....." B'Elanna was robbed of the chance to continue, being interrupted by Seven.</p>

		<p>"I gave her the advice to ask you, for it is your warp core after all," the ex-drone explained.</p>

		<p>"Isn't Engineering in your curriculum?" B'Elanna asked the child.</p>

		<p>Naomi nodded, "Yes it is, but Vorik insists on 'proper order' and he says, he will teach me about the warp core at the end of the class." Naomi was pouting, obviously not agreeing with the Vulcan Ensign.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna considered her decision a moment, but then decided to give in, "Okay, I will do it, but only, when I have the time, is that all right with you?"</p>

		<p>The kid was beaming, she hadn't expected the half-Klingon to say yes, but was all the more delighted that she had said 'Yes'.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so much, Lieutenant," Naomi said and got up from her seat to give the surprised chief engineer an enthusiastic hug.</p>

		<p>Seven who was observing them was beaming, too, never had she thought B'Elanna could be that good with kids. She gazed lovingly at her, but made sure that B'Elanna didn't see it. Naomi however was another issue, she saw the gaze, and even though she was still a child, she knew what such a look meant.</p>

		<p>That was the moment when B'Elanna was hailed by Vorik, "Vorik to Lieutenant Torres."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna seemed to hesitate unwilling to answer and break the moment, but she did so though. "Torres here, yes Vorik?"</p>

		<p>"Sorry to interrupt, but we need you down in Engineering, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>The chief engineer gave a brief nod, although Vorik couldn't see it and said, "I will be there shortly, Torres out."</p>

		<p>She was about to apologize to Seven and Naomi, but Seven stopped her, "It's okay go, hail me when you need help." Torres nodded and then proceeded to Engineering.</p>

		<p>Seven had no idea what that meant for her and just a sentence from Naomi later she wished she had accompanied B'Elanna. "Do you love her?" the little kid asked. The former Borg was not often speechless, actually she had never before been speechless, but Naomi's question made her just that. Seven was completely honest to herself and others and she didn't know how to answer, because she really had no idea whether she loved B'Elanna or not. The only thing Seven knew was, she wanted to be with her, talk with her, feel her... Was that love?</p>

		<p>"I am not sure, but I believe yes." Even Seven was surprised by her own words. The last part had come out without her even thinking about it and it was not what she had wanted to say.</p>

		<p>"That is great, Seven, does she know?" Seven did not know that much about children, but was quite sure that children shouldn't ask such questions. After all what could a little child know about love? Seven thought about that and decided that she knew perhaps more than she herself did.</p>

		<p>"No. I am unsure, if she would welcome my feelings," Seven was uncomfortable discussing this with little Naomi.</p>

		<p>So she was glad when Naomi herself ended the talk, "Perhaps the Captain could help you, oh there is Neelix, bye Seven." And Naomi was away. Saved by the Talaxian.</p>

		<p>Seven thought about what the half-Katarian had said and decided she was right. So she stood up and walked away from mess hall to speak to the captain.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Kathryn was surprised when Seven came into her ready room, once again unannounced. But seeing the look on Seven's face she once again decided to overlook this breach of protocol. 'Sometime I am going to tell her to stop doing this,' she thought to herself, but knew in her heart this wasn't going to happen. She somehow liked that Seven wasn't always following protocol, at least the ex-Borg wasn't doing it in not dangerous situations.</p>

		<p>"So what brings you here, Seven?" she asked.</p>

		<p>And Seven told her, what had her so confused and uncertain as to what to do now. Janeway was astonished but not that taken by surprise, she had seen something like that coming, with B'Elanna and Seven being so obviously made for each other. The captain however did not know how to proceed. What do you tell a Borg in love? Kathryn silently made her decision and then gave Seven, who was waiting, her answer.</p>

		<p>"Seven," Kathryn took a deep breath and then continued, "when you fell as deeply for B'Elanna as you claim, and I know you do, then you should tell her. There is no guarantee that she reciprocates your feelings, you will just have to take the chance."</p>

		<p>Seven was obviously not satisfied with that, but just nodded. "Thank you, captain, I will tell her how I feel." And with that she left Janeway's ready room, leaving behind a captain who was feeling like she had just seen her daughter growing up.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Confess your feelings, the captain had said more or less. And that Seven was now determined to do. B'Elanna and she were in B'Elanna's quarters talking about how they could save energy, for Voyager was still running low on Dilithium after the incident in the nebula. Seven was not quite listening, concentrating more on gathering up the courage to tell the Klingon how she felt.</p>

		<p>"Seven, hey, are you listening?" B'Elanna asked having caught up on Seven's inattention.</p>

		<p>"No, I was thinking about. I need to tell you something," she began. B'Elanna was feeling apprehension, experience had taught her sentences starting like that were no good.</p>

		<p>The ex-Borg was unsure as to how to proceed, but finally decided to just say the truth and continued, "I am feeling attracted to you." Trying to process what her friend had just said, B'Elanna was dumbfounded. She knew that she felt something for Seven, something strong, but that was something she had tried to avoid the last few days and she was not at all ready or prepared when Seven leaned forward and kissed her gently on the mouth. So she panicked. She pulled away from Seven, immediately missing the sensation of Seven's lips on her, but her panic quickly overrode that feeling.</p>

		<p>"I, .... I," she didn't know what to say so she simply ran away as she had always done, when confronted with something she was unable to handle. She turned and fled from her own quarters, leaving behind a sad and confused Seven.</p>
