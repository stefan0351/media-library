<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 33: Lance in the Pants -->

<p>Rebecca woke to see the tall gunslinger staring out the window,
		mug in hand. "'Morning," she said with a yawn.</p>

		<p>"'Morning," Josie replied, her gaze never leaving the
		bustle of activity at the saloon. She recognized the long, flat wagon of an undertaker
		sitting outside. Rebecca trudged over to the small table and picked up the tin mug.</p>

		<p>"Josie, where's my coffee?" she asked as she looked at
		the empty cup. She received a sheepish grin as the gunslinger held out the mug she was
		holding. The young woman took the half-empty cup and frowned. She downed it in a few
		swallows and set it on the table. "You know, Josie, if I got up before you and drank
		your coffee, you'd have my head on a stick."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but you'll never wake up before I do," the
		gunslinger said confidently, turning her attention from the activities outside and looking
		at the young woman. Josie looked back out the window, but not before seeing the blonde
		stick her tongue out at her. She watched as the canvas wrapped body was placed in the back
		of the wagon and the sheriff exchanged words with the undertaker. The man with the badge
		looked at the corpse in the wagon and shook his head. The undertaker shook hands with him
		and both men went on their way. Sandy left the saloon and headed up the street towards the
		boarding house. "We've got company, Rebecca."</p>

		<p>The young woman was dressed and ready by the time Sandy knocked
		on the door to their room. "How'd it go?", Josie asked as the blonde madam
		entered the room.</p>

		<p>"Just like you said it would. Old man Henry is taking him to
		the dirt pile now," she said. The gunslinger gave a grim smile of satisfaction. With
		no doctor in town, it was up to the undertaker to decide if an autopsy was called for and
		apparently the old man wasn't interested in trying to keep the body until one could be
		called from another town.</p>

		<p>"Good," Josie said as she flopped down on the bed,
		guns, boots and all. It had been a long night and the news that it was over finally gave
		her a chance to relax. She closed her eyes, hoping that today would be a lazy day and she
		could catch up on her sleep.</p>

		<p>"How's Stacey?" Rebecca asked as she motioned for Sandy
		to sit at the table with her. The young woman had no doubt that Josie had stayed up the
		remaining hours until dawn. She deliberately kept her voice low, hoping that the
		gunslinger would get some much-needed rest. Sandy understood and kept her voice at the
		same low level.</p>

		<p>"She's doing better. Elaine managed to keep her quiet and
		hidden when the sheriff was around. Poor thing's pretty shook up, though."</p>

		<p>As they spoke quietly about the previous night's events, Rebecca
		glanced over at the bed frequently, checking on her friend. It wasn't long before Josie
		was in a deep and apparently peaceful sleep. "Sandy..." she whispered, and
		pointed at the sleeping gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Come on, Rebecca. I'll buy you breakfast," the madam
		whispered back.</p>

		<p>As quietly as possible, they left. The sound of the door closing
		woke Josie, but after a second of deliberation, she decided that they'd be fine and rolled
		over and went back to sleep.</p>

		<p>Sandy took Rebecca to the small restaurant. The same waitress was
		there, but this time she was much more pleasant and gave them a table near the pot-bellied
		stove. The young woman was quite happy at that, since the coffeepot was kept warming
		there. She quickly helped herself to a cup while waiting.</p>

		<p>"I guess they let anyone in here," a woman said to her
		husband as they passed their table. Sandy gave her a withering glare. The pompous woman
		let go of her husband's arm and turned to face them with her hands on her hips. "I
		heard that Sam Hutchins died there last night. No doubt fitting punishment for visiting a
		whore." She turned her attention to Rebecca. "And what's this?</p>

		<p>A new one? How old are you, child? Seventeen? Eighteen? You
		should be home, learning cookin 'n sewin and worrying about finding yourself a
		husband." She paused for a moment to study the face before her. "You're pretty
		enough; shouldn't have no problem finding yourself a man."</p>

		<p>"Now you look here, you high and mighty bitch!" Sandy
		said rising to her feet. Rebecca rose as well, hoping to avoid a conflict in the middle of
		the restaurant.</p>

		<p>"Ladies!" she said, putting her hands up to silence
		them. "Please." She looked at the indignant woman and her cowed husband.
		"Ma'am, we just want to get something to eat. You were leaving, weren't you?"</p>

		<p>"It's bad enough you have that brothel of sin and booze. You
		should keep yourselves there and not come out to sully a fine respectable place like
		this." She looked at Rebecca and went on, "I won't stand by and watch a new one
		like this come in and corrupt our fine men." Her face twisted with self-righteous
		anger and hate as her body tensed, ready to strike.</p>

		<p>"Sweetheart?" Everyone turned to see the brown headed
		young man approach.</p>

		<p>Rebecca breathed a sigh of relief as she recognized Lance. The
		woman relaxed her body, clearly confused. Lance stepped close and kissed the blonde on the
		cheek. "So you did decide to have breakfast with your aunt. I wish you would have
		told me, darling. I was worried."</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked at him blankly for a moment before she caught on.
		"Uh...yeah." She forced a smile to her face, not that it was too hard seeing as
		how he just swept in and rescued her from trouble. "I should have told you." She
		turned to her companion and continued, "Aunt Sandy, this is Lance." Sandy
		quickly put a happy smile on her face and she held her arms out.</p>

		<p>"Lance darling, so nice to finally meet you. Rebecca has
		told me so much about you." They embraced as though truly glad to see each other.</p>

		<p>Thoroughly embarrassed, the woman said gruffly to her husband,
		"Come on, Harold," as she headed for the exit. Rebecca barely suppressed a
		giggle as she watched them leave. She smiled and held her hand out, pointed at an empty
		chair.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so much. Please join us."</p>

		<p>Lance smiled at his good fortune and quickly helped both women
		with their chairs before taking his own seat. Rebecca smiled at him and he smiled back,
		neither one of them speaking. Sandy watched the interaction and smiled to herself. Ah,
		young love. So pure and sweet in its innocence. Rebecca briefly explained to her that they
		had met before as she continued to smile at Lance.</p>

		<p>The waitress brought their food and set it down gently on the
		table in front of them, frowning slightly when she saw the young man. "You have to
		eat something to stay here," she said firmly.</p>

		<p>"Oh, dear me," Sandy said rising once again to her
		feet. "I have to get back. Lance, would you be a dear and escort Rebecca back to the
		saloon after she finishes? You're welcome to mine," she said as she pushed the plate
		in front of him. She opened her purse to pull out money, but the young man held his hand
		up.</p>

		<p>"Please, let me. It would be my sincere pleasure." He
		turned back to Rebecca. "Would you like some more coffee?" He was already moving
		out of his chair and reaching for the potholder hanging on a hook next to the stove. Sandy
		looked at her, silently asking if she'd be all right. Rebecca smiled and nodded slightly.
		Lance leaned over and filled her cup, smiling at her the entire time and almost spilling
		the coffee. Sandy smiled and gracefully left them alone.</p>

		<p>"So, Rebecca ...are you new to Cheyenne?" he asked as
		he buttered her bread for her.</p>

		<p>"Thank you," she said accepting the bread from him with
		a smile, "We're just passing through, actually." She took a small bite of her
		bread and returned the coffee mug to her lips, looking over it at the handsome young man.
		Rebecca was acutely aware that the toes of their boots were touching. "And you?"</p>

		<p>"We moved here about six months ago, from Tucson. We have a
		small cattle ranch a few miles out of town," he said, completely mesmerized by the
		green eyes looking at him from beneath soft lashes. "You are very beautiful," he
		murmured, smiling when her cheeks flushed pink and she looked down at her plate.</p>

		<p>He reached out and took her hand in his own. "I mean it,
		Rebecca. You truly are a work of art, worthy of being in one of those museums in New York
		City."</p>

		<p>"Stop," she said, embarrassed. "You don't know me,
		Lance." She gently pulled her hand back to her lap, noting that it was the first time
		a man had touched her so gently.</p>

		<p>"I'd like the opportunity to get to know you better,
		Rebecca," he said sincerely. "And I hope the feeling is mutual."</p>

		<p>Rebecca's heart picked up its pace slightly. This well mannered,
		handsome, charming gentleman was trying to court her. She put her hands on the table and
		found them instantly encased within his warm and gentle ones.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The sun was high in the sky when Josie woke. She looked around
		for a moment before remembering that Rebecca had gone to eat with Sandy. She got out of
		bed and stretched before reaching down and scratching the area under her breasts while
		yawning, looking every bit like a bear coming out of hibernation. She looked out the
		window. Horses, wagons, and people all filled the street as they went about their
		business. Her eyes narrowed when she saw the familiar blonde head walking arm-in-arm with
		a man. She looked closer and realized that it was the boy from the theater. Her jaw
		clenched unconsciously when she saw him put his arm around Rebecca's waist. It took less
		than four strides of her long legs to reach the door.</p>

		<p>Sandy stared at the clock nervously. Josie would kill her if she
		knew she had let Rebecca out of her sight, the madam was sure of it. Her quiet friend
		didn't speak of why she was traveling with the young woman, but Sandy knew from watching
		the gunslinger that Rebecca was special to her. They hadn't gone 'round the mountain yet,
		Sandy was certain of that, especially after talking with Elaine. She knew the blonde was
		no relation of the half-Cherokee, but she couldn't think of any other reason for them to
		be traveling together. If not for love or money, then why? And what of Rebecca's reason
		for being with Josie? Sandy found it most interesting that the gunslinger made no mention
		of any recent robberies and in fact the madam realized that she hadn't heard anything
		about the raven headed woman since the news article quite a while back about the robbery
		in the mid-west, which reported the death of the outlaw. Perhaps the young blonde had
		something to do with that. Certainly Josie seemed more at ease around people since the
		last time she'd seen her, and the way she had held Rebecca after the shooting was most
		surprising to the madam. She had no idea Josie could be so gentle and caring.</p>

		<p>The madam breathed a sigh of relief when she saw Rebecca and
		Lance enter the saloon, only to see Josie come in just seconds behind them. She took a
		quick note of their position and headed straight for Sandy. "I thought you were going
		to keep an eye on her," she said in a disapproving tone, then stepped back a bit when
		she realized just how much like a mother hen she sounded. The madam decided that a change
		in subject was the best course of action. "Josie, how about you and me go in the back
		room and play some pool?" she suggested. She moved closer and lowered her voice.
		"I'll even throw in a jug of cactus juice I've got hidden back there." She
		followed the gunslinger's line of sight back to the couple sitting opposite each other at
		a small table in the back.</p>

		<p>"Come on, Josie, let those kids have some fun. It looks like
		he's quite taken with her."</p>

		<p>"Yeah...well, he'd better not get too taken with her. He
		won't be a happy person if he does." Her tone was serious enough to make the madam
		gulp nervously. She'd seen Josie in action and knew just how swiftly she could cut a man
		down. Sandy looked at the couple again. They were just quietly talking, each with a
		sarsaparilla in front of them. She hoped for Lance's sake that he was as much of a
		gentleman as he seemed.</p>

		<p>Josie realized that she was feeling more anger toward the young
		man than she should have. He had done nothing out of the ordinary and Rebecca seemed happy
		enough. 'Get a grip Josie,' she chided herself. 'If she wants to spend time with him, well
		that's just fine with me. We don't have to spend all of our time together.' With that in
		mind, the gunslinger turned and headed to the back room, followed closely by Sandy.</p>

		<p>Rebecca turned her head slightly to watch them go into the back
		room.</p>

		<p>Lance's back was to the door and thus he didn't see the glare
		given him by the gunslinger. She wondered briefly why Josie didn't come over to talk to
		her, but was drawn back to Lance by a polite cough. "Oh, I'm sorry. What?"</p>

		<p>"I asked if you would do me the honor of accompanying me
		tonight? My father is having a barbecue to celebrate his forty-fifth birthday. Nothing
		fancy, just a bunch of the ranch hands and some friends of the family," he said
		quickly, his nervousness showing through. He flashed her a hopeful smile.</p>

		<p>"You can even bring your mother along if you want to,"
		he said, receiving a guffaw from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Lance, she isn't my mother. She's just a friend."</p>

		<p>"Oh," he said, embarrassed.</p>

		<p>"It's all right," she said, still grinning. "We
		get a lot of funny looks." She decided not to tell him that most of the looks were of
		fear of the tall, intimidating gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Well, if you want, you can bring her along, I guess. I'm
		sure my mother will keep her company," he offered, willing to do anything to get the
		beautiful blonde to accept his offer.</p>

		<p>"No. I don't think your mother and Josie would have much in
		common to talk about," she smirked as she thought about the possible conversations
		between the two women. Lance's mother trying to talk about the recent harvest and the
		gunslinger talking about why Colt Peacemakers are the best shooting irons around. She gave
		a small giggle at the thought. Lance smiled, although he didn't get the joke.</p>

		<p>"So will you? Go with me, I mean?"</p>

		<p>"Um..." she flashed him a shy smile. "...yes, I'd
		like that," she said. He relaxed visibly and let out a deep breath as he ran his hand
		through his hair.</p>

		<p>"That's great! Um...I'll pick you up at six...uh, I don't
		know where you live," he said apologetically.</p>

		<p>"I'm staying at the boarding house."</p>

		<p>"Fine. I'll pick you up there at six."</p>

		<p>"That'd be nice," she replied, wondering why her heart
		was racing again.</p>

		<p>Then she realized that this was the first time she was going on
		an actual date.</p>

		<p>"Well, I'd better get back to the ranch before pop has a
		fit," he said as he stood up, taking her hand into his and kissing it. "I'll see
		you tonight, fair lady."</p>

		<p>"Oh..." She rose to her feet and nervously pulled her
		hand back. "Tonight then," she said as she watched him leave. When he was no
		longer in sight she turned to go find Josie and instead she saw Victoria leaning against
		the upstairs rail. With a wave and a smile she went to go visit with her for a little
		while.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie checked and double-checked the angle and position of the
		balls before taking her shot. With a crack, the cue ball struck the nine ball, just off
		from where she had intended it to, sending the white ball into the side pocket. "I
		thought you were good at pool, Josie," Sandy said as she refilled the gunslinger's
		glass again.</p>

		<p>"I would be if the cues weren't warped," she
		complained, turning the stick in her hands to study it. "And if you would stop trying
		to get me drunk," she added half-jokingly as she pulled the cue ball out of the
		pocket and handed it to the blonde madam. Sandy smirked and handed Josie the full glass.</p>

		<p>"I have to do something to have an even chance, don't
		I?" she said as she took aim, sending the nine ball into the corner pocket easily.
		"After a while, you get used to the curves of the cues. Don't even notice
		anymore." She set the cue against the wall and sat down on the couch. "I do
		believe it's your turn to rack them."</p>

		<p>It was after three when Rebecca came down and knocked on the
		door. She poked her head inside and looked at Josie. "Can I talk to you?"</p>

		<p>"Come on in, Rebecca," Sandy said as she tossed her
		stick on the table.</p>

		<p>"I've got to get ready for tonight anyway."</p>

		<p>"Josie," she began hesitantly after the madam left.
		"Lance has asked me to his ranch for a party tonight."</p>

		<p>"Have fun," she replied with no sign of emotion.</p>

		<p>"Well..." Rebecca turned, but not before Josie saw the
		look of hurt on her face. "I guess I'd better get back and get ready."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, wait," she said as she walked over and closed
		the door. "Sit down." They each took a seat on the couch, Josie mentally
		chastising herself for not realizing how much the young woman was looking for her approval
		and encouragement. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound like I didn't care. I do
		care."</p>

		<p>"You think I'm just a child, Josie. I'm not." She was
		upset enough to let her hurt and anger through. "I wasn't asking your permission,
		Josie. I was trying to share something important to me with you."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I don't think you're a child."</p>

		<p>"Really, Josie? What was that look when you saw Lance and me
		together? You didn't look happy."</p>

		<p>"I..." She scrambled to explain what she felt when she
		saw them together. "I was just surprised to see you with someone other than Sandy,
		that's all.</p>

		<p>Call it my protective nature." She forced a toothy smile,
		hoping to lighten the mood. Rebecca relented, unwilling to remain angry with her best
		friend.</p>

		<p>"Okay, but I really do need to get going." She looked
		down at her dress, trying to smooth out the wrinkles, then down at her boots. Josie caught
		the look on her face and frowned in understanding. A quick mental count told her she
		didn't have enough money to get Rebecca both a nice pair of shoes and a new dress. There
		was a flicker in her blue eyes as she thought of a solution to the problem.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, go on to the house and get washed up. I'll be
		there in a little while," Josie said handing her the money to pay for the bath. When
		their hands touched to exchange the bill, Josie gripped it for a moment. "In the
		bottom of the saddlebag on my side is a small bottle of Katec toilet water. It's strong,
		so don't drown yourself with it." The smile she received was worth far more than the
		two bits the perfume cost. After Rebecca left, the gunslinger smiled to herself and headed
		upstairs.</p>

		<p>The bathtub was located in a back room downstairs. The lock was
		nothing more than a piece of wood nailed to the door that turned to block it from being
		pulled open. Looking at it as she turned it into position, Rebecca decided that even she
		could pull the door open, the nail hole worn enough to allow the wood to swivel easily.
		One good tug and it was certain to fall to the floor. She silently wished that she had
		known so she could have had Josie stand outside the door. Too late now, she mused as she
		removed her clothes, setting them in a small pile on the floor, save the dress, which she
		draped on a nail sticking out of the wall for just such a purpose. She placed her clean
		underdrawers and slip on the small shelf and carefully stepped into the clawfoot tub.</p>

		<p>She had been soaking for some time when she heard the firm but
		non-threatening knock on the door. "Rebecca?"</p>

		<p>"Hang on, Josie," she said, climbing from the tub and
		wrapping a towel around her. She turned the lock and opened the door enough to poke her
		head out.</p>

		<p>"Let me in." The look on the gunslinger's face reminded
		Rebecca of her sister's face when she was giving someone a present. She stepped back and
		let Josie in, closing and securing the door behind her. She was holding a light green and
		white lace dress as well as a pair of white button down boots. "I thought you might
		like to wear this to the party," she said as she set the boots down and hung the
		dress up, tossing Rebecca's old one on the floor with the rest of the dirty clothes.
		"I couldn't afford both, but Sandy found the dress in one of the closets. I think
		it'll fit you just right," she said, not bothering to mention that it took her the
		better part of an hour to find and purchase the boots. She was not expecting quite the
		reaction she got. Rebecca's eyes filled up and she gave Josie the best imitation of a bear
		hug she could, before softening it and laying her head on the older woman's chest.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Josie," she murmured, her hand splaying out
		and rubbing up and down the gunslinger's back slowly. The movement of her upper arm caused
		her towel to fall open exposing her whole back as it hung loosely, trapped between their
		bodies. Josie was returning the embrace when she felt the smooth skin beneath her fingers
		instead of the towel. Rebecca made no effort to move when she felt the strong arms wrap
		around her bare skin and squeeze gently. After a moment, a feeling of awkwardness set in
		for the gunslinger and she reached down and gathered the ends of the towel, securing it
		back around her friend's body.</p>

		<p>"I guess I'd better let you get ready." She turned and
		reached for the door handle. "Is this their idea of a lock?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah," Rebecca replied, still staring in awe at the
		new dress and boots.</p>

		<p>"I'll be outside when you're done," Josie said
		authoritatively. She took a quick look to make sure the blonde was still covered before
		she opened the door and stepped out. Another boarder was in the adjoining parlor and
		glanced in her direction. One quick glare from her and his attention went back into the
		week old newspaper in his hand.</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked in the small mirror, trying to see as much of
		herself as she could. As Josie had predicted, the dress fit perfectly, although it was a
		bit snug in the chest, she thought as she looked down to see exactly how much cleavage was
		showing through the white lace that started barely above her nipples. To her relief, the
		lace was intricate enough to cover everything, although it still clearly defined her
		pushed up bosom, making her appear larger than she was used to, and causing her to feel a
		bit self conscious. She looked down at the delicate boots and smiled again. They were
		completely impractical for traveling and were clearly an indulgence on Josie's part. The
		boots had to have taken up most of the money not set aside for supplies. Rebecca ran her
		fingertips across the pearly buttons. "Oh Josie..." she whispered as a teary
		smile came to her face. She picked up the boots in one hand and her dirty clothes and
		traveling boots in the other, pressing the garments against her body to keep them from
		falling, and opened the door.</p>

		<p>Josie immediately moved from her position leaning against the
		wall to help Rebecca with her clothes. "Give me those. You don't want that clean
		dress to smell like your dirty clothes, do you? Come on." As they went upstairs,
		Josie's boots struck the wood in sharp contrast to the young woman's bare feet. Once
		inside the room, the gunslinger put the boots in the corner and the clothes in the growing
		pile of laundry in the other corner. Rebecca sat down on the bed and pulled her leg up
		over her knee to put on her boot. She slipped the leather and cloth over her foot,
		frowning when she realized that the buttons were on the outside. "Why do they do
		that?" she grumbled as she tried to reach around and fasten the buttons. Josie
		chuckled and knelt down in front of her.</p>

		<p>"Let me," she said as she pulled Rebecca's ankle off
		her knee. "They button on the outside because they expect all 'ladies' to have
		someone helping them get dressed." Her nimble fingers worked quickly, securing all
		the small buttons up the calf.</p>

		<p>"Well, it seems a little silly, doesn't it?" Rebecca
		replied, surprised at the gentle manner in which Josie put her foot into her boot. She
		held the calf with one hand and gently slipped the shoe part of the boot onto the young
		woman's foot, then rested the foot back on the ground before methodically buttoning it.</p>

		<p>"That's why I don't wear them. Just like corsets,"
		Josie replied as she stood up. "Okay, let's get a look at you."</p>

		<p>Rebecca stood and self-consciously turned around in place. She
		stopped and watched the gunslinger's gaze go up and down her body slowly, as if memorizing
		her. "Josie? How do I look?"</p>

		<p>"Beautiful," she replied, suddenly realizing that her
		mouth was quite dry. She swallowed and looked into the blonde's eyes, unnerved by how deep
		the green seemed to be in them, almost an emerald color. 'You are no child, Rebecca,' she
		thought to herself as her eyes drank in the vision before her. 'No child at all.'
		"You'll be the prettiest one there," she said with a teasing glint in her eyes.
		"Now just try not to get sauce all over the front of your dress. I know how you
		eat." She followed her words up with hand gestures depicting a most unladylike manner
		of eating.</p>

		<p>"Oh, you...." Rebecca huffed playfully. "This from
		the woman who makes noises with her armpits."</p>

		<p>"Hey, I told you I have many skills."</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, and that's one that'll be sure to land you a
		husband." She didn't understand the knowing smirk that came to the gunslinger's lips.
		Rebecca was about to comment on the look when the church bell chimed off in the distance,
		drawing her attention to the time.</p>

		<p>"Oh no, he's going to be here any second," she gasped
		as she raced around in search of the brush. "Oh Josie, my hair is a mess and-"</p>

		<p>"Relax, Rebecca. Here." She pulled the brush out from
		the saddlebag and walked over to the window. "Stand here and watch for him. I'll take
		care of your hair."</p>

		<p>As promised, Josie gently brushed Rebecca's hair while the blonde
		watched the street below. The green eyes were half-closed in enjoyment of the unexpected
		luxury of having someone else do her hair. Long fingers aided the brush through the soft
		blonde hair. The strokes were far gentler than she had ever done for herself and Rebecca
		made a mental note to ask her to do it again sometime, perhaps in exchange for a backrub.
		Josie always did like backrubs. The young woman smiled at the thought. She enjoyed giving
		massages to the gunslinger, to run her fingers over the strong muscles, to hear the soft
		murmur of relaxation that came from her mouth. She wished Josie would ask for one more
		often, not just when she was in pain.</p>

		<p>The sound of a wagon approaching drew her focus away from the
		spot on the wall it had strayed to during the brushing and back down to the street below.
		"He's here," she whispered nervously, pulling the gunslinger from her musings as
		well.</p>

		<p>"Oh," Josie replied, setting the brush down on the
		table. She put her hands on Rebecca's shoulders and turned the smaller woman to face her.
		"Listen to me. Have fun, enjoy yourself, but be careful." She didn't even
		realize that her voice was in 'mother' mode. "I know you're a grown woman and what
		you do is your business, but remember that you don't have to do anything that you don't
		want to do."</p>

		<p>"Yes, mother.", Rebecca said with a smile as she tried
		to cover up her nervousness. It didn't work.</p>

		<p>"You'll be fine; stop worrying," Josie said
		reassuringly. "You'd better go before he thinks you've stood him up."</p>

		<p>"Oh...bye," she said as she headed out the door, only
		to turn around and give her friend a quick hug. "I'll be back early...I
		promise." Then in a rustle of skirts, she was gone .</p>

		<p>Josie stood at the window, watching as Lance put a soapbox on the
		ground for Rebecca to use as a step to get into the wagon. Despite her upbringing, Rebecca
		acted every bit the proper lady, holding her hand out to be assisted up the step, sitting
		with her hands crossed over each other in her lap. The only thing missing was a hat.
		'Damn, forgot about the hat', Josie thought to herself. 'How could I forget that? Oh,
		Rebecca, I hope no one mentions it.' She watched the wagon until it was no longer in sight
		before turning away from the window. Josie lay down on the bed with her fingers interlaced
		behind her head, staring at nothing. What had happened at the saloon? Why did she get so
		angry whenever she saw them together? She blew stray strands of hair out of her eyes as
		she let out an exasperated sigh. She should be happy that Rebecca had found a nice young
		man to give her attention. From what the gunslinger could gather about the young woman's
		past, something not spoken of any more than her own, she wasn't used to receiving such
		positive attention. Josie rubbed her eyes. Sitting here staring at the ceiling wasn't
		going to help her understand. She rose to her feet and set out for the saloon.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The wagon moved slowly out of town, the pale gray of evening
		settling around them like a dark blanket. "You look very beautiful," Lance said
		as he admired the vision sitting next to him.</p>

		<p>"Thank you," Rebecca replied softly, finding herself
		unexpectedly shy. "Lance, you don't sound like you come from these parts. Where are
		you from originally?"</p>

		<p>"Well, our family is from back east, near Albany. We moved
		out here about two years ago. Pop was a banker; came out here to settle down and raise
		cattle," he looked out at the setting sun. "Don't think he expected it to be so
		hard, though." He smiled and took her hands in his hand, the reins tangling between
		them. "But I guess it's worth it to see such a pretty girl as yourself. But how'd you
		know we weren't from around here?"</p>

		<p>"Your accent," she replied. "You have one, even if
		you don't realize it.</p>

		<p>Like coffee. You pronounce it caw-fee."</p>

		<p>"I do not have an accent," he said indignantly.
		"Only people from the south and from New England have accents."</p>

		<p>"You do. Listen...coffee...walk...you say them," she
		said. He repeated the words. "See? Caw-fee and wok. You have an accent.", she
		said triumphantly. Lance nodded in defeat.</p>

		<p>"I didn't know. You're very intelligent as well as
		beautiful, Rebecca.", he pulled her hand up for a kiss. She smiled, thinking how nice
		the attention was, then discreetly pulled her hand away, thinking that a refined lady
		would do the same. Lance smiled and untangled the reins, shifting in his seat and leaning
		forward to watch the road in the dimming light. For several minutes there was no sound
		save the steady rhythm of the horses hooves against the ground and the creak of the wagon.
		"Rebecca, if she's not your mother, then why do you travel with her?" he sat up
		in his seat and looked at her. "You have to admit she's not like most women."</p>

		<p>Rebecca grinned. "No, she's not. But that's part of what
		makes her so special. She is different. Maybe she doesn't fit into the mold of a perfect
		lady, but generally, I think proper ladies are boring. Josie's fun; you never know what to
		expect next from her. It's exciting." She didn't even realize how big her smile was
		when she spoke of her friend, but he noticed.</p>

		<p>"She looks like the kind that likes trouble. Seems to me
		you'd be better off settling down somewhere."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'll settle down eventually. I just haven't seen enough
		of the world to decide what I want to be yet."</p>

		<p>"Want to be? What do you mean, want to be? Don't you want to
		be a wife and mother like all women?"</p>

		<p>"Well, of course I do, Lance," she said huffily, not at
		all happy about having to defend herself. "It's just that I want more than that.
		Lance, I want to learn about medicine; how to help the sick and injured. I want to do more
		than cook and clean and raise babies," she quieted down as they passed through the
		gates to the ranch.</p>

		<p>"Seems to me that's all any woman would want," he said,
		keeping his eyes straight ahead as his perfect vision was shattered.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"You didn't remind me about a hat," Josie growled to
		Sandy as she entered the saloon and bellied up to the bar. "What if someone says
		something to her?"</p>

		<p>"Josie..." Sandy motioned behind the gunslingers back
		at the barkeep to bring the bottle along with the glass he was holding. "I didn't
		think about the hat. She'll be fine. Rebecca certainly is pretty enough to go without a
		hat." She poured a glass of whiskey and pushed it in front of the raven-headed woman.</p>

		<p>"Did you find the boots you were looking for?"</p>

		<p>"Yes." The blue eyes lit up with rare excitement.
		"They fit her perfectly. You should see them, Sandy; nice white leather with
		shimmering white buttons like pearls. She looked so nice in them and in the dress too. You
		had her size right." Josie stopped when she realized just how much she had said and
		how she had said it. She quickly drained her glass and refilled it.</p>

		<p>"I wish I had remembered the damned hat," she mumbled
		into the glass.</p>

		<p>"Next time you'll remember the hat, Josie. In the meantime,
		the girl is out having fun, why don't you? There's fresh cigars in my desk and the pool
		table is free," she suggested, trying hard to keep the smirk off of her face. The
		tall gunslinger was acting like a typical mother worrying about her child's first date.
		'That girl's got something on you Josie, I can feel it,' the madam thought to herself.
		'You've changed and I'd swear on a stack of bibles held by Saint Peter himself that it's
		all because of that girl.'</p>

		<p>"Fine...beats sitting around here looking at all these
		codgers," Josie grumbled, breaking Sandy out of her reverie. The gunslinger grabbed
		the nearly full bottle and they headed for the back room.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Rebecca, this is my mother and father, Mister and Mrs. Jon
		Van Doren."</p>

		<p>Lance turned to face his parents. "Mother, Father, this is
		Rebecca."</p>

		<p>Mr. Van Doren kissed the back of Rebecca's hand, and Mrs. Van
		Doren smiled and said, "Nice to meet you, Rebecca...?"</p>

		<p>"Cameron, Rebecca Cameron. Pleasure to meet you as
		well," she replied, leaning down to accept the offered kiss on the cheek.</p>

		<p>"Ah, well now Rebecca, we've met before, haven't we?"
		Lance's father asked. Like his son, he never forgot a pretty face.</p>

		<p>"Yes, at the theater," she replied, instantly
		regretting it when she saw the look on the older woman's face, that of a cat about to
		pounce on an unsuspecting mouse.</p>

		<p>"Ah yes, the theater. Lovely establishment, wouldn't you
		say? Not nearly as grand as say, the Palace, but still rather nice for such a rustic
		area." She turned to see if there was anyone around who was more important she could
		talk with, and finding none, she returned her attention to the young woman.</p>

		<p>"What were we talking about? Oh yes, the theater. You were
		there with your mother, weren't you?" Lance opened his mouth to correct her, but shut
		it when he felt the gentle poke in his side.</p>

		<p>"The actors were very funny, didn't you think?" Rebecca
		asked, trying desperately to change the subject.</p>

		<p>"The actors? Oh, I suppose so." She dismissed the topic
		with a wave of her hand as if it was not even worth discussing, and then went on.
		"But tell me dear, why does your mother wear your father's clothes? And in
		public?" she said in a disapproving tone. Rebecca's mind raced quickly as she tried
		to come up with an acceptable explanation.</p>

		<p>"Oh, well, you see...that's for my benefit. You see, if
		people see her like that with me, well, they just assume that she's a man and they don't
		bother me. Mother's just trying to protect my virtue." She smiled, trying to look as
		innocent and ladylike as possible.</p>

		<p>"Ah, I knew there had to be some explanation." Her
		curiosity satisfied she turned to her husband. "Come along now, Jon. We have others
		to attend to." Mrs. Van Doren gave Rebecca a smile that looked as if it were made of
		paste, and hooking her arm through her husbands, she propelled him off in the direction of
		a small crowd of people who had just arrived.</p>

		<p>"Sorry about that," Lance said once his parents were
		out of earshot.</p>

		<p>"Mother can be a bit...nosy at times."</p>

		<p>"It's all right," Rebecca replied. The smell of fresh
		ribs cooking assailed her nose. "Mmm, smells wonderful," she said sincerely.</p>

		<p>"Oh, you haven't lived until you taste Pedro's cooking. His
		ribs melt in your mouth," he chuckled. "Of course, you'd better make sure you
		have a tall glass of water next to you. It's a bit spicy."</p>

		<p>"I can handle spicy, Lance. One time, my father came home
		from the trading post with a small little pepper and gosh was it hot."</p>

		<p>"Well, I guess you can handle Pedro's sauce then. Come on,
		let's see if we can get some before the ranch hands take it all."</p>

		<p>"You think she's having a nice time?" Josie asked
		absentmindedly for the fifth time in the last hour.</p>

		<p>"Josie, she's fine. She'll be back anytime now, I'm sure of
		it. Just relax," Sandy said with a sigh pulling two thin cigars out of a humidor on
		the desk. "Now I think I've seen his family around here before. Don't get out much,
		ya know. They look like real nice people. I'm sure she's just fine," she said as she
		handed the cue ball to the gunslinger. "I do believe it's your shot."</p>

		<p>"Yeah," Josie replied noncommittally. To herself she
		wondered, 'are you safe, sprite? Are you all right? Please be careful.'</p>

		<p>"Did you enjoy yourself, Rebecca?" he asked as they
		walked near the stable.</p>

		<p>"Yes I did, thank you. The food was wonderful, and the
		company was nice too," she said shyly, turning her head away slightly.</p>

		<p>"Yes it was," he said, his voice slightly deeper than
		before. They were standing just outside the stable. Lance moved, positioning her between
		him and the wall of the building. "Rebecca..." he said as he moved closer,
		causing her to back up against the whitewashed wood. "You are very pretty." He
		had noticed the way she smiled earlier that night whenever he said that and he tried to
		use it to his advantage now. "Your lips, they were made for kissing." He ran his
		thumb across her lower lip, causing her heart to pick up its beat slightly. Rebecca looked
		at him uncertainly not knowing what to do or say, afraid she was about to be kissed and
		afraid that she wasn't.</p>

		<p>"Oh?" was all she could think of to say. Lance smiled.</p>

		<p>"Yeah." He bent down and pressed his lips to hers,
		pushing her harder against the wall. His arms came out to rest against the wood on either
		side of her head. "Rebecca..." he whispered as he came up for air before
		planting another firm kiss against her mouth. She felt his tongue slip past his lips,
		demanding entry.</p>

		<p>"No," she said as she pressed her hands against his
		chest, trying to back him away from her. Lance didn't back up, but he made no effort to
		continue.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca ...all girls kiss," he said as if stating the
		obvious.</p>

		<p>"I did kiss you...but I don't want to do...that," she
		said, wishing that Josie was there at that moment. "Lance, a real gentleman wouldn't
		try to push a lady further than she wanted to go."</p>

		<p>He ran his fingers through his brown hair as he tried to maintain
		control. This small blonde woman was so tempting. He longed to taste her mouth, to take
		her to his bed. She would be a good mother, he thought as he looked at the womanly flare
		of her hips. His mother always said to look at their hips; the larger they were, the
		better for bearing children. Rebecca's hips weren't that wide, but certainly looked nice
		enough to keep the flames going for quite some time. Lance smiled at her and placed his
		hand beside her head again, leaning in ever so slightly. "I'm not trying to push you,
		sweet Rebecca. I am, after all, nothing if not a gentleman." He made no effort to
		change his position just as she made no effort to remove her hands from his chest, lest he
		move forward to kiss her again. "But you need to understand that when a man kisses
		you, you have to let him kiss you the way he wants to. Have you ever been kissed like that
		before?"</p>

		<p>"N-no. Lance, I think I'd better get back now," she
		tried to duck under his arms but he was too fast for her. He quickly wrapped his arms
		around her and held her close.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca...I'm not trying to rape you, I just want a
		kiss." He brought his mouth to hers again, this time with more authority. He forced
		her mouth open with his tongue, yelping and letting go of her when he felt the bite of her
		teeth on his lower lip. "Ow...you bitch," he spat, his hand going to his tender
		lip.</p>

		<p>"I said no," she said nervously, visions of the women
		of Rosewood and the things that Lefty's men did to them filling her mind, making panic
		rise in her throat.</p>

		<p>"Well...I guess you did, didn't you?" he said in a
		defeated tone. "If that's how you want to be...." Rebecca understood the
		implication. He wasn't interested in her anymore. He looked over at the crowd of ranch
		hands milling about. "Hey Matt!" he called. One of the men separated himself
		from the crowd and began walking their way. "Matt will take you home," he said,
		effectively dismissing her as he walked to meet with the ranch hand. He said a few words
		to the man, gesturing in her direction, and without a backward glance he rejoined the
		celebration up at the main house. Matt looked apologetic as he escorted her to the wagons
		and helped her into the one the ranch hands used for hauling hay about the fields.</p>

		<p>"Sorry ma'am. This here's the only one that Mr. Van Doren
		lets us use. Seat's pretty clean, though," he pulled out his handkerchief and wiped
		the wooden seat before she sat down anyway. "I'll have you home in no time." He
		sat down and snapped the reins, sending the horse into motion. Rebecca remained quiet on
		the way back, wishing only to be back with Josie, to have her tell her that she'd done
		nothing wrong, and that everything would be all right, but mostly just to be with her.</p>

		<p>Josie paced back and forth from the window to the door of the
		back room.</p>

		<p>Sandy looked at the clock nervously. It was after ten and there
		was no sign of Rebecca. A half dozen whores sat around playing cards. The menacing look of
		the gunslinger had driven away most of the evening's business since she had come out of
		the back room shortly after eight and began her relentless pacing. "Josie, please
		come sit down...you're making me dizzy."</p>

		<p>"How much longer can she possibly be? She said she'd be back
		early," the gunslinger growled. The creak of a wagon in the distance drew her back to
		the window. "She's back," Josie said with relief evident in her voice, and she
		headed for the door.</p>

		<p>"Good night," Sandy said to the retreating form.</p>

		<p>Josie made it back to the boarding house a minute or two before
		Rebecca. She had the lamp turned up and was sitting in the chair, waiting for the young
		woman to come upstairs and tell her about her evening. She listened to the rhythm of the
		young woman's steps in the hall. They stopped at the door, but Rebecca didn't enter
		immediately. Seconds passed as Josie waited for the blonde to open the door. A grave fear
		set in as the gunslinger leapt from her chair and opened the door. Instantly Rebecca was
		in her arms, sobbing shamelessly. Josie's body softened immediately as she enveloped the
		young woman in her arms and closed the door. She led them to the bed and sat down, keeping
		her arms around Rebecca. Anger, fear, concern, and a twinge of guilt for not being there
		all filled the gunslinger as she waited for the tears and ragged breathing to cease and
		her friend to be able to speak again.</p>

		<p>It was several minutes before Rebecca calmed down enough to
		speak. Josie had spent the time holding her, doing her best to keep her anger in check and
		promising herself that Lance would suffer if he hurt her friend in any way. Slowly the
		tears and haggard breathing eased to a point where Josie felt comfortable letting go.
		"What happened?", the gunslinger asked tentatively, not fully certain she wanted
		to know the answer. Her eyes inspected Rebecca, noting no tears in the dress, nor bruising
		anywhere, except perhaps her lips. The young woman took a shaky breath before speaking,
		her eyes fixed upon a spot on the floor.</p>

		<p>"He kissed me," she said softly. "I wanted him to,
		but..." her voice trailed off. Josie placed her fingers on the young woman's chin and
		forced her to meet her gaze.</p>

		<p>"But what, Rebecca? What did he do?" She fought to keep
		her anger in check and not let it show in her voice. "Tell me," she said softly.</p>

		<p>"He tried..." she paused but didn't turn away. Josie
		swore she could see the young woman gathering the strength to speak. "He tried to
		kiss me more than I wanted...and when I said no, he...he got mad and had one of the men
		drive me home."</p>

		<p>"He wasn't man enough to escort you home?" This time
		Josie made no effort to hide her anger, only the intensity of it.</p>

		<p>"But he had Matt bring me...he's a nice fellow." She
		saw no change in the gunslinger's expression. "Josie, he didn't try anything. Matt
		was a perfect gentleman."</p>

		<p>"Shame Lance wasn't," she growled, rising and going to
		the window. It was taking great effort to stay in the room and not go knock some sense
		into the young man, or just knock him around. A very unpleasant thought came to her.
		"Rebecca ...is there anything else? I mean did he try to touch you?" It was an
		effort to get the words out.</p>

		<p>"No," was the soft reply. Josie visibly relaxed and
		returned to the bed. Without thought, she put her arm around Rebecca's shoulders and
		pulled her in for another hug.</p>

		<p>"It's all right now, sprite. You're safe here," she
		whispered into the younger woman's ear. "I wish it had gone better."</p>

		<p>"I had a nice time otherwise," Rebecca offered, trying
		to lighten the mood. "They have a cook, Pedro. He makes the best barbecue ribs...
		they were so good."</p>

		<p>"How many racks did you eat, my little eating
		machine?", the gunslinger teased good-naturedly, also trying to eradicate the somber
		mood. The young woman smiled and wiped her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I only had a few pieces. Had to act like a lady, after all.
		</p>

		<p>Oh, they had a small band there, too..." She went on for
		several minutes describing the rest of the party, deliberately leaving out her
		conversation with Lance's mother. She let out a long yawn in the middle of describing the
		ranch itself.</p>

		<p>"I think it's time for bed," Josie said as she rose to
		her feet.</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded and reached down to unbutton her boots. Without a
		word, the gunslinger dropped to the floor and made quick work of the buttons.</p>

		<p>"Thanks." She picked one of the boots up and stared at
		it thoughtfully. "You know, Josie, someday I'm going to give you something. Something
		that only I can give you. Something irreplaceable." She gingerly ran her fingers over
		the leather of the boot. "Something that makes you feel as special as I do tonight.
		You didn't have to get me these beautiful boots, you didn't have to find me the
		dress." Before Josie could react, Rebecca put her arms around her and gave her a
		loving embrace. "Someday...."</p>

		<p>Josie looked down at the blonde head resting under her chin. She
		thought back over the last few months, trying to pinpoint exactly when the young woman in
		her arms slipped past her defenses and became such an important part of her life, not just
		an unexpected burden. She tightened her grip slightly, smiling to herself when she felt it
		returned. "Come on, sprite. You've had a long day. Let's get you to bed."</p>

		<p>Long after Rebecca had fallen under the sandman's spell, Josie
		laid awake trying to quell the anger that burned inside her. Despite the young woman's
		protests that he did nothing other than try to kiss her more than she wanted to, the
		gunslinger still felt an almost uncontrollable rage towards him. How dare he try to force
		his way on Rebecca. Only when she looked at the angelic face sleeping beside her did Josie
		feel any sense of calm. Moving gently as so not to disturb her, the gunslinger curled her
		body around Rebecca's and soon joined her in sleep.</p>

		<p>After breakfast, they went to the saloon to return the dress and
		to visit with their friends. Sandy adamantly refused to accept the garment, citing that it
		had been collecting dust in the closet for months after its original owner left. She gave
		Rebecca a small carpetbag to keep the dress in while they traveled. Josie sat at a table
		with three other women, intent on playing a few hands of poker while the young blonde went
		upstairs to visit with Stacey and Victoria, both of whom had remained in their rooms.</p>

		<p>"Full house," Elaine said triumphantly as she lay her
		cards down and reached for the pot. Despite having a flush in her hand, Josie tossed her
		cards down. Something else had captured her interest.</p>

		<p>"I'll be back," she said firmly as she rose from her
		chair and stormed out the door. Elaine and the others looked at each other for just a
		brief moment before the black headed woman went in search of Sandy. She had no idea who or
		what the tall woman had seen, but whatever it was, the gunslinger was most definitely
		angry when she left.</p>

		<p>Lance stepped down from the wooden walk in front of the
		mercantile, totally oblivious to his surroundings. The next thing he knew, he was being
		thrown hard against the side of the building, an extremely angry woman in black glaring at
		him, her hands clenching the front of his shirt. There was a fire in the ice blue eyes, a
		fire that was reserved for him and he knew it. Never in his young life had he felt so much
		fear as he did at that very moment. "I-I-I...." he stammered helplessly.</p>

		<p>"You are a very lucky man, you know that?" Josie
		growled, pushing him against the wall again for emphasis. "I don't like men who try
		to take advantage of young women, especially...my...friend." She accentuated the last
		three words with little shoves into his chest, each shove slamming him hard against the
		wood.</p>

		<p>"I-I...all I did was kiss her," he cried, his eyes
		darting around in a vain attempt to find someone to help him. "I swear I didn't try
		anything else, I swear!"</p>

		<p>"If you had tried something else..." Josie moved close,
		her face scant inches away from his. "...the only 'lance' you would have left is the
		one in your signature." She looked down at his crotch, then back up at his face, and
		arched an eyebrow. "Got it?"</p>

		<p>He swallowed nervously as beads of nervous perspiration rolled
		off his brow. Josie pulled him forward slightly and shoved him against the wall again,
		slightly harder than before. She knew he would end up with little more than a few bruises
		on his shoulder blades and perhaps a ruined pair of britches, but in her eyes, that was a
		small price to pay for making Rebecca's first date an unpleasant experience. "Rebecca
		is a very forgiving person, but I'm not. Be thankful that you get to walk away with all
		your body parts intact." She gave him one more shove and then let go of his shirt.
		"Hurt her again and I swear you won't live to regret it."</p>

		<p>Lance slumped down on the ground next to the wall, grateful to be
		alive. Josie gave him one more menacing stare before turning to head back to the saloon.
		She stopped short when she saw Rebecca standing at the mouth of the alleyway staring at
		her. Neither paid any attention as the scared young man quickly took his leave, smartly
		heading in the opposite direction. Josie approached her, trying to keep her face as
		expressionless as possible despite the gnawing fear that the young woman would think her
		little more than an animal for attacking him. By the time the gunslinger was within
		touching distance of Rebecca, she was certain that the young woman would walk away from
		her, never to return.</p>

		<p>"How much did you see?" Josie asked, managing to avoid
		eye contact, certain of the disappointment she would find there. She was startled to feel
		a gentle touch on her forearm as Rebecca reached out to her.</p>

		<p>"Enough," she said softly. "Did you hurt
		him?"</p>

		<p>"Not nearly as much as I wanted to," the gunslinger
		admitted. "I held back."</p>

		<p>"Why? Hey..." she put her fingers on Josie's cheek.
		"...look at me...that's better. Why did you hold back? Because of me?" she asked
		gently. The blue eyes flickered for the briefest of moments, giving Rebecca her answer.
		The unspoken admission was enough to make Josie visibly uncomfortable. The young woman
		pulled her hand back and smiled warmly, as she understood the unspoken fear. She also
		understood that her tall companion wasn't ready to voice that fear or have it voiced for
		her. This wasn't a case of the gunslinger protecting someone from harm. Rebecca realized
		that it went much deeper than that. What happened in the alleyway was revenge, pure and
		simple. Josie wanted to punish Lance for hurting her. As much as the thought of physical
		violence bothered her, Rebecca nevertheless felt a warm, comfortable feeling at the
		knowledge that the gunslinger cared enough about her to do such a thing. She captured the
		blue eyes with her own. "I'm glad you didn't beat the stuffing out of him, even if he
		did deserve it."</p>

		<p>The words eased the tightness that Josie was feeling in her
		chest, as she understood that Rebecca wasn't upset with her. "I wanted to, you know.
		I wanted to push his little head right through the wall." Her muscled forearms tensed
		as she remembered the feeling of slamming him against the wooden side of the building.</p>

		<p>"I know you did, Josie. But don't you see? You didn't. You
		didn't hurt him; well not badly anyway, and you didn't lose control," she said
		reassuringly, frowning when she noticed that the gunslinger's jaw was still clenched as
		tightly as her fists. "Josie, you're not the monster people think you are or even you
		think you are. What you did today wasn't done out of anger or hatred, it was done out of
		care and concern for another human being." She touched the gunslinger's arm again and
		maintained the contact, wrapping her small fingers around the powerful wrist. "For
		me," Rebecca said softly, almost in awe that her sadness could affect Josie so.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger cleared her throat and politely pulled her arm
		back, the emotions becoming too much for her once again. "I don't think you have to
		worry about old lance in the pants again."</p>

		<p>"Josie!" Rebecca said, shocked at her friend's comment.
		"I don't believe you said that. How awful." A huge grin broke out on her face as
		she thought about the comment some more. The grin turned into a smile, which in turn
		became a giggle. She swatted her tall friend's arm playfully. "You are bad."</p>

		<p>"Stick around me and you'll learn just how bad I can
		be," Josie said wickedly. "Come on, I'll buy you a drink. If you're a good girl
		I'll even teach you how to play pool."</p>

		<p>"Really?" Rebecca said excitedly. "You would,
		really? Teach me, I mean."</p>

		<p>Josie smiled at the childish look of excitement in her friend's
		face. "Rebecca, I'll teach you how to play pool and anything else you want. I warn
		you though, I'm a hard taskmaster; worse than Belle."</p>

		<p>"If you're my teacher, I don't think I'll mind. I'm a fast
		learner, you'll see," she said enthusiastically. "I won't let you down."</p>

		<p>"I'm sure you won't," Josie agreed as they entered the
		saloon.</p>
