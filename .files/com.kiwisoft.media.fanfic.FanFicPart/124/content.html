<!-- Prophecy of Love \ Story -->

<p>As had been the norm for Giles of late, he was sitting on his couch drinking a glass of scotch. The life of a bachelor just didn't suit him anymore. He couldn't help Buffy, and getting a job at Sunnydale's less than impressive museum was not an option he was considering.</p>
<p>The librarian job was simply a cover. He was versed in everything from history to art, but his main love was demon lore and the occult. And that wasn't something you taught. Not in Sunnydale anyhow.</p>
<p>There would be a good chance that someone would try to do a ritual and bring forth some demon that Buffy would have to risk her life to defeat. No, that was a bad idea. But still liking to reflect back on his Watcher days, he picked up an old volume, and dusted off the cover.</p>
<p>The Codex? He remembered when Angel gave him this. It revealed the prophecy of Buffy's death at the hands the Master, and it had come true. They hadn't had to deal with prophecies for a long time. He figured that when Spike and Druscilla had come, and ever since, the forces responsible for carrying out the prophecies had simply called it quits.</p>
<p>He leafed through it anyway, and stopped near the end of the volume. Translating the text slowly, he began to read the random page he had ended up on.</p>
<p>&#34; 'If Fate is merciful, and the Slayer continues to live after her battle with the Old One, she shall continue to live until..akes.ldest in history, she.ill.perish.' Dear God.</p>
<p>&#34; 'She must..find.to survive.' Find what?&#34;</p>
<p>He turned the page, and read the rather, not surprisingly, cryptic explanation:</p>
<p>A symbol of love will bring about two halves made whole Two apart become one, under protest Only true feelings will bring them together Falsehood renders one weak; destroys the other. Signs point to the way, but none wish to see them for what they mean.<p>He set the book down, and reached for his phone. Dialing a number, he waited three rings, and someone answered.</p>
<p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Willow, it's me. I need you here. I'll explain when you arrive.&#34;</p>
<p>Hanging up, he dialed one more number.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Angel, we have a problem.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Willow glanced at the phone. She knew that whenever Giles said, 'I'll explain...', nothing good would come of it.</p>
<p>Something was wrong; lives were in peril, most likely Buffy's. She sighed heavily as she placed the phone on the hook, grabbing her backpack and headed for the door.</p>
<p>She stopped and went to her desk and wrote a quick note letting Buffy know where she was going and left for Giles' apartment.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;There's gotta be something else.&#34; Willow said, re-reading the passages for what seemed like the thirtieth time.</p>
<p>&#34;As much as I wish there were,&#34; Giles cleared his throat, &#34;prophecies are known for their vague details.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why now? Why, period?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not entirely sure, however, Buffy is the oldest Slayer in recorded history. Her life span might be already set. To allow the next Slayer-in-waiting to replace her.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And again, why? Since she is the oldest Slayer, doesn't that mean she's the best slayer? Why would, whoever, want to get rid of her?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I wish I knew. Even if we were still in contact with the Council, I doubt they would be of much help.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay, so let's try to make sense of what's here. This all has to do with love? How would we know if she hasn't already found.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We wouldn't, I suppose. Has she said anything to you lately? Has she had any pains? Or.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She has seemed a little more tired lately. Actually so have I.&#34; &#34;Could you be more specific?&#34; &#34;Well.she comes back from patrol exhausted. Worn down, she usually goes right to bed. Sometimes we both don't feel like moving at all. We haven't been to the Bronze.&#34;<p>&#34;That could be stress from classes or overexertion or any number of things.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, but she's been fine. She's getting great grades, better then me sometimes, and she's been doing the same training and patrolling routine you gave her at the end of the summer. You know how she is. She avoids extra work.&#34;</p>
<p>Giles grinned slightly, and turned serious once again. &#34;Then this prophecy is worth our time. We just have to determine where to start.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;So.she hasn't found her true love yet?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I suppose not. And that's a hard thing to find. For anyone.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then I guess that rules me out.&#34; Angel said, making his presence known. They turned around, surprised.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes, well, you.ah.haven't lost your touch.&#34; Giles said trying to regain his composure.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They had lost track of time as the three of them went into full-on research. Willow walked up to Angel. He didn't seem to show any reaction when they had figured out that he wasn't the one Buffy was meant to be with, and that worried her.</p>
<p>&#34;She still loves you, you know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know. And I feel the same way. But I had figured out awhile ago that as much as we wanted to be, we weren't meant to be together. For more than the obvious reasons.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Really? How?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Simple. Willow, if you find your true love, fate doesn't keep you away from them; it helps you find them. If someone never finds their true love, it's their own fault. Either they chose to let that person pass them by, or they weren't looking hard enough.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And I guess Fate has done everything it could to keep you and Buffy apart, huh?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;So I'm not the one.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Do you think -?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Whoever it was for me, that person was taken away. They don't give demons true loves. She probably died at my hands.&#34;</p>
<p>There was so much pain in his voice. &#34;How do you know Buffy hasn't missed that person?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She's still young. That person's out there, it's just up to her to realize that and find them. Before it's too late.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't understand.&#34; Giles said from across the room. &#34;I know I've been out of practice, but I just don't see the connection.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Other than the poetic one? Something's that goes like, 'Without love, what reason is there to live?'&#34; Willow offered.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If you read further back in the Codex,&#34; Angel said, &#34;there's references to things a Slayer must achieve. And maintain.&#34;</p>
<p>Giles skimmed further back. &#34;Lasting contacts?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;A cold term for friendships.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She's got those. I can vouch for that.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;Keys necessary to survival and the ability to adapt.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Creativity, skills and strength.&#34; Angel said.</p>
<p>&#34;And it looks like, family, is the next one.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay, so she's got all of that, and love is the last one.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;But all that is simply what every person has, or hopes to have.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Only the stakes are higher for Buffy. She has to work to keep those things, or her life is taken away. It's a test.&#34; Angel stated.</p>
<p>&#34;So since Buffy's the Slayer, in order for her to keep her life, she has to earn one?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;That makes sense. The odds are already against a Slayer, but if she can overcome them, and come out on top with those four essentials to life that we sometimes take for granted, she's rewarded with.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Life.&#34; Angel said.</p>
<p>&#34;She's three for four. Who's her -&#34; Willow started.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Buffy walked in. &#34;So.what's going on in here?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p><p> Giles took off his glasses and wiped them. He hadn't anticipated Buffy's arrival. &#34;Ah... well... yes, hello, Buffy. We are... that is to say,&#34; he stuttered. &#34;Angel...&#34; &#34;Buffy,&#34; he replied, sticking his hands in his coat pockets. &#34;You got my note?&#34; Willow said hoping to distract Buffy somehow.<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy replied, turning towards her dorm mate. &#34;I thought I'd swing by... see what's going on,&#34; she said, her gaze settling on Angel once more.</p>
<p>She had been shocked when she walked into Giles' apartment and saw him there. So much had passed between them ever since graduation and her trip to Los Angeles earlier. She had honestly thought she would never see him again, never feel the pain lancing through her heart at what she couldn't have.</p>
<p>&#34;Ah... nothing, really. Angel was just dropping off a book I needed,&#34; Giles said, hoping Angel would take the hint.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah... I hope you find what you're looking for. Willow... always nice to see you,&#34; Angel said before turning to the woman who had so captured his heart. &#34;Buffy...&#34; he shrugged, knowing there were no words to lessen the pain of leaving once again.</p>
<p>&#34;You're leaving?&#34; Buffy asked, taking a step towards him, the slightest glimmer of hope fading in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;Things to do. Giles, let me know if you need anything... book wise,&#34; Angel told him. &#34;Yes... yes, of course. And thank you,&#34; he replied.<p>He knew Buffy would be hurt by Angel's sudden departure, and he wished there were something he could do for his surrogate daughter.</p>
<p>&#34;Bye Angel,&#34; Willow said, watching Buffy, seeing the pain etched on her face. 'Why can't she be happy?' she asked herself.</p>
<p>Angel left, leaving the room in a somber mood. <br></p>
 No one said a word.<hr width=100>
<p>The awkward silence continued for a few moments, before Buffy crossed her arms over her chest, and in what seemed to Willow and Giles to be a miraculous feat, eyed them both carefully. When she got that look, it meant danger.</p>
<p>&#34;So, spill.&#34; She focused on Willow. &#34;And as entertaining as I find your babbling, you better be honest.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Giles?&#34; Willow asked, leaving the explanation up to him.</p>
<p>He shot her a quick look, and started. &#34;You see.I was.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Wait. Let me see if I can figure this out. Kinda feels like déjà vu.&#34; She walked over to the couch, and closed the open book laying on it. &#34;The Codex, huh? I have some not so fond memories of this thing.</p>
<p>&#34;So, you and Angel and the Codex. It's a little different than last time, though. Willow's in on it now. And whatever's in this book must be really important or else Angel wouldn't have driven all the way from LA. Am I getting warmer? Am I on the right track?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy.we just wanted to find.&#34; Willow tried to say.</p>
<p>&#34;No, you wanted to let me in on this big 'whatever' at the last possible second. Why am I, especially because this directly affects me, always the last to know? It's another 'I'm gonna die' prophecy, right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He said softly. &#34;Although not all prophecies in the Codex revolve around the death of -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No, the majority of them just help me get closer to my death. Well, I beat it once. I can do it again. What is it this time? The Master's father's uncle's second aunt who married his cousin who likes his sister and wants to kill me through special vamp powers only gained through inbreeding?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Never mind.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It has to do with love, Buffy. Unless you find your true love, you.you.&#34; Willow couldn't bring herself to finish.</p>
<p>&#34;I die? Well he just walked out the door.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Angel's not it.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;How do you know?&#34;</p>
<p>He simply looked at her, his eyes asking her to simply trust him. Angel wasn't the one. Expecting to heartbroken, Buffy was surprised when she wasn't. She almost felt relieved. Now, she knew that there was somebody out there for her. Someone she could love without consequences. She didn't have to keep pining for him. There was someone else who would understand.</p>
<p>Her heart was breaking for him, though. Angel didn't deserve any of the pain thrown his way. He must have been crushed when he heard the news.</p>
<p>&#34;Who is it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Only you would know that.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;But I don't!&#34; Buffy's anger quickly turned into panic. &#34;If I don't find.I could.I can't fight my way out of this.I.&#34;</p>
<p>This was turning out like that same night all right. Giles just hoped it wouldn't end with him being knocked unconscious this time.</p>
<p>&#34;It'll be okay, Buffy.&#34; Willow said reassuringly.</p>
<p>&#34;What if it isn't? What if.&#34; Before she could finish, she started to feel lightheaded, and she collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Giles and Willow were immediately at her side.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Giles!&#34; Willow cried out as they reached Buffy; her face frighteningly pale.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow, get the first-aid kit from...&#34; he never completed his instructions as she bolted from the living room.</p>
<p>He gathered Buffy into his arms carefully. 'Please, let her find her true love,' he prayed silently as he placed her on the couch.</p>
<p>&#34;Here it is,&#34; Willow said slightly out of breath.</p>
<p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; he replied, taking the kit from her trembling hand. &#34;Willow, why don't you get some water... for Buffy,&#34;</p>
<p>She nodded and went to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Opening up the first-aid kit, Giles took out the ammonia capsule, breaking it in half, and turning his head slightly as his eyes began to water, and held it under Buffy's nose. Buffy turned her head trying to avoid the smell, but no matter where she turned, the odor followed.</p>
<p>&#34;Buff... Buffy, wake up,&#34; Giles urged. <br></p>
 &#34;Giles...?&#34; Willow asked, bearing the glass of water. He shook his head. &#34;Buffy... come on... wake up,&#34; Giles said<p>The blonde haired slayer began to cough, her hands deflecting the smell; slowly she opened her eyes. &#34;Gi... Giles? Will... what happened?&#34; she asked, blinking away the tears.</p>
<p>&#34;You fainted,&#34; Giles said, placing the capsule on top of the kit. &#34;Do you think you can sit up?&#34; he asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I think so... &#34; She replied, grabbing his hand. &#34;WHOA! The room's spinning.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You'll be fine in a moment,&#34; Giles said, before taking the glass of water from Willow. &#34;Here, drink this.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow walked around the couch and sat down next to Buffy carefully.</p>
<p>&#34;How do you feel?&#34; she asked concerned for her friend's welfare.</p>
<p>Buffy vividly remembered the flash of images that hit her while she was out. Most of them were of her own death. Very disturbing. She didn't think it was foretelling the ending of the prophecy, it was more like her imagination. Other images kept popping up. Faces.</p>
<p>'Or was it one face?' She couldn't remember.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy? Are you okay?&#34; Willow asked, even more concerned now because Buffy had yet to answer her.</p>
<p>&#34;For someone who's gonna die.can't complain.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow's eyes suddenly became very focused, and then extremely sad. She started to cry. Feeling like the lowest person on earth, Buffy pulled Willow to her, and she continued to cry on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#34;God, Will.I'm sorry. You know, how I get. Miss inappropriate humor.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't want you to die, Buffy.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't want me to die either.&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
 Buffy looked to Giles for any kind of support.<p>&#34;I don't know where to begin. It could be any number of people. Someone you may have met, someone you know well.I wouldn't think you'd have to go far to find whoever it is, but then again, this is all rather unpredictable.&#34; &#34;What about Xander?&#34; Willow asked, sniffling.<p>&#34;What about him.oh no.&#34; Buffy said, paling.</p>
<p>&#34;That might fit. The prophecy says something about being 'under protest', and you have warded off his attempts to -&#34; Giles started.</p>
<p>&#34;He's not it. He's a friend, that I value highly, don't get me wrong, but he's not.not in that way.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How can you be sure?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Gut instinct. Besides if he were my true love, I doubt I would've turned him down, and I just don't get 'the feeling.'&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We just keep looking then.&#34; Willow said, more than a little relieved that Xander wasn't it.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes, but no more tonight. We all need rest. The two of you especially.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Buffy said, getting up and moving towards the door.</p>
<p>They were shocked. Buffy had never been quick to listen, but she had just given in. She walked out, and Giles walked over to Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Watch her.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Later, in the dorm room, Buffy and Willow were both sitting on their beds. As much as they wanted to, they couldn't go to sleep. Mainly, it was because they both were afraid of what would happen if they did.</p>
<p>&#34;Riley?&#34; Willow asked. She was still trying to figure out who it was.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't think so, although he does make me swoony. But Parker did that too, so.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And if he was it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I wouldn't be fainting, and worn out, because I'm not under protest with him. We do stuff. I'm not fighting his attempts.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That crosses another name off the list.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I feel so bad now. Riley's a great guy, but if he's not it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He'll find someone.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah.I guess you're right.&#34; Buffy sighed then yawned, and despite her desire to stay up, she was exhausted and out like a light within seconds.</p>
<p>Willow wanted to stay up to watch over her friend, but sleep was beckoning, and she had to give in.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to a woman taken from us at the very beginning of her life,&#34; Willow heard in the background.</p>
<p>Her mind and body were numb.</p>
<p>She let her eyes drift around. There were so many people; some that she hadn't seen since high school. She had never seen a turnout this large before.</p>
<p>She saw Giles, his face, was... hard. She couldn't see 'him' anymore. It wasn't the kind, gentleman she had known for so long. He had been replaced, and she didn't like it. She could see a slight tremor run along the side of his jaw. His eyes seemed cold and distant when he turned to her briefly, and she suppressed a shudder.</p>
<p>Her eyes drifted again. 'Oh, Xander,' she thought.</p>
<p>His pain was clearly written on his face, tears streaming down his cheeks. Anya was by his side, patting his arm awkwardly. She thought it was strange that he wasn't with the rest of them, but rather standing on the opposite side.</p>
<p>There he was, she had found him. Xander was almost hidden, way in the back, next to an oak tree. He stood there holding a single red rose. Willow noticed Cordelia making her way towards him.</p>
<p>Cordelia stopped short, when she saw Anya looking in her way with daggers in her eyes. Cordelia, showing a new restraint, calmly took her place and stood at Xander's left side, taking his hand in hers and squeezing it gently, in what could be said to be a show of support.</p>
<p>Xander turned to Cordelia and gave her a brief smile.</p>
<p>Willow felt the presence of someone's hand in hers.</p>
<p>'It's okay Willow... I understand,' she heard in her head.</p>
<p>She turned in the direction of the voice only to see Buffy's mother, Joyce, sitting, staring straight ahead, her hands firmly in her lap.</p>
<p>She heard the voice again.</p>
<p>'I don't blame you Will...believe me I don't. It's not your fault.'</p>
<p>&#34;It's...it's time,&#34; Willow heard Buffy's mother say out loud.</p>
<p>Joyce Summers, walking to her daughter's grave, grabbed a handful of dirt and let it slide from her hands onto the casket. Giles led Joyce back to her seat when it seemed she was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Willow held back...letting others go ahead of her and allowing them to pay their last respects. Just as she was about to step towards the mound of dirt, she felt a pair of hands on her shoulder, spinning her around.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander?&#34; she asked, stunned by the look on his face, she could never recall seeing such an intense look of...disgust before.</p>
<p>Willow could see from the corner of her eye Giles making his way towards them.</p>
<p>SLAP!</p>
<p>Her head jerked to the right, then back again.</p>
<p>Xander had hit her.</p>
<p>He had slapped her.</p>
<p>Never in all the years they had been friends, had they ever raised a hand against each other. Giles stepped in and pushed Xander away from her.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander...stop this nonsense at once,&#34; Giles told him, his voice deadly.</p>
<p>&#34;How...how can you...? It's HER fault,&#34; he said accusingly, pointing a finger in her direction.</p>
<p>'I'm not going to cry...I'm not going to cry,' Willow kept telling herself</p>
<p>&#34;Why didn't you save her...why couldn't you.? I hate you...I never want to see you...'ever' again,&#34; Xander told her before turning around and leaving, Anya and Cordelia looking at Willow, then following him as he left.</p>
<p>They had been stunned by his actions, and knew the best thing to do was to let him deal with it.</p>
<p>&#34;Gi...Giles?&#34; Willow said, turning to her mentor. She was in shock and wasn't sure how to handle the situation.</p>
<p>&#34;Give him time Willow...he'll come around,&#34; he said. &#34;I know this may sound uncaring, but I have to go.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You can't leave...not now!&#34; she pleaded with him.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow...there's...there's nothing left for me now. Surely you must realize that I can never redeem myself, not here,&#34; he said gesturing towards the gravesite. &#34;I...I failed her...when she needed me most, I failed her...I failed you both.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Please...&#34; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm...I'm sorry. Goodbye,&#34; he told her, Willow watched as he left, her world being torn apart.</p>
<p>&#34;Do...do you hate me too?&#34; she asked, when Angel finally placed his rose on the headstone.</p>
<p>&#34;I...I don't hate you Willow. You're young,&#34; he told her.</p>
<p>&#34;What's that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's for you to find out. There are no easy answers in life; we take the cards dealt to us by life...fate, or what have you, and hope we have a winning hand. Sometimes we do...other times,&#34; he drifted off as he looked at hole in the ground that seemed like an open wound, which, no matter how much time passed, would never heal.</p>
<p>&#34;'Signs point to the way, but none wish to see them for what they mean'.&#34; he whispered before turning his attention back to her. &#34;If you need anything...you know where to find me. And don't worry about Harris, he'll come around begging your forgiveness. Take care, Willow.&#34;</p>
<p>Everyone had left, and she was alone. Utterly alone. She heard a noise behind her and turned around. The men that worked in the cemetery were beginning to fill in the hole.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; she whispered, shaking her head. &#34;NO...STOP!&#34; she yelled, as the two men paid no attention to her and continued to cover the casket with dirt. &#34;NO...STOP IT!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Will.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;SHE'S NOT DEAD!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Will...wake up.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy had been awoken by the sound of Willow's voice, and had gone to her friend's bed, hoping to put an end to the nightmare Willow was obviously having.</p>
<p>&#34;IT'S MY FAULT!&#34; Willow cried out.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow...wake up...it's not your fault,&#34; Buffy said, unknowingly echoing the words from Willow's dream.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; Willow asked, her eyes wide open, yet disoriented.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm here Will,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>
<p>&#34;You're alive?&#34; she asked timidly, wondering if she was still dreaming.</p>
<p>&#34;As far as I can tell,&#34; Buffy quipped.</p>
<p>&#34;You're alive...you're alive,&#34; Willow repeated as she crushed Buffy in a hurried embrace, nearly knocking them off her bed.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm alive, Will...I'm alive,&#34; Buffy said, rocking them slowly, letting her right hand rub her friend's back in a soothing motion.</p>
<p>'She's alive...she's alive', Willow kept telling herself, placing her ear on Buffy's chest, listening to the heartbeat resounding in her ear.</p>
<p>&#34;It was just a dream Will...just a dream,&#34; Buffy whispered. She could feel Willow nod her head, the grip Willow had on her still tight, as if her friend needed to hold on, to be sure that the words she heard were the truth. &#34;I'm not going anywhere, I won't leave you,&#34; she said.</p>
<p>&#34;You won't?&#34; she heard muffled by her chest.</p>
<p>&#34;No, I won't.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Promise?&#34; <br></p>
 There was a brief pause before Buffy answered. <p>&#34;I wish I could Will, I wish I could. But...right now, I'm not going anywhere,&#34; she said, bending down and kissing her friend on the top of her head.</p>
<p>They stayed together until Buffy was sure that Willow had fallen asleep, then she gently eased herself from the warm cocoon that was simply Willow, and went back to her own bed and thought about what had just happened.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy found herself in the halls of Sunnydale High. Wandering. Was the person here? Had they died during the Ascension?</p>
<p>Before she knew what was happening, millions of people were flying past her. Almost in a blur. She tried to look at their faces, pulling people out randomly. None of them were the one.</p>
<p>&#34;Please be here!&#34; She was becoming frantic.</p>
<p>The library. Giles. The gang. They would help her. She ran through the crowd, and through the library doors. Xander was sitting at the table calmly, and she could hear Giles up in the stacks. Willow wasn't there.</p>
<p>&#34;Find her yet?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Find who?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You better hurry.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Do you know who the person is?&#34; He nodded. &#34;Tell me!&#34;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#34;If you don't know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How? How am I supposed to know?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Signs point the way.&#34; Giles said from upstairs.</p>
<p>&#34;But you don't want to see them for what they mean.&#34; Xander finished.</p>
<p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
<p>She remembered Willow was missing. Where would she go? Computer lab. She rushed there and entered the room. Willow was sitting at one of the computers, staring at the monitor.</p>
<p>&#34;Will, you have to help me.&#34; She walked back to where Willow was, only to find her gone.</p>
<p>Willow had moved to another computer. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know why.&#34; Buffy moved over to her again.</p>
<p>Willow had moved.again. &#34;Then I can't help you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I just know that you do. Please. I don't want to die.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't want you to either.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy tried running this time, but Willow was gone once more. &#34;Then help me!&#34;</p>
<p>Willow shook her head. &#34;I can't open your eyes for you, you have to see.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Will, what is that.supposed to.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow got up, and started walking out of the room. Buffy's chest started to hurt, and she was having trouble breathing. She tried to stumble after her friend. &#34;Where are you going? Come back! I need you!&#34;</p>
<p>She reached out her arm in a last ditch effort to stop Willow, but she was gone, and everything went black.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Willow awoke to the sound of Buffy moaning, Painfully. She got out of her bed, and walked over to Buffy's.</p>
<p>&#34;Will.need you.don't.help.&#34; Buffy was delirious.</p>
<p>Feeling her forehead, and finding it to be burning up, Willow panicked. &#34;I'm right here, Buffy. I don't know what's wrong, but you've gotta come out of it okay?&#34;</p>
<p>Getting no response, Willow started to pick up the phone. Buffy's eyes shot open then, pure terror in them.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow!&#34;</p>
<p>Willow was immediately at her side. &#34;Here I am. Here. Here.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You wouldn't.I couldn't reach you.&#34;</p>
<p>She put her hand on Buffy's face, wiping away the sweat. &#34;Feel that?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'd never not let you reach me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't want to die.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You won't. Not if I have anything to say about it. Prophecies be damned.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy, exhausted, cracked a smile. &#34;This is not a great night, is it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No.maybe we should call Giles.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What's he gonna do?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I dunno. I do know that I don't want to go back to sleep.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ditto. Can you stay with me.for awhile?&#34;</p>
<p>Willow smiled. &#34;Funny. I was just about to ask you the same thing.&#34;</p>
<p>Scooting in bed beside her, Willow's thoughts were consumed by the night's events so far. Two dreams, no.nightmares. And they both had to do with Buffy's death. And them. How much time was left?</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy and Willow talked about everything and anything except the dreams. Before they knew it, they were captured by sleep once more.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, Will?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Are we dreaming?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think so,&#34; Buffy replied, looking at the landscape. &#34;I don't think we're in Sunnydale anymore,&#34; she remarked, reaching out for Willow's hand.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Two hands clasped tightly in a dorm room.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Why...how can we be having the same dream?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't know...we'll have to ask Giles later. Hey, look...there's a house,&#34; Buffy said turning to Willow. &#34;Maybe...someone's home?&#34;</p>
<p>They walked towards the small house.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you hear that?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Sounds like a baby.&#34;</p>
<p>They were at the front door; the cries of the child were getting louder.</p>
<p>&#34;Hello?&#34; Willow called out, knocking on the door.</p>
<p>&#34;Anyone home?&#34; Buffy asked, grabbing the doorknob and turning it.</p>
<p>They looked at each other and the door slowly swung open.</p>
<p>&#34;Should we go in?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not picking anything up, but that doesn't mean much,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>
<p>&#34;So, I take that to mean yes?&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy smiled and nodded. &#34;But be careful.&#34;</p>
<p>Stepping into the house, Willow was overcome with the sensation that she had been here before. &#34;Wait...&#34; she said, walking to a desk in the hallway.</p>
<p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Looking for a baby rattle?&#34; Willow responded questioningly. She reached the desk and slowly pulled the top drawer open, and stopping halfway, she took out a bright yellow and blue baby rattle.</p>
<p>&#34;How did you know it would be there?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I didn't...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Mama.&#34; They looked at each other when they heard the baby's voice.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't look at me, you're the one with the rattle,&#34; Buffy told Willow.</p>
<p>They walked further into the hallway, and went into what had to be the living room, and there centered in the middle of the large room was a playpen.</p>
<p>&#34;MAMA!&#34; the child squealed in delight.</p>
<p>&#34;Go on Will,&#34; Buffy said, nudging her friend towards the child.</p>
<p>&#34;Um...hi. What's your name?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Come on Will, it's a kid for crying out loud,&#34; Buffy remarked as she looked around the vast room and finding it oddly to her liking.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama!&#34; the child cried out, bouncing slightly.</p>
<p>&#34;Must...must be the rattle,&#34; Willow said, handing the child the object in question.</p>
<p>The child, who looked to be around two years old, took the rattle, shook it once and dropped it on the playpen floor. Buffy looked on, as the child reached out for Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The kid thinks you're...hey, is it a boy or girl?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Um.I can't tell, and I'm not changing diapers just to look... and don't be silly,&#34; Willow replied.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama.pick. Pick, mama.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well you heard...him...her.it.&#34; Willow bent down and picked up the small child, much to its delight. &#34;See...the kid thinks you're...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;MAMA!&#34; the child cried, one chubby little arm, reaching out in Buffy's direction.</p>
<p>&#34;You were saying?&#34; Willow replied smugly.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh...no.not me,&#34; Buffy stuttered.</p>
<p>Willow didn't notice the intense look the child was giving her.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama,&#34; the child uttered patting Willow on the cheek, then turned holding both arms out, hands opening and closing at Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh...see, the baby wants you, Buffy.&#34; Willow said, walking toward her friend.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't be ridiculous, Will. I'll never be a mother,&#34; Buffy said resignedly.</p>
<p>Willow could feel the tears fill her eyes, there had to be something she could do.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh...yeah, I almost forgot about you,&#34; Willow told the child. &#34;Buffy...&#34; The child held onto Willow with one hand and reached for Buffy with the other.</p>
<p>&#34;MAMA!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;This kid's confused,&#34; Buffy told Willow, who became suddenly very quiet. &#34;Will...are you okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Mama...'kay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Even the kid wants to know, Will.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow looked at the child, staring into the most unusual eyes; they were blue, green and brown.</p>
<p>&#34;Hey,&#34; she whispered, &#34;Show me mama...show me mama,&#34; she instructed, and the child's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama...'ere,&#34; the child laughed, pointing to Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;See...I told you, the kid thinks you're its mother.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Show me mama,&#34; Willow asked once again, her heart pounding rapidly. She already knew what was going to happen. The child looked from Willow back to Buffy and reached for Buffy's neck.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama.'ere...good?&#34; the child asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes... very good,&#34; Willow replied, kissing the child on the cheek.</p>
<p>&#34;Kiss?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes...kiss.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Good,&#34; the child replied, smiling.</p>
<p>&#34;You can't be serious?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Mama?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Willow replied.</p>
<p>&#34;Will...what do you think you're doing? You can't honestly believe that you...me...we're its mother?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Mama kiss?&#34; the child asked, puckering its lips. Willow kissed the child who laughed out loud. &#34;Mama kiss,&#34; the child stated, turning towards Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm 'not' kissing that kid,&#34; Buffy stated angrily. She couldn't believe that Willow would.could think that they were...'Parents?'</p>
<p>&#34;Mama?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm NOT your mother.&#34;</p>
<p>The child's lips began to tremble, tears filling its eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;Please...Buffy...for me?&#34; Willow asked, clutching the child tightly.</p>
<p>&#34;You're not playing fair, Will.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;'Ease, mama?&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy gave in, as she moved to kiss the child on the cheek, Willow decided to kiss the other side. They both closed their eyes and kissed...</p>
<p>Each other. The child had moved just as they were about to kiss its cheeks.</p>
<p>Their eyes popped open...</p>
<hr width=100>
<p><p> Willow stared into her friend's face, and realized they were no longer dreaming... And they were still kissing.<hr width=100>
<p>Shocked as they were, they didn't stop, and neither of them could figure out why. Buffy deepened the kiss, and Willow followed, letting Buffy lead. They seemed to be on autopilot, their tongues melding and twisting, and then finally after a few minutes, they broke away.</p>
<p>They both looked down at their laps, feeling embarrassment and shame at what had just happened.</p>
<p>&#34;What was that?&#34; Willow asked slowly.</p>
<p>&#34;That was.something.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Definitely something.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You don't think you're my.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No.&#34; Willow shook her head quickly. &#34;I can't be. That's impossible.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I mean.yeah, how could you be? Both females here, friends, there's no way.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Nope.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No way at all. Um.did you like it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Did you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Mechanically, it was very good, points for technique, but it was wrong. Completely.&#34;</p>
<p>'Liar.'</p>
<p>Willow thought back to her dream. She could've saved Buffy, but for some reason, she didn't. &#34;Wait.let's.think for a minute. Honesty is good, right?&#34; Buffy nodded. &#34;Then.I didn't think it was.that bad.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, as long as we're being honest, I didn't mind it either.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What did you dream before?&#34; They both asked at the same time.</p>
<p>Slowly, they recounted each of their dreams to each other. By the time they were finished, they were worried that maybe there was more to what had just happened then they thought.</p>
<p>&#34;So what does this mean?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;That something's trying to tell us.something.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We should talk to Giles tomorrow. Or.you know what I mean. Sleep?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Um, Buffy? It's 6:30.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Buffy thought a minute. &#34;Giles is probably up by now, don't you think?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah. Let's go.&#34; They started to rush out the door, when Willow looked at their clothes. &#34;Pajamas.&#34;</p>
<p>They changed, and then left for Giles'.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>During their walk to Giles' house, Buffy started having pains. She suppressed them, kept her face neutral, and kept going, keeping pace with Willow.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>By the time they'd reached his place, the silence was about to drive them crazy, because neither of them had brought up what had happened. Knocking on the door, Willow waited for Giles.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy...Willow, is something wrong?&#34; he asked as soon as he opened the door and saw them standing there.</p>
<p>&#34;Will, you tell him, I'll be right back,&#34; Buffy said, walking past Giles and heading towards the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#34;Tell me what? Has something happened?&#34; he asked, as he ushered Willow inside.</p>
<p>&#34;We...that is Buffy and I had a dream...last night,&#34; Willow replied sitting on the couch.</p>
<p>&#34;I take it, that they had to do with the problem at hand?&#34; Willow nodded. &#34;I see, well, you might as well tell me about them,&#34; Giles told her, as he sat down.</p>
<p>&#34;I guess I'll tell you mine first,&#34; Willow said. &#34;We...we were at Buffy's funeral...&#34; she began, telling him everything she could remember, her voice faltering when she got to one of the most difficult parts of the dream. &#34;...then...then Xander...me,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
<p>&#34;What was that Willow? I didn't hear that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Xander slapped me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He did what?&#34; He asked, wide-eyed.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy wasn't sure how long she could stay in the bathroom without them wondering what was going on. She stared at her reflection in the mirror. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she was very pale. Turning on the cold water, she rinsed out her mouth, wiping away the tiny residue of blood from the side of her mouth.</p>
<p>'This isn't good,' she told herself. 'How the hell did that prophecy go?' she thought, wracking her brain.</p>
<p>&#34;DAMN IT!&#34; she said out loud, quickly looking at the bathroom door, hoping they hadn't heard her.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she splashed her face a few times, patting herself dry with a towel and headed into the living room.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p><p> &#34;He did what?&#34; <br></p>
 'She most have told him what Xander did,' Buffy thought, feeling a burning rage hit her. <p>She shook it off. After all, it was only a dream. &#34;He slapped her Giles,&#34; Buffy replied, taking her spot on the couch.</p>
<p>'Oh my God!' Willow thought, when Buffy came in. &#34;You okay?&#34; she asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, yeah...I'm fine,&#34; she replied.</p>
<p>Giles looked on, knowing she was lying. Anyone could see that she was sick.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you sure? Would you like some tea, or something?&#34; he asked gently, trying not to push it, even though he knew he should.</p>
<p>&#34;No, I'm fine. Will, why don't you finish,&#34; she told her friend, as she curled up, fighting off the chills that had suddenly gripped her body.</p>
<p>Willow told Giles the rest of her dream, while keeping an eye on her friend.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes...well, I can see how that was very distressing for you Willow, and I'm sorry I had to put you through it once more. Are you quite sure that's what Xander said...after...?&#34; he asked, trying to push aside the powerful images Willow's dream had brought forth.</p>
<p>'I failed her...' he thought.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes...he...he said it was my fault,&#34; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#34;It's not your fault. How many times do I need to tell you that?&#34; Buffy said angrily, oddly wishing she could pound the stuffing out of Xander for putting Willow through this. Instead, she reached out and took hold of Willow's hand and squeezed it, offering her support.</p>
<p>&#34;I know, but...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No 'buts' Willow,&#34; Giles said, standing up and pacing. &#34;Would you tell me Buffy's dream please? Perhaps there's a clue...something we're missing.&#34;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later.</p>
<p>&#34;Why didn't you call me afterwards?&#34; He asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Um...we didn't want to wake you?&#34; Willow answered, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#34;Really...you two should know by now, that I'm always available, especially now, given the circumstances.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We haven't told you the best part yet Giles,&#34; Buffy told him, feeling somewhat better after drinking the tea Giles had practically forced down her throat. Of course, she hadn't told either of them about the blood she had coughed up earlier.</p>
<p>&#34;You mean there's more?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah...we didn't really want to go to sleep...and so...um...well, I...that's to say we slept... well not really, we talked a lot but not about the dreams, until later, anyway I was in Buffy's bed...not doing anything, except talking and we fell asleep...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We shared a dream,&#34; Buffy said interrupting Willow's nervous ramblings.</p>
<p>&#34;You both had the same dream?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>
<p>&#34;I didn't know you could do that. Giles?&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;No...nor did I. And this, dream, was it about Buffy's...?&#34; he trailed off.</p>
<p>&#34;No.no, in fact, it was kinda nice,&#34; Willow jumped in.</p>
<p>&#34;For you Will, but I still don't think we're that kid's parents...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Parents...? What child?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, you saw the way it reacted.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What reaction...?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Will...if you hadn't asked, 'Show me Mama'...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Mama?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;It kept calling...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;WAIT!&#34; Giles shouted, startling both Buffy and Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;What?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Would you please tell me about the dream?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy and I went into a house...the funny thing was, I sort of felt as if I had been there before,&#34; Willow started off saying.</p>
<p>&#34;You got that too?&#34; Buffy asked surprised.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah...when did you...?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ladies...please, can we continue with the dream, then we can go over feelings, impressions later?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay...well, we went into the house and we could hear a baby crying...&#34;</p>
<p>Giles nodded as he took notes. &#34;Is there something wrong?&#34; he asked when Willow suddenly stopped her narration.</p>
<p>&#34;Umm...&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Did something happen after you both kissed the child?&#34; he asked. He was going to ask Willow exactly how she knew the child in question would react to 'show me mama'.</p>
<p>&#34;That's...we didn't.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You mean you didn't kiss the child?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No...&#34; Willow replied, her face burning.</p>
<p>&#34;We kissed,&#34; Buffy simply stated, handling the situation.</p>
<p>&#34;I...I'm not sure I understand,&#34; he said, looking at Buffy, then noticing how Willow held her head down.</p>
<p>Sighing, Buffy told him, &#34;We were going to kiss the kid, we both closed our eyes and instead of kissing the kid, we kissed each other.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The kid moved,&#34; she shrugged.</p>
<p>&#34;I...I see,&#34; he said taking off his glasses and polishing them. &#34;Then what happened?&#34; he asked, hoping he wouldn't regret asking.</p>
<p>&#34;We woke up,&#34; Willow answered.</p>
<p>&#34;Ah...then you came to see me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You could say that,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>
<p>Giles felt that they were hiding something, but decided to ask Buffy about it later.</p>
<p>&#34;Well...I'm not sure about you two, but I'm quite famished. Would you like to join me for breakfast?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Why not? But only if we can go to the pancake house,&#34; she answered.</p>
<p>&#34;Agreed. If you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll be right back,&#34; Giles said as he got up and walked to his bathroom.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>He opened his medicine cabinet and grabbed the toothpaste. Closing the cabinet, he proceeded to brush his teeth. As he was about to recap the tube, the top fell from his grasp and down to the floor. Sighing, he bent down to pick it up, when his eyes zeroed in on something he knew wasn't there before.</p>
<p>On the side of the sink was blood, and he carefully placed his hand next to it. Slamming the toothbrush and toothpaste down, Giles stormed out of the bathroom.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Buffy!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah Giles?&#34; she replied, wondering why he looked upset.</p>
<p>&#34;Giles, what's wrong?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, I need to know something, and I want you to be completely honest with me,&#34; he told her.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Are you menstruating?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't believe I need to repeat myself,&#34; he told her.</p>
<p>&#34;No...Anyway, that's not something you come right out with and ask a girl about.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then why,&#34; He said with forced calmness, &#34;are there bloody fingerprints on the side of the sink! I know for a fact that I haven't cut myself shaving recently,&#34; he told her. &#34;Buffy...?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Umm.&#34; She thought a second. &#34;You want the truth? Okay, well.I've been fighting vamps for so long.stopping them from chowing down.and a part of me has always wondered what the big deal is about blood.so I've been tasting my own?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, if you were going to lie to me, you could have picked something a tad less disgusting.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; She looked down at her feet. &#34;I'm not thinking very well.&#34;</p>
<p>Her face suddenly became very white, and Willow rushed over and started pushing her towards the bathroom. Giles started to follow. &#34;I got it. I have a feeling we'll be canceling that trip to the pancake house.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Willow rubbed Buffy's back as her friend coughed up more blood into the sink. She could see that Buffy's eyes were watery. After a minute, the blood stopped coming, and Willow sat her down on top of the toilet seat.</p>
<p>&#34;This is bad, Buffy.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I have too much blood anyway.&#34; Buffy tried to joke.</p>
<p>&#34;That was a lot of blood, and you know it. We have to figure out what to do. You're falling apart on me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Just a little.&#34; Willow frowned at her. &#34;Could you hand me one of the towels?&#34;</p>
<p>Willow got one of the towels off the rack by the sink, and Buffy wiped her mouth. When she realized she put blood stains on Giles' white towel she smiled guiltily.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm sure it'll come out.&#34; She examined the pattern on the towel. &#34;Hey, look. Giles has towels with hearts on 'em. Isn't that wei.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy stopped, trailing off. 'A symbol of love will bring about two halves made whole.' Looking at Willow, Buffy saw that she had just thought the same thing. Willow walked over and looked at the towel too, and they both went wide-eyed.</p>
<p>The hearts were gone. And so was Buffy's blood. It was just a plain, white towel. &#34;GILES!&#34; They both yelled, leaving the bathroom.<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Okay.we're both not liking this prophecy.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;Well I should hope not.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Willow asked, a little confused.</p>
<p>&#34;What with Buffy's death being prophesied.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Besides that. It looks like it's trying to tell us that,&#34; Buffy pointed between her and Willow, &#34;we're true loves.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ah.I see. Can you be sure?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Everything the prophecy said has happened. In one way or another.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;But it's not possible. No way.I mean.&#34; Buffy said, becoming less and less sure of herself.</p>
<p>&#34;No.no.it's.not.&#34; Willow agreed, also not as sure.</p>
<p>They turned and looked at each other, both remembering what had happened only a few hours ago. 'The kiss.was.wow.'</p>
<p>&#34;Well, if you're absolutely sure, we could keep looking, but considering that Buffy seems to be getting worse.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What are you saying, Giles?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Nothing. Simply that certain things happen for a reason, and that you should be sure that you're paying attention to where the signs are pointing before you make a wrong turn.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Could you get me something to eat, Giles? I'm hungry for some bizarre reason.&#34;</p>
<p>Truthfully, they just wanted some time to themselves to figure things out, and having Giles there would add unnecessary tension.</p>
<p>&#34;Me too.&#34; Willow piped in.</p>
<p>&#34;If you think you two will be all right,&#34; Giles said, not sure if he should leave. Buffy seemed to be getting worse by the second, and that coupled with her and Willow's dreams seeming awfully foretelling, kept him second-guessing his course of action. Kept him thinking about what he said in Willow's dream. 'I failed her.'</p>
<p>He didn't want to do that. But although he wasn't aware of it yet, he had already helped to save her.</p>
<p>&#34;We're sure.&#34; They said together.</p>
<p>&#34;I'll run by the bagel shop then.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Buffy and Willow said, half-listening.</p>
<p>Reluctant for a second, Giles eventually left, and shut the door. The two of them snapped out of their thoughts, and sat down on the couch.</p>
<p>&#34;Let's um.think about this.&#34; Buffy said, almost rationally.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah. What's the best that could happen?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You save my life.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow smiled at that. She could save Buffy's life. &#34;What's the worst that could happen?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Honestly, right now, I can't think of anything really bad.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Good. Then it's not just me. So.what happens -&#34; Willow cut herself off, as Buffy clutched her stomach, and clenched her eyes shut. She started to shake, and fell off the couch. &#34;No.Buffy, what do I do?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p><p> 'Don't panic...don't panic,' Willow thought as she went to her fallen companion. She hated the fact had it been anyone else 'but' Buffy; they would have been on their way to the hospital by now. Checking Buffy's forehead, she was relieved to find that her friend did not have a fever.<p>She knew Giles would not be back soon, and she really didn't want to call Xander to come over and help. Willow shook her head. It had only been a dream, but she couldn't reconcile the fact that he had slapped her and blamed her for Buffy's death.</p>
<p>&#34;Buf...Buffy, I'm going to try to get you back on the couch, okay?&#34; she said as she slid her hands underneath Buffy's arms and gently pulled her upright.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay...now...all I need to do is get behind you and...&#34; she grunted, as she stepped back onto Giles' couch dragging Buffy's prone body with her. &#34;No...stop!&#34; she cried out when she released her grip and Buffy began to slide back to the floor.</p>
<p>Willow finally managed to get Buffy on the couch, after a few failed attempts. She returned with the first-aid kit hoping she wouldn't have to use it, shaking her head, and sitting down, proceeding to look for another ammonia capsule.</p>
<p>'He's out of them, now what do I do?' she asked herself.</p>
<p>She didn't understand what was happening, according to the prophecy, 'Falsehood renders one weak; destroys the other.' It was obvious that whatever 'was' happening, it was killing...or rather 'destroying' her best friend. Taking Buffy's hand in hers, she knelt down next to the couch.</p>
<p>&#34;Hey...um...I'm not one hundred percent sure if you can hear me or not, but I'll take my chances,&#34; Willow began. &#34;Don't give up...we need you here...I...I need you here. I...I was so mad at you for leaving when you did...you know? I...I understood 'why' you had to...but it still hurt,&#34; she said, her thumb tracing tiny circles over the back of Buffy's hand.</p>
<p>&#34;Buf...Buffy, I...um...I'm really hoping that...thedreamwesharedcomestrue,&#34; she blurted out quickly. Bending closer, until her lips were next to Buffy's ear, Willow told her friend the truth. &#34;I'd...I think you'd be a great mom...'Mama',&#34; she said smiling gently.</p>
<p>Then taking a deep breath, she whispered, &#34;Buffy...you can't leave...I...I...I love you... really. I don't want to be 'mama' by myself, we're going to need you there, I mean...who else can show the kid how to handle vamp attacks but its 'mama'. I...um...that is...I'm pretty sure...I know I want to,&#34; Willow looked around quickly, then shook her head.</p>
<p>'Of course I'm alone silly,' she thought.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay...I'd...I'd really...really like to kiss you again.but...not like this morning. That's not to say I didn't like this morning's kiss, I did...honest, it's just that I don't want to be dreaming...or...or at the end of a dream...or anything like that. Nope...just you and me, both fully awake...so, you see, you have to wake up, please?&#34; she beseeched her.</p>
<p>'Well, we haven't...so...we're not...I guess we're still best friends,' Willow mused. She looked into Buffy's face and felt a sudden change. 'Oh my gosh! I DO love her,' she thought. 'I'm IN love with her.'</p>
<p>The thought hit her hard, and she gasped for breath as her mind was bombarded with memories. Only this time she saw them...really saw them and what they meant. Then wanting nothing else but to be with her true love, she leaned over and kissed her.</p>
<p>&#34;Hey G-man...I...brought...the...Willow? Why are you...? Are you kissing Buffy?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Willow turned around quickly, and faced Xander. He looked confused, his eyes darting to Buffy and back to her. She looked too. Buffy hadn't moved.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander.hi.I wasn't.you should go. Going is good. Please go.&#34;</p>
<p>He didn't. He walked closer to Willow and then past her, his eyes on Buffy's unmoving form. &#34;What's going on, Will?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Nothing. Buffy's just tired and you're going to wake her up, so.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She doesn't look asleep. She looks.dead.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Dead tired. Whoo! You know how she gets sometimes. Zonks out.&#34;</p>
<p>To Xander, it seemed like Willow was hiding something. Putting together Buffy's stillness and Willow's evasive word jumble, his irrational anger side kicked in. He stood over the couch.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm calling 911. Get her to a hospital.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You.you can't!&#34; Willow yelled, panicky.</p>
<p>Holding Giles' phone in his hand, he stared Willow directly in the eyes. &#34;Why? What did you do?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I didn't do anything.there's things that are -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You did this to her didn't you? What was it? A spell? Were you doing CPR? Did you screw up? What?&#34;</p>
<p>'No.it was a dream. This can't be happening. Maybe I did screw up.I was too late.'</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know.I don't.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What do you mean you don't know? You can't come clean because this is you're fault, isn't it?&#34; Willow started to cry, and Xander didn't react. He just started to dial 911 as he looked back at Buffy. &#34;Maybe there's still a chance to save her.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow grabbed his arm. She couldn't let him call the hospital. There were too many things that.he yanked her off, and raised his arm to her. Before he could connect, he felt a hand grab his arm from behind.</p>
<p>&#34;What the hell do you think you're doing?&#34; A newly awakened Buffy half-asked, and screamed. She pulled him down to the ground, and put a foot on his chest, waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy? You're okay.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks to Willow. So I ask again, what the hell did you think you were doing?&#34;</p>
<p>Xander was completely confused. He couldn't understand what was going on, plus his actions didn't even register to him yet. Buffy, furious for not getting an answer, grabbed him by his shirt collar, and pulled him up, staring him in the face.</p>
<p>&#34;Let him go, Buffy.&#34; Willow said gently.</p>
<p>&#34;He almost slapped you!&#34;</p>
<p>'I almost slapped her? God. I almost did. ' He felt sick. What had come over him?</p>
<p>&#34;But he didn't. And I don't think he wanted to.&#34;</p>
<p>'Of course I didn't, Will.' He couldn't bring himself to speak.</p>
<p>&#34;I don't care, he would have.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Maybe, but the difference between this and 'that,&#34; Willow said referring to the dream that had haunted her for so long, &#34;is that you were here to stop him. It didn't happen. You prevented it.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Xander, and could see the guy had no idea what they were talking about. And the fact that he was going to go home and replay this moment in his mind over and over, had her thinking that was punishment enough. Guilt was a nasty thing. She'd forgive him, not as quickly as Willow just had, but she would.</p>
<p>She let go of him, and walked up to Willow. &#34;Correction. We prevented it. Xander.go. Please.&#34;</p>
<p>Without a word, and looking at the two of them, ashamed, he trudged out of the house.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;He was only concerned about you. I mean if I were him and he were me.I would have.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know he was.but you're not him. You're you, and I wouldn't want you any other way.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Does this mean.you're okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think it means we both are. Oh.and I heard every word.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And?&#34; Willow asked hesitantly, even when she knew what the answer was, but needing reassurance.</p>
<p>She felt Buffy's arms go around her.</p>
<p>Then, Buffy kissed her so strongly that she was surprised that she could still breathe. She eventually became a willing participant as they stood there, showing each other what it took them so long to figure out. That they were as true as true loves could get.</p>
<p>&#34;Does that answer your question?&#34; Buffy asked after they stopped. Willow just nodded silently, smiling, as they moved to sit on the couch.</p>
<p>&#34;So...what do we do next?&#34; Willow asked, glancing towards Buffy, their hands interlocked.</p>
<p>&#34;Um...I'm not really sure. I mean, I love the kissing, yep, it's number one on my things to do list: 'Number One, Kiss Willow'&#34;, she said, leaning in and gently brushing her lips against Willow's. &#34;I can check that off,&#34; Buffy said smiling, making a motion as if checking off a list.</p>
<p>&#34;I believe I'm starting to like this list,&#34; Willow said eagerly.</p>
<p>&#34;I thought you might,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>
<p>She was about to lean in and make sure she had properly checked off the first item, when they both heard the door being opened. Willow quickly moved down the couch, leaving Buffy slightly confused by her action.</p>
<p>&#34;I've...I've brought the bagels...&#34; Giles said as he stepped into his apartment. As soon as he closed the door, he felt an underlying current of tension. &#34;Is something wrong?&#34; he asked.</p>
<p>&#34;No...nothing's wrong, everything is fine...&#34; Willow stopped, got off the couch and ran towards the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; Giles asked perplexed.</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know,&#34; she replied getting off the couch, &#34;but, I'm going to find out.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy reached the door and tried the handle, but it was locked. She decided to try and tap on the door.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow...Wills? What's wrong? Open the door please?&#34; she asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I...I...can't,&#34; Willow replied.</p>
<p>&#34;Why not, is the door stuck?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I...can't...be...your...true...love,&#34; Willow hiccuped, tears streaming down her face as she looked at the door.</p>
<p>&#34;What? Willow...what are you saying?&#34; Buffy demanded, her heart pounding in her chest.</p>
<p>&#34;How...how...can...can...I,&#34; Willow couldn't finish as her body was wracked by sobs.</p>
<p>&#34;What's wrong?&#34; Giles asked, having gone to see what was taking Buffy so long.</p>
<p>Buffy gestured Giles to follow her and she explained what had happened since he had been gone.</p>
<p>&#34;I see,&#34; he replied. &#34;I swear to you Buffy, Xander doesn't...ah...never mind. Would you like me to speak with her?&#34; he offered.</p>
<p>&#34;No...I've got to, but thanks,&#34; she said, smiling warmly.</p>
<p>&#34;I'll be out here... if you need anything,&#34; he said, giving into his paternal impulses and hugged Buffy. &#34;Good luck,&#34; he told her, then walked back to the living room and opened the newspaper. Buffy smiled and shook her head.</p>
<p>'Ah well, let's get to it,' she thought. &#34;Hey Will...are you still there?&#34; she asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow replied in a tiny voice.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay, just wanted to make sure you hadn't skipped out on me...I mean, I still have a whole list to get through, and confidentially speaking...you're on most of it,&#34; Buffy explained, having no idea what she was going to do to get Willow out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>She frowned, 'This is going to be harder than I thought,' she mused, when she received no response from Willow. &#34;I'm just going to sit down...out here, if that's okay with you?&#34; Buffy said as she sat down next to the doorframe, reaching out and touching the wood grain.</p>
<p>&#34;Shall I tell you what else is on the list?&#34; she asked, not expecting a reply. &#34;Well...we both know what number one was and I'd like to think we'd get another chance to do it again...maybe a little longer?</p>
<p>&#34;Okay...on to number two: 'Number Two, Tell Willow How Much She Means To You.' Willow...you...you mean everything to me. I'm not going to lie and tell you...that I...I didn't think Angel was the one...&#34;</p>
<p>Willow glanced at the door when Angel's name was mentioned.</p>
<p>&#34;But...no matter how much we both wanted it...we got burned. I guess we were each other's moths and candles... does that make sense?&#34; Willow nodded, blowing her nose and moving closer to the door. &#34;Um...that brings up number three: 'Sing',&#34; Buffy whispered.</p>
<p>'Oh, that's great...what have you gotten yourself into...you can't sing,' she chastised herself.</p>
<p>Willow was astonished that Buffy would sing to her.</p>
<p>Buffy thought hard about which song to butcher...'All for the sake of love,' she thought.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not very good at this Will...so...so don't not come out because of my singing okay? 'You mean the world to me... you are my everything, I swear the only thing that matters...matters to me.'&#34; Willow smiled. &#34;I think we can skip ahead to number four, don't you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I...I kind of liked number three,&#34; Willow replied.</p>
<p>&#34;You did?&#34; Buffy said, excitedly, she was getting through.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow answered truthfully.</p>
<p>Buffy went on to tell Willow what the other items she had on her to do list.</p>
<p>&#34;We...we can't do that...can we?&#34; Willow asked, blushing.</p>
<p>&#34;We won't know 'til we try,&#34; Buffy answered.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy...?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, Will?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Um...how...how...did you hear about...number nine?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That...would be telling, wouldn't it,&#34; she replied.</p>
<p>&#34;So...what's number ten?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Ah...number ten. We might have to wait for a while for that one.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We haven't found the house yet,&#34; she replied.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Willow sat against the door, and smiled. Buffy wanted.everything with her. And she wanted it back, but.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow?&#34; Buffy asked on the other side.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why are you in there?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know.I'm worried I guess.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;About what?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Stuff. How we're supposed to handle 'this' kinda stuff.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The same way we handle everything. Together.&#34; Willow's smile widened. But Buffy was making it sound so.easy. It wasn't going to be easy. &#34;Of course it's not going to be easy, but.&#34;</p>
<p>'She read my mind.'</p>
<p>&#34;But nothing worth it, is ever easy, Will. We all know that for a fact, don't we?&#34;</p>
<p>Even though Buffy couldn't see, she still nodded. &#34;Are you saying we're worth it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I would never lie to you about 'us'. I hope you know that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Will, without you, I'd be dead. Literally. I love you, and I know you love me, so come outta there. Please.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow realized that that was what she had been waiting for. It was one thing to be shown how much she was loved by Buffy, but the words.she needed to hear them. She got up, and opened the door.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy stood up immediately, when she felt the door move. She faced Willow, who came out, and hugged her tightly. Buffy responded just as strongly. She wished she had realized this sooner. Realized what Willow meant to her sooner. But.the past was the past. Time to move on.</p>
<p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Willow whispered.</p>
<p>&#34;Shouldn't I be thanking you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No. When you love someone, saving their life comes with it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then what are you thanking me for?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;For loving me back.&#34;</p>
<p>This was a kiss moment. They both knew it, and acted on it. Willow made it longer, just as Buffy had hoped and somehow.stronger. They broke away eventually, and Buffy rested her forehead on top of Willow's.</p>
<p>&#34;We just can't seem to get off number one.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm in no rush to. Although, I would like to hear number three again soon.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No way.&#34; Willow pouted. &#34;Fine. But it'll be a duet.&#34;</p>
<p>They walked slowly back to where Giles was, their arms around one another. He saw them out of the corner of his eye, and set the newspaper down.</p>
<p>&#34;The prophecy has not been fulfilled, I take it?&#34; He asked, smiling at them.</p>
<p>&#34;You kidding? We killed the prophecy. The prophecy gods will think twice about messing with us again.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;You tell 'em, Will. Giles it's been, okay, not entirely fun, but Willow and I have to go.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know. I guess we'll know where we're going when we get there. Some place fun. And not having to do anything with death at all.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;So.like.a date?&#34;</p>
<p>They moved towards the front door, as Giles just watched.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah.like a date.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy opened the door.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, Buffy?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
<p>Giles heard one last sentence before they were gone.</p>
<p>&#34;What do you want to name the baby?&#34;</p>
