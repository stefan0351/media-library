<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 7 -->

<p>Sam was on her third circuit through the park before her thoughts slowed down enough for her to make heads or tails of them. She knew she'd reacted badly to Brooke and probably hurt her in the process but the whole situation was so surreal that she just panicked. It was everything she dreamed, everything she wanted and she was sure Brooke was playing with her. While she couldn't really dismiss the possiblity that Brooke was gay or bi, she highly doubted that the blonde was as head over heels in love with her as she claimed. It just didn't jive with the information Sam did have and was familiar with. </p>
<p>(She probably thinks I'm insane) she sighed. (And given the way I acted, that would be fairly accurate) She rolled her eyes. (Why the Hell did I DO that?) She knew that if Brooke was genuine, she had just blown any chance she had with the beautiful blonde straight to Hell. </p>
<p>(She'll never forgive that reaction from me) Sam lamented. (She'll think I was disgusted or horrified and never believe that I care for her too. I think I just destroyed my life) She sat down and cradled her head in her hands. </p>
<p>(I can't go back to that house) she decided. (I can't face her again. If she really does care for me then I just hurt her. And if she'd just playing with me, she'll use this to obliterate me at school. She'll go running to Nicole and Mary Cherry and have a big old laugh at my expense) And she didn't want that. She wasn't sure she could survive the humiliation, especially at the hands of Brooke. </p>
<p>But, then again...) she thought, anger beginning to overcome shock and fear. (Why should I be the one to run away? I didn't do anything. Technically SHE kissed ME, not the other way around. If she thinks she can just scare me off like that then she's got another thing coming) Sam decided. A somewhat devious smile pulled at the corners of her mouth. </p>
<p>(OK, Brooke, you wanna play that way, let's see how far you're willing to take it) she challenged silently. With a plan forming quickly in her mind, she started the trek back to the house. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>When she returned to the Palace she saw that her mother's car was gone and another smile spread across her face. </p>
<p>(Perfect. If Brooke is home then the two of us will have the entire house to ourselves. I'll either call her bluff or...or...) Sam faltered in her thoughts for a second and wondered what she was going to do if Brooke was sincere. Shrugging it off to an 'it'll never happen' state of mind, she marched into the house. </p>
<p>She went upstairs and heard the shower running. Her plan failed her for a moment as she almost backed out of what she was thinking of doing. She knew if it backfired the wrong way, she'd be in a lot of trouble. But Sam was tired of whatever game Brooke was playing and decided that it was worth the risk. She went to her room and stripped down to her underwear. Taking one last deep breath to fortify herself, she entered the bathroom. </p>
<p>The change in air pressure immediately clued Brooke into the presence of someone else as she rinsed out her hair. Through the frosted shower door, she could just make out Sam's semi-clad form and her breath caught in her throat. </p>
<p>"Sam?" she asked quietly from within the shower. She watched Sam walk closer to the shower door. </p>
<p>"Yeah?" Sam responded in the same tone. </p>
<p>"What are you doing?" She heard Sam chuckle and it gave her goosebumps in the warm shower. Sam's head suddenly appeared around the door. </p>
<p>"What do you WANT me to be doing?" Sam asked huskily as she looked upon Brooke's naked body for the first time. She doubted that she had ever seen anything as beautiful as the blonde in front of her in her entire life. Her dreams were nothing compared to the real thing. Brooke swallowed and looked Sam in the eye shyly. </p>
<p>"Honestly?" she asked timidly. Sam nodded, her eyes hooded with undisguised desire and lust. The look was making Brooke shake with need and anticipation. </p>
<p>"Join me?" she asked, stretching out her hand. Sam arched an eyebrow at the invite. </p>
<p>(Did she really just invite me to join her in the shower?) she wondered to herself. But as she stared at Brooke's outstretched hand and the look of longing on the cheerleaders face, she realized it wasn't a game. Sam also realized that she wanted nothing more than to comply. </p>
<p>She grasped Brooke's hand and stepped into the shower still clad in her underwear. Brooke watched as the water slowly soaked through Sam's garments to reveal the body underneath, and she sucked in an unsteady breath. Sam was breathtaking. Without saying a word, she reached up and slid the straps of the bra off of Sam's shoulders and down her arms. When Sam didn't protest, she stepped closer and reached around in back to undo the unneeded article of clothing. Once it was unfastened, she tossed it carelessly aside. </p>
<p>Sam leaned into Brooke's shower warm body. She was spinning out of control and didn't care. She didn't want this to stop and from the look on Brooke's face, neither did she. Sam gasped involuntarily as Brooke bent down and placed light kisses on her breasts while stroking her nipples with her thumbs. Her eyes rolled back and her head fell loosely onto her shoulders as Brooke continued to taste her. </p>
<p>Brooke ran her hands down Sam's sides but stopped when she reached the waistband of Sam's panties. She looked up into Sam's face and saw only pleasure and contentment there so she became a little more bold. She knelt down in front of Sam in the shower and slowly lowered the scrap of cloth down the gorgeous body standing before her. Sam stepped out of them and they joined the bra somewhere in the farthest reaches of the bathroom. </p>
<p>Still on her knees, thanking anyone upstairs that would listen for the opportunity, Brooke looked back up at Sam. Hazel eyes met brown in a stare that went straight to their souls. </p>
<p>"Are you sure?" </p>
<p>"Yes. Absolutely," were the only real words spoken between the two for a very long time. </p>
