<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>When the news came back from France that Lord Kim and his loyal man at arms had fallen at the battle of Agincourt it could not have come at a worse time for the family of the wealthy Lord.  His wife and son were without protection and isolated on his large estate at a time when the peasants were beginning to revolt against the oppression of the feudal Lords.  When Henry V had cried 'once more into the breech for England,' Lord Kim and Jonathan Torrance had answered the call and paid with their lives.  It seemed now that their lives were not the only ones to be put to the hazard as a result of that rallying cry.  The news had spread like wildfire that Lady Kim and her young son Harry were defenseless in the manor house.  It was common knowledge that young Lord Kim was no warrior.  The farmers and labourers had been gathering for days on the farm of Robert Johnson, and as they talked and consumed the sweet mead that was produced in the region they filled one another's heads with plans to seize the land for themselves.  Eventually, late on the fifth night since the news arrived, a drunken mob formed and made its way toward the manor house.</p>
<p>Harry was terrified and begged his mother to hide, but she refused, secure in the knowledge that the peasants knew their place in the world and would never dare offer her insult.  She could not have been more wrong.  When the mob arrived on her doorstep she stepped out to greet them, and ordered them to return to their farms and their labour.  The mob taunted her, closing around her much to her terror.  The sounds and the smells of the common man were far beyond her ken.  Her voice rose shrilly and she threatened retribution and the repossession of land if they did not cease and desist immediately in the name of the King.  This was an error on her part as the horde had no particular loyalty to the king, and was frankly angry at the taxes the king levied against them in order to carry out his fratricidal war with France.  The rabble swirled around her, their anger reaching its peak and soon her lifeless body could be seen swinging from the branch of a tall tree that grew in front of the house.</p>
<p>B'Elanna Torrance had been sleeping in the stables when the mob arrived.  She had not been able to bring herself to return to her father's house since news of his death reached her five days ago.  She had loved her father dearly and had never known her mother.  It was rumored that her mother had been one of the savage Keltoi of the north.  Other rumors abounded that Jonathon and B'Elanna had Saracen blood running through their veins brought back from her ancestor's time in the crusades.  In any case they had been swarthy and strong, and fiercely loyal to the Kim family for many generations.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had grown up with the soldiers Lord Kim had employed to protect his lands and people.  Having no mother she had simply followed her father as he went about his duties, and as such was an accomplished swordsman and rider.  She was lost without her father, she was rough and unschooled in the ways of the world, and without the protection of her father and her Lord she was unsure what would become of her.</p>
<p>She heard the shouts of the mob growing louder and she was finally roused from her slumber.  When she peeked out of the top of the stables she saw to her horror the angry peasants hoisting the body of Lady Kim into the air.  'Harry,' she thought to herself.  She scanned the crowd but saw no sign of her young friend.  She hastened out of the stables and grabbed a short sword from the armoury before she ran to the back of the house to look for the young Lord.</p>
<p>"Harry, where are you?"  she cried racing through the house in a frantic search.</p>
<p>She found him at the front window, tears streaming down his face as he watched the swarm murdering his mother.</p>
<p>"She wouldn't listen to me B'Elanna.  I begged her not to go out there, but she just wouldn't listen."  His voice was ragged and broken, his face haggard with sorrow and fear.</p>
<p>"It wasn't your fault Lord Kim, there was nothing you could have done to prevent this.  We have to leave now if you wish to avoid your mother's fate," B'Elanna was pulling on his arm, dragging him toward the back of the house anxious to get the young man out of there before the mob came looking for him.</p>
<p>She finally managed to drag him to the back entrance of the house; they were outside on the walkway when a portion of the angry crowd came around the corner in their own search for the young Lord.</p>
<p>"There he is?.grab him," the sounds of the men were like a roar as the crowd pushed forward toward their position.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pushed Harry behind her, her left arm wide to offer him as much protection as she could.  Her strong right arm held the short sword in front of her body, parallel to the ground as she faced off against the mob.</p>
<p>"Step out of the way Torrance, we have no quarrel with you, and you owe him no loyalty," said an angry young man as he pushed his way to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Robert Johnson why am I not surprised to see you in the thick of this madness."</p>
<p>"Leave now or die with him woman," he said raising his axe and moving closer to where she stood.</p>
<p>B'Elanna shifted her weight, rolling up onto the balls of her feet, ready to move the instant Johnson committed himself to a course of action.  When he swung his axe, she easily sidestepped the blow, still keeping her body between the mob and her friend.  He swung again, this time grazing her left arm with the blow of his axe.  Like a dancer she moved, grasping the hilt of the sword with two hands she spun around, slashing her attacker across the belly with the razor sharp edge of the sword.  He dropped his axe, falling to his knees with a look of confusion on his face as he vainly attempted to stop his intestines from spilling to the ground.</p>
<p>"I may die today in defense of Lord Kim but I swear I will not die alone.  Who among you wishes to be next?"</p>
<p>The crowd was more subdued now, but still confident in their superior numbers they refused to disperse.</p>
<p>"You're deluded the lot of you.  Do you think this insult to the gentry will go unanswered?  Do you really believe the neighbouring lords will just stand aside and wish you luck as you go back to farming your land?  You've done them a favour, when news of this murder spreads they will be rubbing their hands together and dividing up the land between themselves.  You've traded one master for another?nothing more."</p>
<p>"We'll fight them all, England belongs to us as much as it does to them, they'd starve to death if it wasn't for us," another rough looking young man said as he came to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Your delusions are your own concern but you have no quarrel with Harry, all I ask is that you let us go, let us take some food and clothing and we'll be on our way, you can do what you will with the house and the lands."</p>
<p>"He is of the nobility, and as such he is our enemy. He is every bit as guilty as his father of enslaving us, of living in luxury off the sweat of our backs."</p>
<p>"So now the sins of the father are visited on the son?is that it Steven Herrick?  You'd better hope that isn't true, I knew your father."  B'Elanna replied.</p>
<p>The crowd laughed at B'Elanna's reference to the profligate lifestyle of Herrick's father.  The tension was eased somewhat now, but B'Elanna did not relax her vigilance.</p>
<p>"Just let us gather some supplies and we'll be on our way, we want no trouble do we Harry?"</p>
<p>Young Lord Kim was no longer capable of speech, and he merely nodded as the tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>"You can go but only if you leave now.  If you try our patience any longer I'll change my mind and hang you both.  Be gone with you."  The crowd murmured its assent to this course of action.</p>
<p>B'Elanna accepted her defeat for now, and began to walk slowly backwards down the path, guiding Harry as she went.  When she was certain the crowd did not intend to pursue them she turned and began to move swiftly toward the forested land at the back of the property.  She had no idea where there were going but she wanted to put as much distance between themselves and the mob as possible.  Harry lagged behind, stumbling over his feet, blinded in his grief.  She turned back to him and grasped him by the front of his doublet and giving him a hard shake.</p>
<p>"Look at me," she demanded.  "A terrible thing has happened Lord Kim, but we don't have time to grieve just now.  I need you to pay attention to what you are doing, and to run, or we'll both be joining our parents.  Now come on!"</p>
<p>Finally realizing that he was putting his friend's life in danger as well as his own the young Lord began to jog alongside the young woman.  Once they were into the forest B'Elanna kept running, until she led them over a stream and into a series of caves she knew existed from the times in her youth when she would explore the woods in her play.</p>
<p>She led Harry into the depths of the cave and sat the grief stricken young man down, leaning him against the rock wall of the cave.  She went outside and gathered up an armload of sticks and dried grass.  Returning to the cave she used flint and steel to light a small fire.  Once she was finished she slumped back against the rock; the events of the last week catching up with her at last.  She closed her eyes and refused to give in to tears.  Somehow she needed to find a way out of this mess.</p>
<p>After several hours had passed in silence B'Elanna had made up her mind and formulated a plan of sorts.  It was risky but she felt it was their best chance for survival.</p>
<p>She moved over to where the young Lord was leaning against the wall.  "Harry, are you awake?" She asked shaking him lightly.  His eyes when he looked at her were dull and lifeless.  Everything he had known in life had been taken from him tonight.</p>
<p>"I'm going back to the manor to get some food, and horses.  I need you to stay here and keep quiet.  I doubt they'll come looking for us but you can never tell.  Promise me you won't leave the cave."</p>
<p>"You can't go back there, they'll kill you," his voice was panicked and B'Elanna feared he was on the edge of hysteria.</p>
<p>"They'll have to find me first.  Don't worry Harry I'll be careful.  I don't see that we have much choice, if we don't get some food and weapons we'll starve to death before we figure out what we're going to do."  She paused for a moment before asking a difficult question.  "I know you probably have no wish to talk about anything right now, but I need to know if your family kept any gold or silver hidden on the property.  Is there a hiding place you know of where I can search?  We will need money if we're going get by."</p>
<p>When he spoke his voice was toneless and dead. "In my father's study, in the fireplace, there is a stone that is loose.  If you pick it up there is a small hollow beneath it where my father kept his treasure.  If the mob hasn't found it there should be something there."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Harry, I know this is hard. Just promise me you'll stay here all right?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded wordlessly and watched as B'Elanna slipped noiselessly from the cave.</p>
<p>Once in the woods B'Elanna began to move at a loping pace.  She could run for hours like this; she'd always loved the freedom of the woods, and she felt more at home here than she ever did in her father's house.  The woods held no terrors for her normally, but tonight was a night like no other and so she kept her mind alert to every noise around her.  She came to the edge of the woods and saw the glow in the sky, the mob had lit the house on fire, and it was beginning to burn brightly.  She ran swiftly along the hedgerow that ran beside the laneway until she was not far from the house.  She could hear the shouts of the mob and could see people moving in the distance by the light of the fire.</p>
<p>She took her handkerchief and wrapped it around her mouth and nose and slipped up to the servants' entrance to the house. She listened intently for the sounds of anyone inside, and hearing nothing but the growing roar of the flames she gathered her courage and stepped inside the house.</p>
<p>The heat hit her like a wall, and she instinctively bent close to the ground to seek out the cooler air.  The smoke was swirling around her and her eyes began to smart and water instantly.  She steeled herself to her task and moved toward the stone stairs at the back of the house.  She had played with Harry as a child and knew the house as well as she knew her own, and so going blindly on instinct she felt her way up the staircase.  At the top the smoke was so dense she had to crawl along the corridor, feeling her way along the wall until she came to the door she believed led to Lord Kim's study.  Pulling down on the handle she pushed her way into the room.  The smoke was a little less in here as the door had been shut. She moved toward the fireplace noting the irony of the fact that there was a fire burning there.  She used a poker to scatter the logs and move them off the hearth onto the flags of the floor.  Pulling down one of the drapes she tore it into strips and wrapped them around her hands and cleaned the ashes out of the hearth looking for a loose stone.  Finding what she thought was the stone she drew her dagger from her boot and began to pry the stone up from the floor.  When it finally came clear she wrapped the drapes back around her hands and reached into the hole, feeling about for a moment she found what she was looking for.  She pulled a metal bound box from the hiding place, and placing it on the desk she prized the top open and peered inside.  It contained some gold and silver pieces as well as some jewelry.  She only took a cursory look before wrapping it up in the remains of the drapery and heading back out the door.  She crawled through the living room, freezing in terror as one of the roof joists came loose and crashed to the floor near her causing the flames to shoot up to the ceiling.  The heat was almost unbearable as she made her way blindly to the door.</p>
<p>Once again she paused, worried what might be waiting on the other side of the door, but eventually the heat and smoke drove her out. Taking a quick look and seeing no one about she dashed for the cover of the bushes.  Crouching low she surveyed the land surrounding the manor house.  She could see that the angry mob had set one of the outbuildings alight and were currently gathered there, drinking and shouting as they pawed through the family heirlooms they had dragged from the house before setting it alight.  She eased into the darkness, moving silently toward the house she had shared with her father attached to the Kim family armoury.  There didn't seem to be anyone near the house so she slipped through the door; the memories of her life there with her father came flooding over her and she forced herself to clamp down on those feelings and move quickly to get what she would need.</p>
<p>She grabbed two dark cloaks and a pair of sturdy boots, then moving to the pantry she stuffed a loaf of coarse bread and some potatoes, onions and a shank of smoked meat into a sack with the clothing.  She took one last look around the only home she'd ever known and then moved purposely out the door.  She slid soundlessly into the armoury, seeing that the mob had already been there, but that they'd only ransacked the place, they hadn't taken much as of yet.  She buckled on a long sword, and picked up another short sword for Harry, moving swiftly she picked up a crossbow and bolts as well as a long bow and a quiver of arrows.  She couldn't carry everything she'd taken so she stashed some of it in the bushes outside of the stables.</p>
<p>The horses inside were restless, the smell of smoke and the unfamiliar noises of the mob had them spooked.  B'Elanna crept inside and found her way to the stall of the horse she rode most often.  Soothing it gently with her words and her hands she quickly saddled it, leaving it tied just outside the stall she went in search of a horse for Harry.  Once the young Lord's horse was saddled she quickly secured all of the things she had taken onto the spare horse.  She debated attempting to secure another horse to carry the equipment but felt she had pushed her luck as far as she'd dared.  Swinging with ease into the saddle she grasped the lead of the other horse and rode out of the stable.  As fearful as she was she forced herself to move slowly and stay in the shadows, but her luck ran out as she turned a corner and found herself face to face with two of the men from the mob.  She leapt from the saddle, and pulling her sword free of its scabbard in one smooth motion she faced her enemies.</p>
<p>"I don't want to hurt you, but I will if I have to.  We're leaving and we won't be back, there's plenty left here for you lot to divide amongst yourselves, just let me be on my way," she pleaded.</p>
<p>It almost worked, and had the two men been sober they might have let her go, but their drinking had emboldened them and they wanted to know what was strapped to the back of the saddle of the horse.  One of them advanced, the other following closely behind.  B'Elanna reacted quickly.  She struck a resounding blow with the pommel of the sword directly into the face of the leader and he dropped without a sound, blood streaming from his shattered nose.  The second man leapt forward enraged by the sight of his fallen friend.  B'Elanna stepped quickly out of his way, grabbing his shoulder as he went by she threw him easily to the ground.  As he struggled to his feet she cracked him over the back of the head with the hilt of the sword and he too dropped senseless to the ground.</p>
<p>She took a quick look around to ensure that no one else had wandered onto the scene and then dragged the unconscious bodies into the barn, tying them up tightly before remounting.  She skirted the rest of the outbuildings slowly until she had once again reached the relative safety of the hedgerows.  Once she was a sufficient distance from the manor house she dug her heels into the flanks of the horse and fled into the night.</p>
