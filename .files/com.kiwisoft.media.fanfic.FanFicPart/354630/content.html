<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 15 -->

<p>David turned to Xander, fear large in both their eyes.</p>

<p>"Armoury. Match Head rounds. 13-19-01. Go! Now!" said David. Xander
dashed off in the direction of the armoury. David then turned to Willow.</p>

<p>"You know any attack spells? You know, fire, lightning, blow the big
ugly monster to bits kind?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I need to get the right ingredients and look in the right
books." she informed him.</p>

<p>"No time." David told her. He finally looked at Giles.</p>

<p>"OK. If this thing gets past me, you need to get out of here. You,
Xander, and Willow need to find Buffy. Then drive to March Air Force Base.
When you get there..." Giles interrupted David.</p>

<p>"You're not going to fight this..." Giles began.</p>

<p>"DAD! Shut the fuck up and listen! When you get to the main gate, tell
the guards the code word is 'Jericho'. The air movements officer will arrive
and tell him the code word is 'Cotton Tail'. They will then fly you to
Amberley Air Force Base in Australia. Once there, call Albert and he will
take care of things after that." Giles nodded reluctantly. Xander returned
with a shotgun in one hand and an uzi in the other. David took the uzi.</p>

<p>"Protect them." David said indicating to Giles and Willow. " Dad will
fill you in on the rest."</p>

<p>"Dad?" Xander asked puzzled, but David had walked out into the garden.</p>

<p>The Jachyra looked at David as he strolled out into the garden. It
gave a hideous, demented howl of near delight. It was the kind of sound that
made people's blood run cold. David was no exception. David cocked the weapon
then opened fire on the Jachyra, empting the entire clip.</p>

<p>The Jachyra became a brilliant pillar of fire, howling and rolling on
the grass. The fires died out. To David's horror the Jachyra, horribly burnt
and smoking, leapt to its feet. It let loose a howl of pain and delight then
kicked David through the glass windows of the gym/training room where Willow,
Giles and Xander stood. David slid across the floor and laid unmoving. The
Jachyra jumped into the room.</p>

<p>"HEY!" a voice yelled. It was Buffy with Spike beside her. Buffy took
a flying leap at the Jachyra, kicking it in the head. The Jachyra merely
shrugged off the blow and back handed Buffy, sending her flying into the
wall, dazed and unable to move. The Jachyra advanced toward Buffy.</p>

<p>Xander swore in frustration. Match head rounds didn't work on this
creature and he couldn't take the shot at it for fear of hitting Buffy. A
growl and a blonde blur signalled Spikes attack.</p>

<p>The blonde vampire tackled the Jachyra with a tackle that would have
made a rugby coach proud. Spike sat on top of the Jachyra and began to punch
it.</p>

<p>"NOBODY!" Punch! </p>

<p>"KILLS!" Punch! </p>

<p>"MY!" Punch! </p>

<p>"FRIENDS!". The Jachyra caught Spike's arm and, to the horror of
everybody, ripped it off and struck Spike in the head with the arm. Spike lay
unconscious on the floor. The Jachyra got up and began to move towards Buffy
again. Before it could reach her, a set of hands grabbed the Jachyra around
the head. David.</p>

<p>Blue-white spirit fire burst from his hands, enveloping its head. The
Jachyra gave a howl of pain before the spirit fire exploded down its body and
reduced it to ashes. David fell to the ground, his energy gone and unable to
stand. Giles, Willow, and Xander rushed over. Giles went to David.</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" Giles asked his son.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll be OK. Spirit Fire uses a lot of magic and strength. I
just need to rest for a bit. Go help Buffy and Spike." mumbled David. The
last thing he saw before he passed out was Willow helping Buffy stand and
Giles and Xander tending to Spike's wounds.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>David awoke a little over an hour later. He was laying in his bed and
Giles sat in a chair beside him. Seeing that he was awake Giles came over to
David.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" he asked. David smiled.</p>

<p>"Fine. How's Buffy and Spike?" asked David.</p>

<p>"Other than a bump to the head and a few bruises, she will be fine.
Spike, well, we bandaged his stump and have given him some pain killers. We
will keep a good supply of blood to him and hope his vampire healing
abilities will be able to handle it." Giles and David looked up when Buffy,
Willow and Xander entered the room.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy. I like the bump." David said, indicating to the big lump
on her forehead.</p>

<p>"Well, normally I leave the getting bumped on the head thing to your
father." she said as she came to stand beside Giles.</p>

<p>"I guess you want an explanation." David said, referring to the fact
that Giles was his father.</p>

<p>"No need. I explained it to them." Giles informed his son.</p>

<p>"And? How they take it?" asked David. Buffy answered for Giles.</p>

<p>"I'm too busy wigging out about that red demon. Once I'm done with
that, then I'll start wigging out about you and Giles." Buffy grew silent for
a moment. "That thing, was it the thing that cast that spell on me and
Willow?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. The Jachyra is a killing demon. I'm pretty sure it was the
Jachyra that killed the Initiative. It is a creature of great magic in the
fact that it takes great magic to bring into this world. I guess only magic
could kill it. So, no. But whoever or whatever raised the Jachyra is probably
the same person that cast the spell. Tonight we are going to find out who or
what did this." David said.</p>

<p>"We?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Tonight Xander and I are going to talk to the Dreamtime
Spirits." said David.</p>
