<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty-One: A Battle Plan -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Parking lot***</p>
<p>Nicole sat in her luxury car and thought. She had the perfect
information to hurt not only Faith but Spam too! But she didn't know
how to use it. She had tried the flyer thing before when she found
out about Carmen's mother being a drunk, so that was out. So her
problem was how to you go about telling a mass of people something,
where they knew it was you who did it, but yet had no proof that it
was. And this was her problem.</p>
<p>Tapping her steering wheel impatiently she let her eyes unfocuss and
look inward. She knew the answer had to be in her diabolical mind
somewhere. Two people walked behind Nicole's car, since her window
was down she caught part of their conversation.</p>
<p>"No way!"</p>
<p>"No I'm telling you it's true, I saw it on the net on this really
cool website, he's totally."</p>
<p>The rest of the conversation was lost on her, she had it! The
Internet! You want to let large sums of people (like the population
of Kennedy High) you post it on the net, someone will find it, pass
it on, and before you know it, everyone knows. And of course it just
has to be true, it was on the net. Nicole smiled one of her most
evil smiled and set her brain to thinking about what computer nerds
she could make put the info out. Starting the car she drove off,
with a plan in hand.</p>
