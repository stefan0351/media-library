<P>a/n: yess, I decided…it'll be alternating Miley and Lilly. For now.</P><P>Chapter Two: It's All Right Here</P><P>This girl, Lilly, who was sitting in front of me as we rode on old Bluejeans back to the stables, she was just amazing from what I could tell. Outer looks as well as what I can see from her personality. Quiet, shy, and just quite a bit curious seeming. 'She is darn cute.' I thought, smiling to myself. Slowly she began to relax in front of me, as we weren't talking just riding in silence, and I think she fell asleep because her head fell softly back on top my shoulder. I sighed, and then tried not to sneeze when her hair tickled my nose. I reached up, with my hand that wasn't holding the reins to Bluejeans, and smoothed her hair down. 'Oh wow…her hair is soft!' Quickly I jerked my hand down and put in an appropriate place so I wouldn't feel tempted to touch her again. She must be tired from walking these dumb hills…</P><P>Several minutes later I slumped over slightly onto Lilly, falling into a light sleep, knowing Bluejeans knew the way home.</P><P>"Neigh Neigh," I heard…it sounded far off…but I awoke anyways and saw it was just Bluejeans in his stall eating hay calmly as Lilly and I slept on his back.</P><P>"Oh crap!" I yelled, hoping off him, "Oh Blue boy, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have fallen asleep, how long have you been home?" I glanced out of his stall door and saw it was pitch black outside except for the old lamp post on the path here. "Shit it must be like midnight boy, I'm sorry." I shook Lilly's arm, "Hey, wake up." She was now slumped forward onto Bluejeans, still sleeping soundly…even through my cursing and jumping around. "Wake up, Lilly! We're home…or I'm home, you're just visiting." Bluejeans glanced at me like I was stupid, "Well I don't know what she calls this place Blue so don't look at me like that. Now Lilly! Wake up!" I tugged a strand of her hair, "Oh Lillian…" I muttered.</P><P>Then suddenly she sat straight up, "Don't call me Lillian! I hate that."</P><P>I grinned, "Sorry kid, now jump down off Bluejeans he's been standing here hot and sweaty while we slept on him." I held my arms out to catch her as she slid her leg over to slide off him. "Jump, it's not that bad." She jumped, and stepped in a fresh horse patty, but I caught her around the hips so she didn't fall face forward into any more. "Sorry 'bout that." I mumbled.</P><P>"Uh, well…it's okay." She tried to shake the poop off her shoe…but only succeeded in slinging it everywhere.</P><P>"You should wear boots next time. Then it doesn't matter if you get poop on 'em." I glanced down at my own pair I was wearing…then wished I had said that, since these were indeed covered in horse poop…or cow poop, who knows. "But there's a uh hose around the side of the stables if yah want to wash that off before it dries."</P><P>She nodded as she walked out of the stable; she had also been looking at my gross boots also. I hoped she wasn't disgusted by them…I just didn't care about these boots; normally I am a pretty clean kid.</P><P>I set to taking the saddle and other gear off of Bluejeans, then got to work brushing him down…it was the least I could do since it was too late to bother with washing him down in the wash racks. He hadn't been running or anything back to the barn anyways, and it was pretty cool out lately. I patted him on the muzzle, and went to get his feed from the feed room, but stopping to get Lilly from the wash racks where she was washing her shoe off first. "Lilly, I'm going to get feed for Bluejeans, you want to come?"</P><P>"Uh," She glanced up as she turned the water hose off, "I guess so…can you walk me back to the bed and breakfast after that? I don't know where it is…"</P><P>"Oh, if you follow the lamp over there," I pointed out into the darkness to the lamp, "You'll see the bed and breakfast right up past the lamp."</P><P>Her eyes got wide, and she mumbled, "I hate the dark."</P><P>"You hate the…" I trailed off not wanting to offend her, but I couldn't help but chuckle at what she said. "Alright well, come with me to get the feed and I'll walk you back to the bed and break fast." I headed off towards the feed room, grabbing a bucket from the tack room on my way.</P><P>"What's he eat? I thought horses just ate hay." She walked quickly to keep up with my slightly longer strides.</P><P>"Well, he eats…his feed we buy, and hay. Sometimes apples when he's being a good boy, which is usually." I smiled at her, trying to slow my pace so she could keep up easier.</P><P>"Do you like animals a lot?"</P><P>"Love 'em, mostly horses though…and cats. I've got a kitty at home, he's a sweetie too. You should meet him." Then I thought, 'I hoped somebody fed him for me or I'd have a mad kitty when I got home finally…'</P><P>"Aw, cute. What's his name?"</P><P>"Cat."</P><P>"Oh, uh," She looked at me like, 'Are you serious?' "That's cute."</P><P>"I'm not very good at naming things," I laughed. "I tried to name Bluejeans 'Horse' but my daddy said, 'Oh no Miles you name this horse 'Horse' and I'm calling you 'Girl' from now on! We've already got poor Cat at home…and 'Bird' the bird dog!'"</P><P>Lilly laughed at that, "Oh, well…that's understandable, I had a cat named Pig once…and not cause he was fat, I just told my mom I wanted a pig, but she got me a cat and said it was a pig."</P><P>I grinned at her, and pulled the feed door open walking inside I opened one of the many trashcans in the room and measured out four scoops of feed for Bluejeans into the bucket.</P><P>"Wow, he eats a lot."</P><P>I shrugged, "I guess so, some of them eat more than him even…but I guess you get use to it after working with horses for most of your life."</P><P>"That's a ton of food." She stated again.</P><P>I just smiled, holding the door open for her. "If you say so; Cat thinks he's a horse and will try to eat this much at one sitting if we don't hide the cat food bag from him."</P><P>Lilly laughed again. "He sounds cute."</P><P>'You're cute.' I said cockily inside my head, loving her laugh. We walked quietly for the most part back to BlueJeans' pen to feed him, and I threw in some more hay for him to eat. "'Night Bluejeans, see you in the mornin'." I yawned, "C'mon Lil, we'll get you over to the bed and breakfast…dang I could use a bed right now too." Then I got a whiff of myself, and scrunched my nose, "Dang and maybe a shower too!"</P><P>Lilly laughed quietly, peering out into the darkness around the path.</P><P>"C'mon," I grabbed her hand…without thinking, and pulled her beside me as I walked her back to the bed and breakfast. "Here we are," I let go of her hand, just then realizing I had been holding it all the while. "Sorry," I mumbled incoherently. "G'night Lilly, maybe go out to the stables tomorrow if you get bored around here…if you're going to be here tomorrow still?"</P><P>Her face was slightly flushed as she replied, "I'll be here awhile Miley. Goodnight."</P>
