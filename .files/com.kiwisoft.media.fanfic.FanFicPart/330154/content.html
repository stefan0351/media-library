<!-- Sleeping Beauty Awakes (Or Waking Up Is Hard To Do) -->

<p>Brooke returned to Sam's bedside later that day and continued her
normal pattern until finals passed and summer arrived.  Sam's
injuries were healing nicely but she was making no progress towards
waking up.  Everyone was getting discouraged but Brooke was
unswayed.  She knew Sam was in there somewhere, trying to make up her
mind whether or not to come home, and Brooke was determined to be
patient.  She continued her daily routine, much to the minor distress
to her parents who feared for her health but she seemed to be fine
and the hospital staff was looking out for her.</p>

<p>"Guess what Sam?  Mom talked to the school board and they said your
grades were good enough that when you wake up, you can make up the
work you've missed over the summer and if you pass your make-up
finals, you could be a senoir with the rest of us in the fall.  Isn't
that great?" she asked as she gently brushed a knot out of Sam's
hair.  She listened to the blip of the heart monitor and took it as a
positive response.  At least Sam had been breathing on her own for a
while, that was a good sign.  </p>

<p>Brooke had finished with her administrations to Sam's hair and was
packing up the brushes when she saw it.  The faintest of stirrings in
Sam's left hand.  For a minute she thought she'd imagined it but
there it was again.  Sam's finger's were curling and it didn't strike
Brooke as the same unconscious muscle twitches that had falsely
raised her hoped is days past.  It was like Sam was reaching for
something.  It clicked in Brooke's mind that it was the hand she
usually held.  Sam was reaching out for her.  Brooke hastily put the
brushes down and reached for the hand.</p>

<p>"Sam, Sammy can you hear me?" she asked as she pressed the call
button beside Sam's head.  After a second or two, she felt a very
light squeeze on her hand and nearly yelled with joy.  Wanting to
make sure she wasn't imagining things, Brooke asked Sam again.</p>

<p>"Sam, if you can hear me and understand me, squeeze me hand twice."
She waited.  One squeeze was followed a few seconds later by another
one, this time a little stronger.  Tears of relief began to stream
down Brooke's face as a nurse entered the room.</p>

<p>"What is it, Brooke?" Nurse Carolyn Prant asked when she saw Brooke
crying.</p>

<p>"She's coming around.  She squeezed my hand," Brooke told her.
Carolyn looked at her dubiously.  She'd been watching Brooke take
loving care of the comatose girl for the entire time now and was sure
Brooke was imagining things.  Brooke sighed.  "I am not imagining
it.  Come see for yourself." Carolyn walked over to where Brooke was
while Brooke spoke softly into Sam's ear again.</p>

<p>"Hey, Sam.  I know you're in there, don't make a liar out of me.
Squeeze my hand twice if you can hear me," she asked.  Carolyn
watched as the thin pale hand in Brooke's contracted once and then
again.  She nearly screamed herself when she realized Brooke was
right.</p>

<p>"This is fantastic!  I'll get the doctor and call your parents right
away!" Carolyn ran out to get Sam's doctor and left Brooke with Sam.</p>

<p>"That's a girl, Sam.  I knew you could do it.  Thank you," she
started to weep as Sam squeezed her hand again and this time didn't
let go.</p>

<p>Whoever writes in movies and television that coma patients suddenly
wake up and immediately recognize the people around them is full of
shit.  That's what Brooke would tell you if you asked.  It was
another three days before Sam was awake and another two before she
was truly aware of her surroundings.  Everyone was overjoyed to see
her awake and responding but it wasn't long before they realized
something was wrong.</p>

<p>"Doctor, why can't she speak?" Jane asked, afraid for her normally
verbose daughter who was quickly becoming frustrated by her inability
to communicate a few days later.  Dr. Parker frowned.  </p>

<p>"I don't think it's anything permanent.  I had a neurologist go over
her test results and he concurs.  The skull fracture was near the
area of the brain associated with speech. The brain isn't a
regenerating organ, it can't heal damage but all our scans don't show
any evidence of an actual injury or stroke.  She suffered an injury
to the brain, however minor that resulted in a prolonged state of
unconsciousness and it's normal for there to be side effects from
that."</p>

<p>"Dr. Ormanji, the neurologist, and I think it's a temporary
condition, a side effect that will eventually go away once the brain
has time to straighten itself out.  A lot has happened to Sam, she's
going to need a long time to heal.  I can't give you any guarantees,
of course, but I've already called in a speech pathologist to work
with her and help her over the hump.  The fact that her arm is still
in a brace will undoubtedly make it harder for her as she can't
write."</p>

<p>"Well, Brooke's bringing her her laptop tomorrow so she can type
some, but you're saying this isn't permanent?" Jane asked hopefully
as she and the doctor talked outside Sam's door.  Any small bit of
good news she could get she was going to grab on to.</p>

<p>"By all indications, no," Dr. Parker told her cheerfully.  And he was
more than happy to give any positive news he could.  Sam was quickly
becoming known as the Miracle Patient of Ward 4.  "I would, however
encourage her to speak as much as possible.  I realize she's
reluctant to given that she's uncomfortable with the stuttering and
slight aphasia but the only way to get past this is through it."</p>

<p>"I understand, thank God for good news.  What about her legs?"</p>

<p>"Tests results we're getting back now are cause for us to be
cautiously optimistic at this point, Jane.  The damage isn't as
extensive as we originally thought and the swelling is already
beginning to lessen.  She's all ready regained some feeling, if not
movement in her legs.  That is a good sign.  She is, however, looking
at some heavy-duty physical therapy to get back to the level she once
was at, especially considering the nature of the damage done.  And
that is, of course, best case scenario.  A lot of it has to do with
how hard Sam is willing to work."</p>
