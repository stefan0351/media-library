<P><B>so it's been a while, i know. but my school is weird and now i have a 5 day weekend for no reason, so i have writing time! oh, and guess what! i got seasons 1 & 2 of South of Nowhere for xmas, and i ordered season 3 online yesterday! for those of you who don't know that show, you need to discover it. it's amazingly epic. and awesomeeee!</B></P><P>I was the one to break the kiss, taking a few steps back. Lilly just stayed stationary, watching me, I'm guessing trying to guage my reaction.</P><P>"I'm sorry...I shouldn't have done that," she said, leaning against the edge of the desk.</P><P>"No...It's fine...I...I kissed you back, anyway." I don't know why, but I couldn't manage to look her in the eye. I could only feel her intense gaze on me. It's the one she uses when she really wants to figure someone out. It kinda feels like she's staring directly into your soul.</P><P>"Miley-" She took a step closer to me and I took three steps back.</P><P>"No, let's just...let's just keep a safe distance between us until we figure this out." I crossed the room, walking backwards, and landed sitting on the edge of the bed.</P><P>She smirked at me. "Why, am I just that irresistable?"</P><P>"Oh my god," I sighed, leaning back to grab a pillow and throw it at her, "conceited much?"</P><P>"No, never!"</P><P>We both smiled and laughed lightly, avoiding the subject at hand. But when the laughter died out, and our smiles faded, I knew we had to talk about it. "Look," I started, "I'm sure Oliver has already told you all about my self-discovery or whatever-"</P><P>"Wait, what?"</P><P>Confusion crossed both of our faces. "I assumed Oliver would've told you. He's got a big mouth."</P><P>"Well he didn't tell me anything about you..." The conversation took a long pause, before the inevitable question. "Miley, are you gay?"</P><P>"No, I just have a habit of kissing all my step-sisters." I gave her a Look. "I've been thinking about it for a while now. Overanalyzing, just like you and Oliver did."</P><P>"Hence the asking Oliver how he knew he was gay."</P><P>"Yeahhh..."</P><P>The conversation trailed off again, until she picked it right back up again. "Why didn't you just tell me? I could have helped you this entire time."</P><P>"Because I've been in denial about it this entire time. I didn't even want to admit it to myself, much less you."</P><P>"Why?"</P><P>"I don't know!" I fell back onto the bed, lying down with my legs still bent at the knee on the edge, the lower halves dangling. "It's not exactly something you just accept right away!"</P><P>She sighed, then got up, and I heard her footsteps across the floor, coming towards me. I felt her lay down on the bed beside me, same way I was laying, and rolled my head over to face her. "I know," she replied quietly, "I know how hard the whole thing is. Which is why you should've just talked to me."</P><P>"I know."</P><P>We both fell quiet, just gazing at each other. "So what's the verdict?" Lilly asked, bringing her hand up to softly tuck my hair behind my ear.</P><P>I sighed before answering with a smirk. "I guess I'm just another Lesbo Lilly."</P><P>A slow smile crept across her face. "Hey, that's my name."</P><P>"No way." I smiled back, then leaned in for another kiss.</P><P>This one was much more intimate. It was soft and sensual, so unlike any kiss I'd ever shared with any guy. I could feel in the way that her hand held my face that she actually genuinely cared about me. Which is strange, because now I was kinda getting the message that she had had a crush on me all along, and just never said it. But I guess it's not too strange, considering the sex dream she had about me, which was a pretty tell-tale sign of a crush. I had one of her too, though. I've had a crush on her this entire time, and not known it? How is that possible?</P><P>Lilly broke the kiss this time. She sat up, looking down at me. "What?"</P><P>I followed suit and straightened (haha) up. "What what?"</P><P>"Your mind wandered somewhere else. Where are you? Don't tell me that was just your little lesbian experiment and now you're going back to your perfect little straight girl world 'cause I've had enough of that and-" She looked worried for a second, like she thought I'd changed my mind. My face broke into a smile.</P><P>"Whoa, Lilly, calm down. I was just thinking about you," I returned, then pressed my lips on hers again.</P><P>Neither of us broke the kiss that time.</P><P>...</P><P>So yesterday, Sunday, Lilly and I stayed in our room all day, laying in bed together, having a <I>South of Nowhere </I>marathon, since she owns all three seasons. We didn't get to finish the whole series, but it was fun nonetheless. We ate popcorn and candy and drank sodas, basically gaining like 3 pounds each. During the episodes we would sometimes start asking each other random questions, getting to know each other better. If I was an outsider looking in, watching my life ever since Lilly got here, I would think that I was a totally different person. Since when do I sit at home and watch <I>South of Nowhere</I> and giggle and have popcorn throwing fights where pieces fall down my shirt and my step-sister pulls them out with her teeth? I am not this girl. Or, at least, I didn't used to be. She's changed me. In other ways, too.</P><P>This morning, as I got ready for school, I dressed like a...a...normal person. I put on blue jeans and tank top. Granted, the blue jeans were a very dark blue, and the tank top was black, but still. Radical changes were happening. I even put on converse, instead of my combat boots. What the fuck was happening to me?</P><P>Oliver's voice dragged me out of my thoughts and back to the present as he climbed into the backseat, ready for school. "So, my lovely ladies, what did you two do yesterday? After you guys got home from the rally it was as if you fell off the face of the planet. I called and texted and neither of you answered. Don't tell me you're making a new No Boys Allowed club."</P><P>"Even if we were, you wouldn't have a problem getting in," I teased, catching his eye in the sideview mirror.</P><P>"Hey!"</P><P>"She has a point, Oliver. Look at what you're wearing today," Lilly stated.</P><P>At a red light, Lilly and I turned to review Oliver's outfit: white capri's, a baby blue polo, and flip-flops that matched. Along with the bangles on his arm, two of every color of the rainbow, in order. He just can't hide that gay pride.</P><P>"Okay, fine. But Robert doesn't seem to have a problem with the way I dress."</P><P>Lilly and I exchanged glances, then burst out simultaneously in girly sighs. "Oh, Robbiepoo!"</P><P>"Hey, shut up!"</P><P>"Olliepop and Robbiepoo! How cute!" Lilly exclaimed.</P><P>"I mean it, cut it out!"</P><P>"Oh, Robbipoo, you football stud, you can play with my balls anytime!" I squealed.</P><P>"Guys, come on, shut the fuck up!"</P><P>Lilly and I slowly decreased our laughter until we were both quiet again. I turned around to find Oliver pouting in the backseat.</P><P>"Oliver, come on, you know we were just playing with you," I offered.</P><P>Lilly added, "Yeah, it was just a joke."</P><P>"Well, it's not much of a joke unless all parties are laughing," he huffed.</P><P>I shared a look with my step-sister and we both said, "Sorry, Oliver."</P><P>"Yeah, whatever. You two A.D.D clowns managed to evade my question, but don't think I forgot. What were you guys doing this weekend?"</P><P>Silence filled the car when neither Lilly nor I answered. We'd talked about it yesterday, vaguely, but hadn't decided whether we were official yet, or if we were going to tell people, including Oliver, or if we were even gonna acknowledge what was happening between us.</P><P>"No way!" Oliver breathed, sticking his head in between our two seats. "Did you two finally?...Did Miley figure it out?...Are you two-"</P><P>"Stop right there, Oliver. We plead the fifth," Lilly finally said.</P><P>"Only the guilty plead the fifth! You two so are! When? How!"</P><P>"Keep asking questions, Lance Bass, and we'll have to plead the fifth in the trial for your murder," I threatened.</P><P>He smirked and relaxed back in his seat. "Alright, whatever...But I think everyone in this car knows the truth."</P><P>A few minutes of silence later, we reached the parking lot and I shot out of the car first, hurrying away from all that. Lilly called after me, sounding hurt, but hard as it was I kept walking. I couldn't deal with this right now. Everything was fine yesterday when no one was hounding us about it. Dad and Heather went away to some pre-wedding retreat. Their nuptials are set for Valentine's Day (how overly cheesy), which is a mere 4 months away. So there was no one to bother us yesterday. But now? I've got Oliver already all over my ass, and no doubt the school will be following shortly after. They've already been watching how often I've been hanging out with Oliver and Lilly. What will they do if they see Lilly and I <I>together </I>together?</P><P>Time. That's what I need. I'll take this day off and go hang out all day at the Starbucks a couple blocks away. I need to process this.</P><P>...</P><P>I'd only been at the Starbucks for 10 minutes, enjoying the peaceful environment, when a group of girls in athletic uniforms stampeded into the place, being all rowdy and annoying as hell. From the looks of it, I'd say they were all in my grade, probably a basketball team, and all very attractive. The whole lot of them went to stand in line, as if lines as Starbucks weren't already long enough on a daily basis. I could tell the staff didn't know whether to be happy about all the money they'd just made or disgruntled at all the noise they were making. Fifteen minutes later, when they'd all ordered drinks and received them at the waiting counter, they all shuffled over and took up a million of the little two-person tables all over the place. One girl looked around and noticed the all the chairs were taken, except for the one opposite me at my table. I closed my eyes and pleaded with whatever higher powers might be in the sky.</P><P><I>Please don't let her walk over here. Please don't let her walk over here. Please don't let her-</I></P><P>"Hey, do you mind if I sit here?" she asked, gesturing to the damned chair across from me.</P><P>"No, of course not," I spat.</P><P>She looked a little offended but sat down regardless. "So, what crawled up your ass and died?"</P><P>I could not believe she'd just said that to me. Who did she think she is? "Excuse you?"</P><P>"You heard me."</P><P>"Well, gee, Molly Manners, I dunno. Maybe I'm irritated because a group of loud annoying girls just paraded through that door, completely disrupting my thoughts."</P><P>"Man, that must suck. Sorry 'bout your luck."</P><P>"Thanks, Rhyming Rhonda. I appreciate that <I>oh </I>so much."</P><P>She frowned at me and I could tell she was not happy. "Look, I'm sorry our team came in at a time that was inconvenient for you. We'll try to schedule our drink stops at more appropriate times that fit into your schedule from now on."</P><P>"Oh, I would just be <I>so </I>grateful."</P><P>"Yeah, no problem."</P><P>I rolled my eyes. "Whatever.</P><P>Then, she chuckled. Yes, you read correctly. She <I>chuckled.</I> "What the hell is so funny?"</P><P>She just shook her head. "Nothin'. My ex used to say that all the time."</P><P>"He sounds pretty gay."</P><P>"Yeah, <I>she</I> was."</P><P>I stopped all thoughts and had to re-boot my brain. "She?"</P><P>"Yeah, she. Or at least, I hope she was gay, or else what was she doing dating me?"</P><P>This whole conversation had taken a very unexpected turn. "Right."</P><P>"What? Don't tell me you're homophobic."</P><P>I snorted. "Pft, yeah, that's it. I'm a total homophobe. That's why I skipped school today to get away from my step-sister who I've inadvertantly developed feelings for, therefore having to question everything about my life and who I am."</P><P>"Ah, so that's what's bothering you."</P><P>I took the lid off my cup and stirred the coffee with one of those tiny black straws. "Yeah," I said, intent on watching the swirl of the liquid, "that's what's bothering me."</P><P>"Well, I can't give you much advice. My ex, now <I>she'd </I>be great at helping you out. She's always giving advice to people."</P><P>"The one that always says Whatever?"</P><P>"Yeah, her."</P><P>"Oh. Too bad she's not here."</P><P>"Yep. Looks like you're just stuck with me." Just then all her teammates got up from their tables and started hustling back out. They called out to her, beckoning her to go with them. "Actually, it seems like you're not."</P><P>"Seems like it."</P><P>She rose from the table, heading for the door, then stopped and turned to look back at me. "Hey. It sounds like what you need to do is the opposite of what you're doing right now. Avoiding her is probably not going to help the situation any. You should go back to school, talk to her. These types of things never sort themselves out. And judging by how upset you are, I'd guage that she means a lot to you. So, my advice is just to discuss this whole thing with her. My Whatever Ex was always saying how the key to relationships is communication. Relationship or not, it sounds like that's what the two of you need."</P><P>"Thanks," I replied, "I'll try that. I'm Miley, by the way."</P><P>She smiled. "I'm Kayla. See you around."</P><P>With that, she strolled out the door and caught up with her team, leaving me alone to think about what she'd just told me.</P><P>Wait, what was I doing? She told me to go talk to Lilly. So what was I still doing here? I quickly slapped the lid back on my coffee cup and sprinted out the door, headed down the street towards school. I'd only missed first period, maybe part of second, too. I could still make it back in time for third, which left me plenty of time to think before lunch when I would talk to her. I had to talk to her. Kayla was right, Lilly does mean a lot to me. I don't know how it happened, I don't know why it happened, I don't even know when it happened, but it did. Lilly was slowly consuming my life...Shit.</P><P><B>alright, so there it is! reviews would me most appreciated. whether you loved it or hated it, i always love to hear from you guys. :)</B></P>
