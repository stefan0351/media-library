<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Nineteen -->

<p>Much to Brooke?s relief, the Rescue Squad arrived a few hours later. Carmen and the others had reached them and practically dragged them back by the hair. They immediately wrapped Sam up on a stretcher and whisked her away to the nearest medical center with Brooke in tow.</p>
<p>Sam was in and out of consciousness the entire time, calling out for Brooke in her confusion. Nicole had quietly faded to the background when she heard Sam call for Brooke in her delirious state. There was no denying where Sam?s heart truly lay now that she called out for the taller blonde in her time of need. Nicole and Mary Cherry headed to the airport to board a private flight home without a good-bye to anyone although Mary Cherry did let Lily know that they were leaving.</p>
<p>"Nic, are y?all ser this is what ya wanna do?" Mary Cherry asked her silent companion in the taxi back to the airport. She heard Nicole sigh as the other girl stared blankly out the window.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I?m certainly not wanted here. You?re welcome to stay Mary Cherry, I don?t care," she said flatly trying to keep control of her turbulent emotions.</p>
<p>"Ah?d just assume go home wit? y?all now, Nic," Mary Cherry said. "So, what?s yer plan when we git home?" Nicole tore her gaze from the window and focused on the Southern belle.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked confused. Mary Cherry?s eyes had a somewhat maniacal gleam.</p>
<p>"What are ya plannin? ta do ta Spam and Brookie when they git home? What nefarious plot are y?all hatchin??" Nicole ground her teeth together and clenched her eyes shut.</p>
<p>"Just forget about it, Mary Cherry. I?m not going to do anything," she declared.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Mary Cherry screeched surprised.</p>
<p>"There will be no revenge, I will wreak no vengeance on the unsuspecting. It?s not worth it. Besides, Sam could be really sick. I think that?s punishment enough." Mary Cherry was quiet for several minutes as she thought this over.</p>
<p>"You actually fell for her didn?t you?" she finally asked Nicole quietly. Again Nicole sighed and this time the tears she had been trying so hard to fight won out and slipped down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. Damn me to Hell, I did."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>At the hospital, they discovered that Sam was slightly dehydrated and had minor frostbite on her ears, nose, fingers, and toes although Brooke?s limited knowledge had been enough to prevent permanent damage. She also had a concussion from when she hit her head, which contributed to her unconsciousness and confusion during her brief periods of awareness. What concerned the doctors now that she was out of danger from hypothermia, was the congestion in her lungs and the fever that raged within her.</p>
<p>Jane and Mike were on their way from California and expected to arrive in the morning after being informed by Lily and Josh of everything that had happened. They were upset but proud of the way Brooke had handled everything. Now Brooke sat exhausted by Sam?s bedside holding the girl?s sweaty hand. She was mindful of the wires monitoring Sam?s condition and the nasal tubes helping Sam get oxygen.</p>
<p>"Time to wake up, Sam. You?re sleeping through your vacation," she teased weakly. Her own voice was nothing but a raspy whisper; she was so beyond her own limits of endurance. She only wanted Sam to wake up and smile at her; she?d give anything to see that simple thing. A harsh, racking cough ripped through Sam making Brooke wince in sympathy.</p>
<p>"God, Sammy, that sounds terrible," she sighed.</p>
<p>"Feels awful too," Sam gasped softly. Brooke smiled and sat up to look at Sam?s glassy but open and aware brown eyes.</p>
<p>"Hello, sleepy-head," she greeted Sam who smiled weakly back. "Welcome back."</p>
<p>"Hey," Sam said in return. Brooke reached out to stroke Sam?s forehead and get her bangs out of her eyes. Sam sighed and closed her eyes at the contact, a gesture not lost on Brooke.</p>
<p>"How you feeling?" Brooke asked. Sam opened her eyes again and tried to focus on Brooke but her vision was slightly blurry. So she looked at the blonde blur in front of her and let Brooke?s welcome and adored voice wash over her and comfort her.</p>
<p>"I?m not cold," she said with a half-hearted smirk. She laughed a little but it quickly turned into a hard coughing fit that left her breathless.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" Brooke asked worriedly. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she rasped past the pain in her throat and lungs. "Tired though," she yawned. "And I ruined your vacation." Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"No you didn?t, Sam," Brooke argued. "I had a good time because you made it enjoyable. This mess is Nicole?s fault. I?m just glad you?re all right. Besides, it was supposed to be YOUR vacation." Sam smiled and yawned again. The pull of sleep was beginning to be too much for her to fight much longer. </p>
<p>"I?m glad you were having fun," she said, her voice fading near the end as her eyes dropped. Brooke grinned and caressed Sam?s cheek with her fingertips.</p>
<p>"I was. And there?s no one else I?d rather have spent the time with," she confessed. "Rest, Sam, and get better. We?ll try the vacation thing again, this time without Nicole and her surprises, I promise." Sam nodded and seemed to drift off. Brooke laid her head down on the bed and started to drift off herself when she heard Sam?s voice again, so soft she almost missed it.</p>
<p>"I heard you," Sam whispered. "And I love you too." Brooke smiled and fell asleep blissfully happy.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"She has pneumonia," Doctor Libby explained to Mike and Jane upon their arrival at the hospital. "It?s not unusual in cases like this and she seems to be fighting it pretty well. We?ve started her on a protocol of antibiotics and she?s holding her own. Now we just have to wait." She pushed open the door to Sam?s room to find both Sam and Brooke asleep on the bed, curled up together like a pair of kittens.</p>
<p>"She hasn?t left her side since they arrived here yesterday," the tall blonde doctor said with a small smile. She looked at the two teens and then back at their parents. "From what the Ski Patrol tells me, you have Brooke to thank for helping save Sam?s life. She re-warmed Sam and kept her hydrated. She did everything right."</p>
<p>"As for Sam?s other injuries, the concussion is healing nicely, as is the frostbite. Providing she doesn?t get any worse with the pneumonia, she should be able to go home in maybe a week," Dr. Libby reassured the worried parents. "She?s a very lucky young lady. That was one heck of a sudden storm."</p>
<p>"So we heard from their friends," Jane said quietly trying not to disturb the sleeping duo.</p>
<p>"Let?s let them sleep," Mike suggested. "They?ve been through a lot."</p>
