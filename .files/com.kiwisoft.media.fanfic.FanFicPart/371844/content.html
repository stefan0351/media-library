<p>Ya'll. I went back and revised this like I said I would. I like it WAY better and to those of you that are interested in what goes on near the end, I edited that part too. Those who don't? I guess I'd skip it if I were you. But really, the other version is 2,904 words and this one is over 5,000 words. Read and please let me know what you think, yeah?</p>

<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;"><b>"Hoedown Throwdown"</b></p>
<p>Fruity colors painted the Tennessee sky as the sun just began to ascend higher and higher; the warm colors gave way to the light blue of morning. Miley Stewart was wide awake as she stared out the window beside her bed in complete awe at the sight. It had been a long time since Miley witnessed a true Tennessee sunrise, but she had always been quite taken by them, and it was easy for her to fall in love with them all over again.</p>
<p>Curled into her side was her best friend, Lilly Truscott. In the silence of the early morning, Miley could hear her heart hammering against her rib cage at their close proximity. Lilly was the only girl—the only person—who could jumpstart her heart and send it into overdrive. And right now, she wasn't even doing anything besides clutching tightly at the shirt covering Miley's midsection as she slept. Lilly's head was on Miley's left shoulder and her left leg was thrown over Miley's thighs, while Lilly's other hand was squashed between them. Miley's arms were around her waist, settled on her lower back to hold Lilly to her as she had been upon waking, and she refused to move unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Miley was thanking whatever higher power for the chance to be in such a position without any interruptions just around the corner, so to speak; such as the frozen marbles her Grandma Ruby had been especially generous in throwing into bed with them whenever they slept past the rising of the sun. Miley was positive that she still had some time to enjoy this before Ruby would noisily begin cooking breakfast and plot another 'marble-attack', as Lilly called it.</p>
<p>Miley wasn't sure if Lilly could be the victim of another attack for the fifth morning in a row; she had given Miley quite an earful after just the first morning and it hadn't been the last of her blonde friend's ranting. However, it felt wonderful waking up with her arms wrapped around Lilly, surrounded by her warmth, and Miley decided that this feeling was worth waking up early for. Things felt so out-of-sync lately, like something was terribly amiss though she couldn't put her finger on it. But each morning since the start of their summer vacation in Crowley Corners, they woke up tangled together as they'd been while sleeping and the feeling was abated until they broke apart. This was something she could get used to and be totally content, and that was something that didn't surprise Miley.</p>
<p>The silence wasn't going to last much longer, Miley knew. Tearing her eyes from the window as she felt Lilly shift, Miley looked down at the top of her head. The hand gripping Miley's shirt loosened and gently fingers smoothed it down. A jolt of arousal shot through Miley at the admittedly innocent touch.</p>
<p>"Can I wake up like this tomorrow?" Lilly wondered quietly; Miley jumped at the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>"How long have you been awake?" Miley questioned, willing her heart to slow down.</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged, resting her hand flat on Miley's stomach, just beneath the cover of her shirt. "A while. I've been awake long enough to decide that I love watching the sunrise here. It's so beautiful."</p>
<p>Miley smiled and quietly sighed. "It's got nothing on you, Lil," she said honestly.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't say anything. Her fingers slowly moved from Miley's shirt, down her stomach and stopping just as her fingertips slipped under the waistband of her shorts. Miley's breathing quickened and she found herself silently pleading for Lilly to explore further, to dive right in beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Oh, if Lilly were to hear the thoughts running through her head, all of her unspoken desires… Miley had to wonder just what she'd think. This wasn't even the first time Miley had been on the verge of begging for such intimacy with her best friend.</p>
<p>And it had all started with a kiss.</p>
<p>For nearly six months, Miley's dreams have been filled to the brim with scenes of her and Lilly in various intimate positions. The first dream took place shortly after Lilly broke up with her boyfriend and their mutual best friend, Oliver Oken. In the dream, Oliver had merely walked away from Lilly and onto a stage where he began to sing. Lilly, looking heartbroken, had turned to Miley for comfort. Their embrace had stretched on and on until somehow their lips met. The kiss was gentle and soft, everything Miley imagined it would be if those lips were to ever touch hers; the kiss—Lilly—had set her heart on fire. Even now, her soul burned brightly for the girl that remained only her best friend.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't only her heart and soul burning; but also her body that was consumed by searing heat. Her dreams had escalated and grown to be so vivid and intense that she would now occasionally wake in the night of the night; she'd be jolted into consciousness as she was hit with mind-blowing orgasms that left her feeling sticky as her entire body tingled and thrummed in the aftermath. And each time, Miley wondered what it would feel like if her dreams became a reality. There was nothing she wanted to do more than find out.</p>
<p>Miley was somewhat ashamed to admit it, but that was exactly what she was intending to do. Her number on objective during their trip was so seduce Lillian Truscott. One way or another, Lilly would surely be hers by their return to Malibu. And Miley wasn't so sure that her best friend would mind all that much; Lilly's fingertips rubbed circles on her heated skin, moving lower to where her fingers were almost completely covered by the soft fabric. Did Lilly have even the slightest idea of how her touches were affecting her?</p>
<p>"Do you really think I'm beautiful?" Lilly murmured, Miley immediately pulled from her thoughts.</p>
<p>Miley chuckled and started to gently stroke the blonde's back, resting her cheek on the top of Lilly's head. "Of course I do," she confirmed, "and you're totally gorgeous, too."</p>
<p>"That's the same thing." Lilly argued.</p>
<p>"Nope, you're wrong," Miley countered. "If I say you're gorgeous, I'm only saying you're good looking—it's totally superficial. But when I say you're beautiful, I'm talking about more than just your pretty face."</p>
<p>"So… I'm superficial and more than a pretty face? I don't get it," Lilly teased.</p>
<p>Miley didn't answer for a few moments. As her adoration for her best friend grew into something more—into what she recognized as <i>romantic love</i>—so had Lilly's beauty. It wasn't Lilly's looks that drew Miley to her, though that was a part of it. No, Miley found that Lilly's personality had a way of shining through in any situation and <i>that</i> was what Miley had fallen in love with.</p>
<p>"What I'm saying is…" she paused for a moment, "…you're one of the most sarcastic people I've ever met. You actually like sports, you'll eat anything that doesn't eat you first, you know how to pick locks, and—"</p>
<p>"Miley."</p>
<p>"Look, all I'm saying is, it's those things that make you beautiful. You are amazing… but even if you were a horrible person, you'd still be gorgeous." Miley finished quickly, then sighed. "You didn't let me finish, you know. But if you don't want to hear me go on and on about how great you are, then that's your problem…"</p>
<p>Lilly lifted her head and leaned forward to press her lips to Miley's cheek in a lingering kiss. "Thank you," she said and settled back down. "What's your grandma making for breakfast?"</p>
<p>A wide grin split Miley's face. Leave it to Lilly… Who else could be so sweet one moment and think solely about her stomach the next?</p>
<p>Miley dragged her hand down Lilly's back and splayed her fingers over her side. They twitched as her grin lessened into a mischievous smile and without another moment's hesitation, her fingers came to life. They danced over Lilly's side and it didn't take long for the blonde to let out a loud peal of laughter as she squirmed, unable to break out of Miley's embrace. The fingers that slipped into Miley's shorts shot lower as she tried to get away before Lilly withdrew them completely. Miley froze, still feeling Lilly's touch dangerously close to where she wanted her to be.</p>
<p>With Miley in a state of mild shock, it didn't take Lilly very long to escape Miley's grasp. As Lilly shouted in triumph, she straddled Miley and took hold of her wrists, pinning them down above her head. Narrowed eyelids hid most of the blonde's bright blue eyes, but Miley still managed to get lost in them. Miley's was nearly in pain as her heart hammered powerfully in her chest—it was a miracle her heart didn't fail her at this rate or bust through her ribcage.</p>
<p>"Lilly no likey," the blonde growled out playfully, arching her right eyebrow. "I'm feeling generous this morning, so I'm gonna let this slide. Now c'mon. I think I hear your grandma cooking, so we should really get out there. I don't trust her. I think she'd use any excuse to throw those marbles on me."</p>
<p>Lilly released Miley's wrists and straightened up, patting the brunette's cheek fondly; she lingered a bit before sliding off of her. Miley bit her bottom lip to stifle a moan as Lilly unintentionally ground against her center as she moved. Miley dug her fingers into the blankets on either side of her as she watched Lilly get up and gather her clothes for the day.</p>
<p>Miley tore her eyes from her best friend as Lilly's clothes began to make a pile on the floor; instead she focused her eyes on the ceiling above her and tried to ignore the half-naked Lilly only a few feet from her. Her efforts were unsuccessful and she indulged in a small peek. It was never her intention to rake her eyes over her best friend's naked back—over those strong shoulders, her toned back down to the dip of her lower back that gave way to the curve of her butt. It just sort of… happened. Oh, God, it felt so wrong as she shamelessly admired her best friend's figure. What would it be like to feel that beautiful body beneath her? To trace that poodle-shaped birthmark on her left cheek with only the very tips of her fingers? Would Lilly break out into goosebumps as Miley let herself believe?</p>
<p>Beads of sweat began to dot Miley's forehead as Lilly dressed her lower half; they started to drip down the side of her face when Lilly abruptly turned around, her shirt open as she slowly buttoned it.</p>
<p>Miley's eyes fell on the purple bra covering Lilly's chest then rose up to her face. She felt a twinge of embarrassment as Lilly stared intensely back at her; but Miley's resolve to seduce her was only strengthened as she realized Lilly had yet to chastise her for blatantly checking her out.</p>
<p>Lilly's smoldering gaze left hers as Miley sat up and threw her legs over the side of the bed. A plan was forming in her head, becoming solid as she pieced it together.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lil," Miley called out softly, "Did I get to show you my loft last time we were here?"</p>
<p>"Nope," Lilly answered, "We were kind of busy with Hannah, remember?"</p>
<p>Right. Hannah. Miley did remember that. "What do you say we go up there after breakfast?"</p>
<p>The bed dipped next to her and a moment later, Lilly's arms were wrapped around her. Miley patted Lilly's hand affectionately, covering it as she turned her head to kiss the soft cheek next to hers. As the blonde drew back, there was a look of mild surprise on her face. <i>If that was a shocker… oh, Lilly, you just wait.</i> Miley smiled sweetly at her before getting up to grab her robe and head into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Lilly was sprawled out on the bed, her hands interlocked beneath her head when Miley walked back into the bedroom and shut the door behind her. As Miley bent over her suitcase to pick out a simple outfit, she felt a pair of eyes on her. Straightening herself, she took a quick glance over her shoulder and briefly met Lilly's eyes. Turning back around, she smirked and dropped her robe to the floor, taking her sweet time as she dressed herself. It was nearly a reverse striptease as she pulled her denim jeans up her legs, then slipped her arms through her plaid shirt. She faced Lilly and started buttoning them from the bottom up. Lilly had yet to tear her hazy eyes away, her gaze definitely not on her face. Lilly suddenly locked her eyes on Miley's and didn't look away as the brunette dropped her arms to her sides, all but the top two buttons done.</p>
<p>Lilly sat up and scooted to the end of the bed, now placed directly in front of Miley. Her tongue darted out and wet her dry lips, swallowing hard as she reached out to grab both of Miley's hands. Miley stared down at her, inwardly grinning as Lilly's fingertips tickled her palms. The blonde pulled her closer, her hands dropping Miley's as she placed them on the brunette's hips. Miley felt her breath hitch in her chest and ran her fingers through Lilly's silky hair.</p>
<p>"What're you doin', Lil?" she murmured, unable to look away from the clouded blue eyes staring back at her.</p>
<p>Lilly immediately broke eye-contact and held Miley's hips tighter as she stood up. Her arms snaked around the taller girl's waist and she pulled Miley into a hug, burying her face in her shoulder, inhaling deeply and letting the air out slowly. Miley sighed softly and hugged her back. Her heart was beating wildly—could Lilly hear what she was doing to her?</p>
<p>"I don't know about you, but I'm starving. I'm gonna go see what your grandma's cooking up this morning," Lilly said into her shoulder after a while, "Are you coming?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded and dropped her arms. Lilly winked and slipped out of the room. Once she was out of sight, the brunette face-palmed and groaned. "Not yet," she growled out.</p>
<p>Drip. Drip. <i>Drip</i>…</p>
<p>Miley stared open-mouth at the fruit being raised to Lilly's mouth, wanting nothing more than to be the cantaloupe as the blonde's lips closed around it and she suckled it. Her teeth closed down on it and juice dripped down Lilly's chin, onto her chest.</p>
<p>Whose idea had it been to snack on fruit only twenty minutes after breakfast? Miley stifled a groan as Lilly repeated the process, this time with a cube of watermelon. That's right, it had been <i>her</i> idea and the plan had been to be as suggestive as possible. Right now, Miley just felt stupid and more than a little aroused. How had her plan backfired so badly? Miley crossed her legs and squeezed them together as best she could without being obvious. As she held herself up on outstretched arms, Lilly hunched over the plastic container of the damn fruit, they stretched out in front of them. The entire lengths of their sides were pressed together, but their close proximity wasn't nearly close enough for Miley.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you brought me, Miles," Lilly said, seemingly not noticing Miley's discomfort. "Sure, it's not exactly where I planned to spend part of my summer vacation, but… I can see why you love it here. And after this last year… it's nice to just <i>be</i>, you know? And who better to be with than you?"</p>
<p>Miley offered a half-shrug at Lilly's smile. "I figured we could both use a break," she responded, "Besides, you know almost everything about me, but you don't really know <i>this</i> side of me. I guess I just wanted you to." She ducked her head and ran a hand through her hair.</p>
<p>Lilly reached over and wrapped her hand around Miley's, both of them ignoring how sticky the fruit had made it. "Thanks for letting me in, Miles," she grinned, "So are there any other sides of you that I have yet to be introduced to?"</p>
<p>Miley chuckled softly. "Well, actually…" she trailed off as Lilly stuck yet another piece of watermelon between her lips. They closed around it and she pulled it out, licking it before replacing it.</p>
<p>And Miley watched as she sucked the fruit dry before swallowing it. Lilly smacked her lips, reddened by the watermelon. There was a foreign shine to her lips that Miley suddenly wanted to taste. She tried not to frown as Lilly put the now-empty container beside her. The blonde ran her tongue over her fingers, licking them clean of the shine similar to that on her lips. Miley was a little peeved—she was supposed to be seducing Lilly, not the other way around. Yet, here she was, at the mercy of a girl that had to know just what she was doing.</p>
<p>Miley couldn't control herself as she straightened up, leaning closer to Lilly. The other girl dropped her hands and wiped them on her jeans before turning her head slightly to the side, acknowledging Miley's proximity. "What are you doing, Miles?" she asked softly, her tone expectant. Miley was right, Lilly knew exactly what she was doing—had she been playing Milay all morning as well?</p>
<p>Miley cupped Lilly's cheek with one hand, turning her head toward her. Their noses brushed while the brunette dropped her hand to the back of her neck, pulling her in until their lips met in a gentle kiss. The first few seconds were tentative, hesitant as they grew used to the feel of each other. Then Miley's lips parted and Lilly took her bottom lip between hers and sucked, hearing and feeling Miley sigh against her.</p>
<p>Lilly broke away for only a second before the brunette caught her lips, heatedly kissing her before nipping her bottom lip and slowly running her tongue over it it. They remained connected and opened their mouths a little wider, their tongues tentatively brushing against each other. Each stroke of her tongue made Miley shudder and Lilly had to pull away, her feelings threatening to overwhelm her.</p>
<p>"What are we doing?" Lilly whispered against her lips.</p>
<p>"I believe it's called kissing," Miley responded with a smile, "I don't know about you, but I'd <i>really</i> like to do it again."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled back and applied the slightest pressure against the brunette's lips. "I do—you have no idea how much I want to."</p>
<p>Miley straddled Lilly's lap and their lips met once more. The taller girl held the blonde's face in her hands as she kissed her repeatedly, each kiss growing in intensity. Lilly's back soon hit the blanket beneath her, and she rolled her hips against Miley's. She grabbed the brunette's hips, her fingers digging in as Miley tore her lips away and brought them to her ear.</p>
<p>"Want to go for a roll in the hay?" Lilly stilled beneath Miley, who sat up and looked down at her. Guilt was rising in Miley's throat like bile at the look that crossed Lilly's face. She was going too far with—she was selfish, thinking only of herself and her selfish needs. What was <i>wrong</i> with her? "We don't have to if you don't want to, Lil," she said finally, "I shouldn't be pushing you like this. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Lilly sat up as well and moved her hands between them, her fingers working the buttons of Miley's shirt. "You're not, Miley," she replied gently, pecking Miley's lips. "You'd know if I was against this. I'd probably be halfway to Malibu right now." Lilly opened Miley's shirt and ran her hands over her stomach, lightly dragging her fingernails over her toned abs. "I wouldn't be touching you like <i>this</i>…" her hands rose higher, covering Miley's breasts. She squeezed them lightly, watching as Miley threw her head back, emitting a low growl. "You know, I really think that <i>you</i> are the beautiful one."</p>
<p>"I could disagree with that," she groaned. Miley dropped her head back down and kissed Lilly softly before pulling back slowly, a mischievous look on her face. "What do you say we take a look and figure it out later?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded. Miley began to shed the blonde's clothes, slowly as to take in every inch of skin being exposed to her. More than once, her lips found Lilly, kissing and tasting the soft skin beneath her. "You are beautiful," Miley breathed out, hardly noticing as Lilly hovered over her, doing the same to her.</p>
<p>"Why do you want this?" Miley blurted out, suddenly shy. A light pink tinge spread out over her cheeks as Lilly froze, looking down at her with a blank look.</p>
<p>After a moment, a look of understanding crossed Lilly's face and she bent down to kiss her softly on the mouth. "I don't just want this, I want <i>you</i>," she responded quietly, her words painfully honest. "You've always been here for me. You put me back together after Oliver broke me. I don't know how you did it, but you made me fall in love with you and I can't even tell you how it feels, knowing you feel the same way about me… you do, right?"</p>
<p>Miley jerked her head up and down, curling her hands around the back of Lilly's neck, pulling her closer. Their lips touched briefly. "Yes. I do—I love you so much, Lil."</p>
<p>"I love you so much," Miley whispered against Lilly's lips. She slid her hands down to cup Lilly's breasts, flicking her thumb over her nipple. A low groan emitted from Lilly as she dropped her head, panting heavily against Miley's neck. "You are <i>so</i> incredibly beautiful."</p>
<p>Lilly squeezed her eyes shut as she felt both of Miley's hands moving gently against her; she wanted to move and give some of the pleasure she was receiving, but she was at a loss at what to do. "What do I do, Miley?" she asked. "You have to tell me what to do."</p>
<p>"I can show you," Miley offered, but Lilly shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, I want to do this," she said resolutely, "Please, just—"</p>
<p>"Get on your side," Miley softly cut her off.</p>
<p>Lilly complied immediately, holding herself up on one elbow. Miley took her free hand and brought it down to where she needed it. Lilly swallowed hard as her fingers met a distinct wetness, one that was completely unfamiliar to her. Miley pressed two of Lilly's fingers down against her clit and slowly started moving them in a circular motion. Lilly kept up with the motion, and Miley brought her hand up to the back of Lilly's neck to pull her in for a kiss.</p>
<p>Lilly's lips were incredibly soft against hers, but Miley pushed her away. Her hand found the back of Lilly's head; she arched upward and moved Lilly's face toward her chest. Miley gasped as Lilly lowered her head and planted slow kisses over her breast before closing her mouth around an erect nipple. She tentatively flicked her tongue against it, growing more confident as Miley breathed heavily, her hands tangling in the Lilly's hair to pull her closer.</p>
<p>"Will you t-try something for me?" Miley stammered, breathing out heavily.</p>
<p>Lilly lifted her head. Miley's hand fell against her stomach as she looked up at Lilly, a pleading look on her face. "Anything," Lilly responded softly, "Within reason."</p>
<p>Miley gulped loudly and curled her fingers around Lilly's wrist, halting her movements. The pressure building in the pit of her stomach eased as it begged to overflow. "I want you to…" a pink tinge stained her face as she closed her eyes, taking a deep breath to steady herself. "Can you go down…?"</p>
<p>Lilly didn't wait for Miley to open her eyes to continue; she kissed her and crawled down her body. Miley felt her legs being bent at the knees and instinctively spread them apart, giving Lilly room to settle between her legs. She kept her eyes closed as she gripped the blanket on either side of her, tense as she waited to feel Lilly's mouth on her. A few moments passed before she finally felt Lilly's tongue, hot and slick as it made movements similar to those her fingers had been making. Miley jerked and sucked in a breath at the first glorious second of contact, letting out a low moan as Lilly began to suckle her clit.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Lilly murmured, pausing only for a moment.</p>
<p>"Don't you dare stop," Miley groaned and lifted one of her hands to Lilly's head, running her fingers through the silky blonde locks. With her free arm, she propped herself up on one elbow and stared down at Lilly. The blonde's eyes were already locked on her and Miley felt herself start to burn up. She bit her lip and tried to pull Lilly closer, so much closer than she already was.</p>
<p>Lilly obediently continued, beginning to crave the taste of the girl that was starting to writhe against her. Miley began to whimper, feeling searing heat unraveling in her abdomen; the coil inside grew tighter and tighter until she crashed back onto the floor. Both of her hands were now tangled in Lilly's hair, running her fingers through it.</p>
<p>"Come for me, cowgirl." Lilly whispered, her breath hot against Miley.</p>
<p>At those words, Miley's back arched violently and she chanted Lilly's name as she was completely overwhelmed by the intensity of her orgasm. Lilly glanced up at her, taking in the beautiful sight of Miley feeling such <i>bliss</i>, but she couldn't bring herself to lift her head. Miley was intoxicating, and she was going to take in as much of her as possible while she could. The brunette beneath her arched again a few short minutes later; Lilly took in the result of her second release that seemed even sweeter than before, then crawled up Miley's body. Her mouth found the taller girl's breasts, not straying from them even as Miley tugged at her.</p>
<p>Miley whimpered. "Oh, God, <i>Lilly</i>! Come up here, Lil."</p>
<p>Lilly reluctantly withdrew her mouth from Miley's breasts and came to lay beside her. She drew Miley into her arms, ignoring their slick sweat-covered skin as they pressed against each other completely. It was mildly uncomfortable, but holding each other more than made up for a little perspiration. Miley laid her head on Lilly's shoulder, tangling their legs together as one arm snaked over the blonde's midsection and held her tight.</p>
<p>"I'm a little upset, Miles," Lilly murmured seriously into Miley's hair.</p>
<p>Miley tilted her head to press a kiss to Lilly's bare shoulder. "What could you possibly be upset about?" she asked tiredly.</p>
<p>Lilly sighed heavily. "You kind of pulled me away from something I was really enjoying."</p>
<p>Miley cracked a grin. "I'm sorry, Lillian. You're going to have to wait for some one-on-two time with the girls," she teased, chuckling to herself. Lilly looked on with raised eyebrows as Miley settled on top of her, resting her chin on folded arms.</p>
<p>"Just what are you up to?" Lilly wondered.</p>
<p>"Well, you see, uh," Miley paused to clear her throat, "You let me go first, so I'm pretty much required to return the favor in full. You know, Southern hospitality and all that."</p>
<p>Lilly smirked and caught her lips in a searing kiss. "Well then, what are you waiting for, Miss Stewart? Show me how you Southerners do it."</p>
