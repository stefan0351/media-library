<p>B'Elanna woke up with a start and immediately noticed where she was, or rather where she was not. The last thing she could remember was that they had another unidentified shuttle craft malfunction (tm) which caused them to have another crashlanding (tm) on another planet which was inhabited with a as too yet unidentified species (tm). Which in turn caused them to have another shuttle loss (tm). </p>

		<p>She groaned and tried to stand up, only to find herself lying face to face with a certain ex-Borg. B'Elanna merely arched a brow, and tried to extricate herself from the not entirely uncomfortable situation. Seven's legs however, failed to cooperate with the half Klingon's wishes, as they were wrapped around her own, effectively keeping her pinned down to Seven's warm body. </p>

		<p>"Seven." There was no response. "Hey...Seven, would you mind." </p>

		<p>The Borg woman moaned softly, but just rolled slightly on her side and answered with, "just 5 point 22 more minutes Captain." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna rolled her eyes. She imitated the ship's horn and then the femine computer's voice, "warning, warp core breach in 30 seconds." </p>

		<p>"Wa...what?" Seven's cobalt blue eyes shot open and she tried to stand up immediately, and found it impossible as her legs were tangled with B'Elanna's. She arched the brow with the ocular implant. "A warp core breach?" </p>

		<p>"Hey you wouldn't wake up, and would you mind letting my legs go so I can stand up, I'm starting to get sore in this position," B'Elanna complained. </p>

		<p>"Getting sore is irrelevant," the drone said. </p>

		<p>"Shut up and get that Borg butt moving," B'Elanna returned. </p>

		<p>"Where are we?" Seven said standing up after finally having disentangled her limbs from B'Elanna's own. </p>

		<p>"Beats the hell out of me. The planet is supposed to be inhabited, but I don't see anybody greeting us, do you?" </p>

		<p>"Who beats the hell out of you?" Seven said looking around but did not see anybody. </p>

		<p>"It's a phrase Seven, meaning I don't have a clue." B'Elanna looked around and observed her surroundings. They were in some kind of jungle, including enormous trees and all kinds of insects and other small creatures scurrying around. The chief engineer shuddered, she hated bugs. </p>

		<p>"Are you malfunctioning, Lieutenant?" </p>

		<p>"No." </p>

		<p>"Are you sure, you shuddered a few seconds ago, and your body temperature increased steadily when you were lying on top of me in the shuttle moments before. Perhaps I should examine you more closely?" </p>

		<p>"I said no...hmm...examine me more closely huh?" B'Elanna grinned like the cat that ate the canary. </p>

		<p>Seven gave B'Elanna a confused look then something seemed to dawn on her. "I do not mean in that way. I believe the last time somebody tried to examine you more closely in that way, Lieutenant Paris was in Sickbay for a week, and not as in on duty." </p>

		<p>"Hmph, Tom's just whiny, I really didn't go that rough on him," B'Elanna said dissapointed at the fact that Seven had refused her offer. </p>

		<p>"Two of his ribs were bruised, his left arm dislodged, and a few of his fingers broken, amongst other smaller injuries," Seven reported. </p>

		<p>"What can I say, Klingons are erhm...rough with their affection." </p>

		<p>"Indeed." </p>

		<p>"Look Seven we should really try to find a way to contact Voyager and get off this planet so let's get moving, because I got a weird feeling about all of this." </p>

		<p>"A weird feeling? You have been giving me incorrect information then, you said you were functioning well within normal parameters." </p>

		<p>"SEVEN!!" </p>

		<p>"I will comply."</p>

		<hr></hr>
		
		<p>As the two women trekked through the dense jungle, they both silently agreed not to break that silence...or something. Until Seven suddenly stopped dead in her tracks, her Borg enhanced hearing picking up something that was moving through the underbrush. </p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Torres." </p>

		<p>"Seven?" </p>

		<p>"I'm picking up a sound just a little ahead, I think it originates from the east. Perhaps it would be wise for us to investigate it." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna patted her chest. "I'm a Klingon, well a half-Klingon, but a Klingon nevertheless, I can take care of myself. I will find the thing that makes the sound, and eliminate it, if it's a threat." </p>

		<p>"I do not doubt your ability to deal with a difficult situation, however it is more logical to have backup in the case it is a large predator," Seven said standing ramrod straight. </p>

		<p>The chief engineer growled. "I told you...Miss Borg, I can damn well take care of myself, now you stay here and I'm gonna have a looksie." </p>

		<p>"Very well." </p>

		<p>Just 1 point 13 minutes later B'Elanna ran up to Seven screaming bloody murder. Seven's eyes got wide, and she looked around for the predator that she thought would be surely following the anguished Klingon. Her eyes became as large as saucers when the half Klingon jumped in her arms and kept yelling for another 36 seconds. </p>

		<p>Then the drone composed herself enough to lower the half Klingon's shuddering form to the the ground and raised her finely shaped eyebrow into a question. "Lieutenant Torres, what is the source of your distress." </p>

		<p>"It was a mouse, it was a goddamn mouse," B'Elanna said screaming again when the rodent in question ran towards the half Klingon." </p>

		<p>"Aieeeeee, Seven kill it goddamnit, Aieeeeee." </p>

		<p>Seven merely raised her eyebrow even higher, until it almost touched her hairline, and watched amused, although that should not be possible being Borg, at the scene unfolding in front of her. The mouse was actually chasing the half Klingon who was running in circles screaming on the top of her lungs. Finally B'Elanna jumped the surprised former Borg again, locking her ankles around Seven's back, so the drone couldn't put her down this time. </p>

		<p>However the half Klingon surprised Seven so much, the drone had no time to compensate for the lack of balance, and stumbled backward, her arms swinging around, trying to regain her equilibrium, and failing. The end result was they both fell off a small cliff, tumbling down through the soft mud, and came to a halt, when they rolled into a small puddle of water. </p>

		<p>Seven raised her head from her position between the half Klingon's legs, and looked at two brown eyes who were staring at her in a amused way. "I thought you said you didn't want to examine me in this way Seven?" </p>

		<p>"I..." Seven stood up, and looked at the small Klingon form below her. She remembered one of the Doctor's lessons, and stretched her hand towards B'Elanna. The Klingon regarded the hand for a second and then took it, and was hoisted upwards into a standing position. </p>

		<p>Suddenly B'Elanna's eyes went wide. "Seven I think we found the local inhabitants."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Strip, both of you." </p>

		<p>"WHAT? Are you out of your damn mind, I'm not undressing myself for no reason." </p>

		<p>"Strip, or I will have my guards do it for you." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna watched the female guards in question, raising their knives. Then she looked around for a way to escape, and found none. "Who are you, where are we, and why the hell do we have to strip?" </p>

		<p>"First you strip then I will answer your questions," the female who seemed to be the boss commanded. </p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Torres, I believe it would the best to do as they say. I believe we will not get any answers to our questions if we do not cooperate," Seven said raising her hand to the zipper on the back of her silvery biosuit. </p>

		<p>"This was so not what I expected a simple dilithium scanning mission to end up like," B'Elanna said grumbling, but began to undress herself. She felt scrutinized, which was not that strange, having at least 5 pairs of eyes on her as she stripped. They had both been escorted from the jungle towards a small town of a humanoid species (tm). The weird thing was every single inhabitant of the town was female, it made B'Elanna wonder how they reproduced. She vaguely remembered reading about the amazon tribes in ancient Earth history, they consisted completely of female warriors. The question was how come that she came across a similar tribe in the Delta Quadrant. Weirder things happened though, or as Janeway had put it. We're Starfleet, weird is part of the job. </p>

		<p>As B'Elanna was completely nude, she couldn't help look sideways and admire the perfection of the Borg woman standing next to her. Her mouth hung open slightly, as she openly gaped, then realizing where she was, and that there was a puddle of drool forming next to her feet, at least she hoped it was drool, she quickly composed herself again. </p>

		<p>"Now will you explain who you are, where we are, amongst the other questions I got, and most of all why the hell do we have to strip?" </p>

		<p>"You have to strip because I want to examine you, we only accept females in our town, and only the ones who seem to be able to handle themselves," The female leader said her dark green eyes twinkling. "The other reason is because you are not allowed to wear clothes which cover one's body completely." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna snickered. "Now there's something different, from where we come, it is indecent to wear anything less covering." </p>

		<p>The female smiled, and moved a hand through her silvery hair. "You seem a warrior type, we have also never come across anybody having that color hair. Oh where are my manners, I am Je'Mal. I am the leader of the southern most tribe of the Jamza's." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna noticed for the first time all the females seemed to have silvery hair, and the same dark green color of eyes. "Uhmm, I am honored to meet you, however I feel slightly uncomfortable having a conversation with you in this state," the half Klingon said, slightly blushing as she gestured to her nude body. </p>

		<p>"I do not understand completely, we do not feel it necessary to hide one's beauty behind layers of clothing. However we do believe that walking around in the nude can have certain side-effects as well that it can be slightly uncomfortable," Je'Mal said. She clapped her hands and two of the Jamza females walked from behind the curtains of the palace-like building they had been brought too. </p>

		<p>The half Klingon blushed slightly again at the compliment Je'Mal had given her. She looked over at Seven again, noticing the other woman seemed to be oblivious to her undressed state, and not embarassed in the least. "You know Seven, sometimes I really envy you." </p>

		<p>"Lieutenant?" </p>

		<p>"I think you can call me B'Elanna for the time being, there's no other officers around. And I envy you in the way you seem to be comfortable with being well...undressed and all." </p>

		<p>"The body is but a vessel," Seven said, but her glowing skin contradicted her. She had noticed the way Torres had glanced at her, and seemingly had admired Seven's nude body, and the drone had not been able to resist stealing a glance at the half Klingon's well muscled body herself, although she would never admit it. </p>

		<p>"And what a vessel it is," B'Elanna said grinning, and surpressing the urge to wolf whistle. </p>

		<p>The two female Jamza's stopped in front of the two Starfleet women, and without a word started to dress them in the same clothes the rest of the tribe seemed to wear. Which consisted of a reddish piece of cloth that was wrapped around their waist, ending just above the knees, and of a light brown shirt, which was adorned with red figures. Their footwear consisted of brown sandles. </p>

		<p>"Now you can ask me your questions," Je'Mal said, having noticed the way her two female guests had been looking at each other's bodies. </p>

		<p>"Well we have a request actually," B'Elanna said, adjusting to her underwearless new clothes. "We are actually part of a crew of a space faring vessel," she explained, not knowing if she was breaking any rules, but not caring really, she wanted out of here. "We crashed with our shuttle, and believe Voyager, our spaceship, does not know where we are, do you know of any way we can contact them?" </p>

		<p>"Yes we do," Je'Mal said a dark look coming over her face all of a sudden then it was gone just as fast as it had appeared, and B'Elanna wondered if she had just imagined it. "Although we might seem to be a primitive race to you, we are actually highly evolved, we just choose this way of life to stay in sync with the nature of Beslos." </p>

		<p>"However I will first have to contact the main leader, and discuss this with her. I will let my servants Malga and Iri bring you to your temporarely rooms, and inform you of her decision as soon as possible." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna nodded, although she was not entirely pleased that it would take longer then expected, there was a chance the Jamza would allow them to contact Voyager. And if not it would only be a matter of time for Janeway to find them anyways. "That seems reasonable, I thank you for your hospitality," B'Elanna said smiling. </p>

		<p>"No thank you's necessary, it is not often we get a visit from a dark-haired one," Je'Mal said smiling and admiring the hair in question. </p>

		<p>Then she clapped and another pair of servants, apparantly Malga and Iri appeared from behind the curtains and escorted the half Klingon and former drone away. As soon as they had dissapeared, Je'Mal smiled and looked at the woman who sat a few feet away from her. </p>

		<p>"What do you think, Sa'Ni? They obviously are drawn to each other, but seem to keep their emotions in check too much, especially the one with the silvery adornments." </p>

		<p>Sa'Ni smiled and gave her wife a passionate kiss. "I believe so Je'Mal, maybe we should just give them a little hand." </p>

		<p>Je'Mal giggled. "Okay we should let the servants prepare the tansa-juice then. That should help their amorous feelings float to the surface, but not too much, we don't want them to break down their room," Je'Mal said bursting into another fit of giggles. </p>

		<p>"You're such a sneak," Sa'Ni said. </p>

		<p>"Yes and you love me for it," Je'Mal countered. </p>

		<p>"Yes I do." And the two woman shared another passionate kiss, walking to their own quarters after giving the servants the order to prepare the tansa-juice.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"So now what do we do?" B'Elanna said out loud, surveying their quarters, and actually avoiding looking at the Borg woman who seemed to look even more attractive then in her normal biosuit, which already left nothing to the imagination. </p>

		<p>"Perhaps we should ask for some nutritional supplements, and discuss what we should do next, or think over why the shuttle crashed without a acceptable reason." </p>

		<p>"I don't have a frigging clue why the shuttle crashed," the half Klingon said pacing around their small quarters, which had a window with a view on a beautiful garden. She had not noticed at first that Je'Mal had said they were being escorted to their *room* not rooms. B'Elanna wondered how she was going to sleep with the Borg nearby. </p>

		<p>Her musings were interupted by a knock on the door. "I come to bring you something to eat and drink, with the blessings of our noble leader," a beautiful Jamza woman said, a tray with all kinds of fruit on it, in her hands. </p>

		<p>"Thank you," B'Elanna said grabbing the tray of food which looked defenitly good enough to eat, out of the hands of the female servant. </p>

		<p>"Enjoy your meal. I also regret to inform, the both of you will not be allowed to leave these quarters for today, our leaders orders. Nightfall will arrive very soon anyways, so there is no real reason to leave your room either, have a good night of sleep," the female said bowing slightly and leaving the room. </p>

		<p>The click coming from outside of their room clued B'Elanna in that there was no ignoring the leaders orders to stay inside either. "Well I guess we better have dinner then," B'Elanna said her stomach agreeing as it chose exactly that time to rumble loudly. </p>

		<p>B'Elanna managed to get Seven to eat as well, and they both consumed some of the exotic fruit in a comfortable silence. The half Klingon then grabbed the cup of fluid and seemed to study it for some time, and smelling it. </p>

		<p>"Is there something the matter Lieu...B'Elanna," Seven corrected herself. </p>

		<p>"I got a feeling something is wrong with this drink, but I don't pick up anything by it's smell. It seems harmless," B'Elanna shrugged and took a sip. </p>

		<p>"Is there any trace of synthanol in the beverage?" </p>

		<p>"Nope, seems a harmless drink. Tastes a little like forest-berries," B'Elanna said, but she did get a warm feeling all of a sudden. </p>

		<p>Seven looked at her own cup as if it was going to attack her any moment, then she mimicked B'Elanna's earlier gesture, and took a sip. "The taste is not entirely unpleasant." </p>

		<p>B'Elanna's didn't hear Seven however. Her skin was glowing, every cell in her body feeling as if it was on fire. The half Klingon's eyes dilated, and a intense desire overwhelmed her. </p>

		<p>"B'Elanna? Are you functioning..." </p>

		<p>Seven stopped mid-sentence as the half Klingon suddenly faced her. The drone was speechless as she noticed the signs of arousal the chief engineer was showing. Then she noticed her own body was malfunctioning as well. The spot between her legs was getting wet and her own eyes dilated, as she took in the sight of the caramel-skinned woman in front of her. </p>

		<p>Without another word the two woman moved forward and started to kiss, pulling each other's clothes off and moving towards the big king-size bed in the middle of the room. </p>

		<p>Outside the Starfleet women's room Je'Mal and Sa'Ni were eavesdropping on the pair. "Oh damn I think the servants put too much tansa-juice in the cups again. Ah well, they have to clean the mess up tomorrow-morning themselves." </p>

		<p>"Oh, Seven, don't stop now." </p>

		<p>Sa'Ni grinned at her wife. "I think their enjoying theirselves, like a lot. So what do you plan to do with them after today? Are you gonna contact thier vessel, wife?" </p>

		<p>"Yeah I guess I better, they don't really belong here, though the dark haired one would have been a great addition to the southern tribe," Je'Mal answered. Her statement was followed by a loud scream coming from the room they were standing in front of. </p>

		<p>"B'Elanna have I hurt you?" </p>

		<p>"Seven, come here and I will show you how much you have hurt me." </p>

		<p>"I will comp......Ahhhh." </p>

		<p>"Yep, they really are enjoying theirselves," Je'Mal answered pulling her wife to their own quarters.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>One slightly embarassed half Klingon and a certain ex-Borg were standing in Janeway's ready room, in front of the Captain's desk. </p>

		<p>"Ladies, do you have anything to report about your experiences on the Beslos planet?" </p>

		<p>"No Ma'am just that they were very kind in helping us out, and they are pretty advanced but prefer to live a simple life to stay in tune with nature," B'Elanna said but kept stealing glances at the woman standing next to her. </p>

		<p>"Seven?" </p>

		<p>"I have nothing to add to B'El...Lieutenant Torres her report," Seven said correcting herself quickly. </p>

		<p>B'Elanna suddenly grinned a bit. "I did find one of Seven's ticklish spots" </p>

		<p>"WHAT?" the Captain asked her eyes almost bulging out. </p>

		<p>"I said that Seven helped me out a lot," B'Elanna said, keeping the urge to giggle at bay, although with trouble. </p>

		<p>Janeway thought she noted a small blush suddenly creeping up the normally so emotionless face of the drone, but it was gone a few seconds later, and she wondered if she had just imagined it. "Uhmm...very well then, I still wish to receive a report on my desk by tomorrow noon, about how it was possible that we lost yet another shuttle (tm). That was all, dismissed." </p>

		<p>"Yes Captain," the women said in unison, and turned to leave the Captain's ready room. </p>

		<p>As they left, they didn't notice that the Captain's yaw suddenly hit the ground. Janeway wondered how it was possible the former drone had a hickey on the side of her neck. She blinked her eyes and decided to cut down on the coffee a bit.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The person who thought he was God's gift to woman (yeah right), also known as Tom Paris was walking towards his girlfriend's quarters in a good mood. He figured that the two days that B'Elanna had been gone, she would have forgiven him a bit for the way he had behaved towards her, and had forgotten all about the argument they had been having before she left for the mission with Seven of Nine. </p>

		<p>He grinned his boyish smile, the one from which he believed would get any woman in bed (in his dreams). His body was still a bit sore from the half Klingon's way of expressing herself when she hadn't gotten what she wanted. Tom was just glad she hadn't pulled off his considerable sized hose (laughter). </p>

		<p><Tom Paris> Okay, that's it, will you cut that out. </p>

		<p><Author> Well I'm sorry, but you're such a easy target. </p>

		<p><Tom Paris> I'm abused as much as it is. </p>

		<p><Author> Oh allright, geez. </p>

		<p><Tom Paris> Thank you. </p>

		<p>Without bothering to use the door chime, Tom walked into his lovers quarters. "Hey B'Elanna, how was your trip?" </p>

		<p>There was no answer, and helmboy raised his eyebrows slightly in confusion. "B'Elanna...? Honey I'm home...?" </p>

		<p>The door to the bedroom swooshed open. "Oh my......" *thud*. </p>

		<p>Apparantly Tom Paris his brains, or the weak excuse for them, had not been able to cope with the scene that had been unfolding in front of him. So his brain had shut down, and his body had hit the bedroomfloor a second later. </p>

		<p>The two figures occupying the bedroom weren't aware they had a uninvited guest however, and they continued to sleep further in post-coital-bliss. On the bed, B'Elanna and Seven's bodies were a mess of arms and feet, completely entangled.</p>
