<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 4: Creating Bonds-->

<p>Buffy woke up the next morning with a smile on her face. She had forgotten how good it felt to smile. She dipped her head down. Her arm was wrapped around Willow, and Willow’s head was on her shoulder. She was still asleep. Buffy smiled again.</P>
<p>Carefully she propped herself up and looked at the blanket that was covering them.</P>
<p><I>‘That wasn’t there last night…mom! Does she know?’</I></P>
<p>She heard noise in the kitchen. Quietly, and reluctantly, she got untangled from her position on the couch. She stood up, and covered Willow again with the blanket. She kissed Willow’s hair, and walked into the kitchen.</P>
<p>Her mom was making breakfast.</P>
<p>"Hi honey. I didn’t wake you did I?"</P>
<p>"Nope. I was up."</P>
<p>"Do you want some breakfast?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. Smells good."</P>
<p>"How about Willow?"</P>
<p>"Still asleep. I didn’t want to wake her."</P>
<p>For a few seconds they didn’t speak.</P>
<p>"Did…did you cover us last night?"</P>
<p>"You two looked so peaceful."</P>
<p>Buffy didn’t know what to say.</P>
<p>"You care for her don’t you?"</P>
<p>"How’d you know?"</P>
<p>"I paid attention."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled.</P>
<p>"So…what happens now?"</P>
<p>"It’s your life. At least this is something I can handle. I can be here for you. This is more normal than demons. "</P>
<p>"You’re not going to pass out on me?"</P>
<p>"Did you want me to?"</P>
<p>Buffy laughed.</P>
<p>"Willow’s nice. And I’ve never seen you this happy before. Why would I not be okay?"</P>
<p>Buffy hugged her mom.</P>
<p>"Breakfast is ready."</P>
<p>"Okay. I…just remembered something. I’ll be right down."</P>
<p>Buffy ran upstairs to her room. She opened the top drawer of the bureau that was by her bed. She looked at the two Claddgah rings that were inside for a moment, and shut the drawer. She got an idea.</P>
<I><P>‘I need to think.’</P>
</I><P>She walked into her mom’s room and saw the mask her mom got from the Gallery on the wall.</P>
<I><P>‘Scary.’</P>
</I><P>She left the room. As she was coming downstairs, she saw Willow walking towards the kitchen, yawning.</P>
<p>"Look who’s up."</P>
<p>"Morning, Buffy." She smiled. </P>
<p>"Mom’s got breakfast ready. Do you want?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded, and they went into the dining room. Later, while they were eating, Buffy brought up the mask.</P>
<p>"That mask is really creepy, mom."</P>
<p>"It’s priceless. I just wish I knew more about it."</P>
<p>"You could ask Giles." </P>
<p>"Yeah. He’s really good with artifacts and stuff." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Maybe I will."</P>
<P>Joyce looked at the two of them.</P>
<P>"You take good care of my daughter, Willow."</P>
<p>Willow looked at Buffy. She looked back, telling her, <I>‘It’s okay. She knows.’ </I>She looked at Joyce.</P>
<p>"Don’t worry, Mrs. Summers. We’re good at taking care of each other."</P>

<p>The last week before school passed by uneventfully, and now Willow was walking through the halls of Sunnydale High starting her senior year. She was making her way to her chemistry class.</P>
<p>Everyone was staring at her. She could hear people snickering quietly.</P>
<p><I>‘Well now I know the whole student body knows.’</I></P>
<p>She breathed a sigh of relief, when she reached the classroom. She made her way to a lab table, and sat next to Buffy. Cordelia and Xander were sitting behind them. Buffy saw the expression on her face.</P>
<p>"You too, huh?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded.</P>
<p>"Don’t listen to them."</P>
<p>Harmony and one of her friends were sitting the next aisle over.</P>
<p>"I don’t know why I’m surprised. They’re already weird. This is probably nothing to them." Harmony whispered.</P>
<p>Willow saw Buffy’s anger building.</P>
<p>"Don’t, Buffy." She said softly.</P>
<p>"So Willow, how long have you been keeping this a secret? I thought you just were too brainy to go out with guys. I had no idea you were, you know. So what’s it like? Having to kiss a girl cause no guy would ever go near you. " Harmony said with too much joy.</P>
<p>Cordelia leaned over to get closer to Harmony.</P>
<p>"Why are you asking, Harmony? You already know what it’s like." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>Harmony went wide-eyed.</P>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</P>
<p>"Don’t play dumb. Oh wait, you are. Eight grade, Jodie Keeler’s fourteenth –"</P>
<p>"You wouldn’t." Harmony whispered.</P>
<p>"Try me. In two minutes, nobody in the senior class will ever go near you again."</P>
<p>The teacher walked in, and Harmony pretended to be writing in her notebook.</P>
<p>"Way to go, Cordy." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Yeah, thanks." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Willow managed a weak smile for Cordelia’s benefit, and looked down at the table.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>After class, they all went to the library. Willow led the pack, and sat on the steps. Buffy followed closely behind, and sat next to her. Willow was crying softly, and Buffy wrapped her arms around her. Giles walked over.</P>
<p>"Is everything all right?" He asked.</P>
<p>Buffy looked up at him.</P>
<p>"Word got around."</P>
<p>"Oh." He paused, unsure of what to say. "I’ll be…" Giles pointed to the office, and Buffy nodded.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry, Buffy. I got your shirt all wet." Willow said, sniffing.</P>
<p>Buffy chuckled softly.</P>
<p>"It’s okay, Will. They really got to you, didn’t they?"</P>
<p>"I’m used to being ignored, and now when people finally talk to me, all they do is hurt me."</P>
<p>"You wanna hear my other philosophy?"</P>
<p>"Besides ‘Life is Short’? Yeah, I do."</P>
<p>"Ignore anyone and everyone who tries to make you feel bad. Because they just like to hurt you because it makes them feel like a bigger person then they actually are."</P>
<p>"So basically, ‘Screw them’."</P>
<p>"Okay, so your term was a little more direct."</P>
<p>Willow smiled slightly, but began to worry again.</P>
<p>"But what if word gets around to Principal Snyder? He could tell my parents, and…"</P>
<p>"Snyder can’t do anything. And if he does somehow get word to your parents, I’ll be there to back you up."</P>
<p>Willow smiled, and they noticed the rest of the gang behind them.</P>
<p>"Oh, hi guys. Didn’t see you there." Buffy said.</P>
<p>They all grinned.</P>
<p>Buffy helped Willow stand up, and Giles came out of the office.</P>
<p>"Oh. I almost forgot. Mom invited everyone over for dinner tonight. You too, Giles. So it would make me extremely happy if you said there was no big evil I had to fight tonight."</P>
<p>"Buffy, there is no big evil you have to fight tonight." Giles said.</P>
<p>"Wow. I wasn’t expecting that answer. Yay!"</P>
<p>Willow walked over to Cordelia.</P>
<p>"Thanks for what you said in class, Cordy. You didn’t have to."</P>
<p>"I’m sorry you had to go through that. Don’t ever listen to what Harmony says, okay?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded. Cordelia really was one of them now.</P>
<p>"Was I really like her?"</P>
<p>They all nodded.</P>
<p>"Why didn’t you shoot me?"</P>
<p>"Believe me, we wanted to." Xander quipped.</P>
<p>He got a playful slap on the arm, and they settled into meaningless conversation.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy had been debating what to do for a little over a week now. She could see Willow’s uncertainty, and she knew that this would help both of them. She had a half an hour before her daily workout at the library, so she had to make this quick.</P>
<p>She made her way into the jewelry store, and spotted the item she wanted. In case Willow didn’t know how much she meant to her, this would create a bond between them, so that no matter what, they’d always stick together.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Joyce had a chicken in the oven. It was four-thirty, so it would be done in another hour. Just in time for when everybody was going to show up. There was knock at the door. Checking the progress of dinner, she then made her way to the foyer.</P>
<p><I>‘Probably one of the kids.’</I></P>
<p>Needless to say, she was surprised when she opened the door.</P>
<p>"Mr. Giles."</P>
<p>"Hello, Joyce."</P>
<p>After several seconds of silence, she realized he was still standing outside.</P>
<p>"Please…come in."</P>
<p>"Thank you."</P>
<p>He came in and shut the door behind him.</P>
<p>"Buffy’s okay, isn’t she?" Joyce asked, suddenly wondering why he was here so early.</P>
<p>"Yes, she’s fine. She’s with everyone in the library. She’s exercising, and she has time and time again told me it was unnecessary for me to be there during aerobics. Plus her taste in music while she works out is not exactly my style."</P>
<p>"I’ll agree with you on that."</P>
<p>"I figured if I came by early we could talk."</P>
<p>"That would help me get back in daughter’s life."</P>
<p>She didn’t say it directly, but he knew she meant, <I>‘You’ve been guiding my daughter for the past three years, and now I’d like a part of it.’</I></P>
<p>"Where would you like to start?"</P>
<p>"Why her?"</P>
<p>"Well, that’s difficult question to answer. One girl in all the world, one born with –"</P>
<p>"Buffy gave me that already, and it doesn’t answer my question."</P>
<p>"Nobody truly knows how Slayers are chosen. I was taught that it was fate. If you believe in that sort of thing of course."</P>
<p>"Fate or not, she’s seventeen years old. How can you be okay with her risking her life every single night?"</P>
<p>"Believe me, Joyce. There are times that I wished that Buffy did not have to do her duty, and all I’ve wanted to do is protect her. But she is very capable, and very committed. However, like her, I did not have a choice in my career.</P>
<p>"I became a Watcher. And I have guided many Slayers, but Buffy is the most skilled by far. I can only promise you that I will do whatever I can, whenever possible, to make sure she comes back home safe to you every day."</P>
<p>Joyce took a deep breath.</P>
<p>"Has she really saved the world?"</P>
<p>"Three times actually. And it pained her not to be able to tell you all of this, but it’s a primary code that Slayers must follow. It’s for the parents’ safety, and now that I think about it, it’s the only code she’s ever followed.</P>
<p>"She has kept you unaware of her situation not to push you away, but to keep you safe. I hope you realize that."</P>
<p>"I do, I just feel terrible. All those times I grounded her for fighting…yelled at her…"</P>
<p>"She doesn’t blame you. She has used the fact that she was grounded, many times, to get out of training. So in some cases, she was glad to be confined to her room."</P>
<p>She laughed.</P>
<p>"Buffy tells me you're somewhat of an expert on relics and things." Joyce said, changing the subject. For the moment, she was okay with everything.</P>
<p>"Somewhat, yes. Why?"</P>
<p>"I’d like to get your opinion on something."</P>
<p>Joyce started to walk upstairs, and Giles followed behind. They entered her bedroom, and Giles quickly found an odd looking mask hanging on the wall.</P>
<p>"We got a very exciting shipment in at the Gallery. I thought I'd hang this piece in here. It cheers up the room." She said.</P>
<p>"It's, striking…and Nigerian."</P>
<p>"Oh. Yes. I have this wonderful dealer who specializes in ancient artifacts, I don't know if you..."</P>
<p>"This seems awfully familiar. I think I’ll call Willow at the library. Oh, may use your phone?"</P>
<p>"Of course."</P>
<p>As Giles was dialing the number, they heard a shout from downstairs.</P>
<p>"We’re here!" Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>Giles placed the phone back down. "Figures."</P>
<p>He and Joyce went back downstairs.</P>
<p>"What are you doing back so early?" Giles asked Buffy.</P>
<p>"Early?"</P>
<p>"You can’t expect me to believe you got a workout after twenty minutes."</P>
<p>"Hey, I broke a sweat. In my book, that means I worked out. The guys can vouch for me."</P>
<p>They looked up at the gang.</P>
<p>"Can’t you?" Buffy asked, eyeing them.</P>
<p>"Oh yeah. She was…lots of sweat…real stinky…worked hard…" They all spoke together, jumbling their words. </P>
<p>"There, you see? Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get a shower." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Buffy went upstairs, leaving Joyce and Giles sighing.</P>
<p>"Kids." They both said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy dropped her bag to the floor, and then went and got a shower. Before she went downstairs, she grabbed the object she purchased off the top of her desk, and put it in her pants pocket. She knew what she was going to do.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Dinner was nice and relaxing. The conversation was normal, and best of all, tension free.</P>
<p>"Mrs. Summers, this great. I haven’t eaten food this good since…well I’ve never eaten food this good." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Thank you, Xander."</P>
<p>"Yeah not even the cook at my house makes food this good." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>They all looked at her.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"Well, not everyone has their own cook." Oz said.</P>
<p>"He’s not my cook, he’s the family cook. And I wasn’t saying that to sound snotty, I was just stating a fact."</P>
<p>"Well, thank you for the compliment. Who wants to do the dishes?"</P>
<p>Nobody moved, and then Willow jumped up.</P>
<p>"Thank you, Willow."</P>
<p>Willow stared at Buffy. Buffy stood up.</P>
<p>"I’ll help you."</P>
<p>"See? She’s a good influence on you." Joyce said.</P>
<p>"I know. Isn’t it horrible?" Buffy said playfully.</P>
<p>Willow swatted her, and they made their way to the kitchen.</P>


<hr width=100>

<p>Upstairs, in Joyce’s bedroom, a red light was shining on the door. It was coming from the mask hanging on the opposite wall. Its eyes were glowing red.</P>

<hr width=100>


<p>Buffy and Willow were washing dishes in the sink. Well actually, Buffy was washing and Willow was drying.</P>
<p>"See? This isn’t so bad, is it?"</P>
<p>"No, it’s just really dull."</P>
<p>"Okay, maybe it is." Willow laughed.</P>
<p>"You’re really okay, right?"</P>
<p>"It’ll take a little while to get used to everybody, but…"</P>
<p>"Hey, I’ve had years to deal with people saying things behind my back, I’ll help you deal too."</P>
<p>"Thanks."</P>
<p>Willow kissed her.</P>
<p>"Listen, Will…there’s something I want to…"</P>
<p>"Buffy, I have…"</P>
<P>They were interrupted by a scream.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They ran into the living room.</P>
<p>"Is everyone okay?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. It came from outside." Oz said.</P>
<p>Xander opened the door, and saw people running away from people who looked very dead. And a whole group of them, twenty or more were heading right for the house.</P>
<p>"We won’t be okay for long." He said.</P>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Cordelia asked. She looked out the door, and screamed.</P>
<p>The zombies started crashing right through the window.</P>
<p>"What do we do?" Joyce asked.</P>
<p>"Go out the back!" Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>Oz ran ahead. As the zombies came right through the back door, he ran back to the  gr   oup.</P>
<p>"It’s no good. They’re back there too." He said.</P>
<p>Three zombies started to go upstairs, ignoring the group, and the rest started to surround them.</P>
<p>"Why are they going upstairs?" Buffy asked, kicking one in the chest. It staggered, but came forward still.</P>
<p>"The mask!" Giles yelled.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"I thought I recognized your mother’s mask. That’s what they’re after!"</P>
<p>"I didn’t know the undead were so into art." Xander said, knocking one off its feet momentarily. Willow was huddled over Joyce, trying to protect her.</P>
<p>"The mask holds the power of a... zombie demon, called Ovu Mobani -Evil Eye. I don't think we can get past them." Giles said.</P>
<p>"Well, what happens if they get the mask?" Oz asked.</P>
<P>"If one of them puts it on, they become the demon incarnate."</P>
<P>"Oz, help me clear a path to the stairs. Then you and Giles take everyone upstairs and stop them from getting the mask. Hurry! They’re almost up!"</P>
<P>Oz grabbed a potted plant that was against the wall and smashed it over a zombie’s head. It fell. Buffy grabbed one by the neck, and pushed it into one of his buddies.</P>
<P>"Come on!" Xander yelled leading everyone to the stairs. They all followed, and saw two of the three zombies that went up, still on the stairs.</P>
<P>"Buff, I need a weapon!" Xander yelled.</P>
<P>Buffy ripped a post off the railing, and tossed it to him.</P>
<P>Xander and Oz charged up the stairs. Xander swung at one, making him tumble down the steps, and Oz elbowed the other one. They made it to the bedroom just as the zombie was putting on the mask.</P>
<P>"Oh dear." Giles said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>The zombie turned around. The mask was on. Willow, who had her arm protectively around Joyce, caught the thing’s gaze.</P>
<P>"Willow, don’t look into it’s eyes!" Giles yelled.</P>
<P>But it was too late. There was a bright flash, and then Willow collapsed to the ground unconscious. Oz and Xander grabbed the zombie by its arms, and shoved it out the window. It rolled down the roof, and fell to the ground.</P>
<P>Giles and Joyce crouched around Willow.</P>
<P>"I’ll go get Buffy." Oz said running out the door.</P>
<P>"Tell Buffy Mobani's power lies in his eyes! She has to go for the eyes to defeat him!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Downstairs, Buffy heard the crash and thump of the thing outside. She knew something had happened to Willow. She could feel it. Stepping on the back of a zombie, she just knocked down, she jumped up on the coffee table, and over the group of zombies threatening to overtake her. She ran out the front door.</P>
<P>She got to her porch, and saw a shovel leaning against the front of the house. She grabbed it, and ran into the yard. The zombie’s back was to her.</P>
<P>"Hey Buffy!" She heard Oz call.</P>
<P>The thing turned around. She saw his eyes glowing.</P>
<P>"Something tells me I don’t wanna look into those."</P>
<P>She lifted the shovel up, and the thing started to lock gazes with her. Shaking it off, she pulled her arm back.</P>
<P>"Hey you!" She tossed the shovel right into its eyes. It collapsed, and in a blinding light, vanished. "Made you look."</P>
<P>As she turned to go back into the house, she saw Oz.</P>
<P>"Never mind." He said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>As Buffy and Oz came in, Giles was carrying Willow down the stairs. Buffy rushed over.</P>
<P>"Is she okay?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"She’ll be fine, honey." Joyce said.</P>
<P>They laid her on the sofa, and Cordelia came from the kitchen holding a cup. She splashed Willow’s face with water. Willow stirred, and started to cough. Buffy held her head. Buffy gave Cordelia a look.</P>
<P>"What? It worked didn’t it?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<P>Buffy sighed.</P>
<P>"Yeah it did. Thanks."</P>
<P>Cordelia smiled.</P>
<P>"You okay, Will?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"I think I have a headache."</P>
<P>"I’m on aspirin duty." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Well I’d say, ‘This house is clear’." Xander said.</P>
<P>"That was the worst –" Willow said.</P>
<P>"Hey, I just got attacked by zombies. Give me a break!"</P>
<P>Oz came in with two aspirin and another cup of water. He handed them to Willow.</P>
<P>"So, is this a typical day at the office?" Joyce asked.</P>
<P>"No. This was nothing." Buffy responded.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>They cleaned up as best they could, and all said good night. Buffy asked Willow to stay a few extra minutes, and they went up to her room. When they sat on the floor, Buffy took a deep breath, and spoke.</P>
<P>"After what almost happened tonight, I don’t want to go another second without giving you one of these." Buffy said, pulling a golden Claddgah ring out of her pocket.</P>
<P> Willow looked at it, and smiled. She pulled out a ring as well.</P>
<P>"When did you –"</P>
<P>"After we dropped you off after getting my haircut, I asked Cordy to run by the jewelry store. I picked it out. Looks like you did the same thing."</P>
<P>"I wanted to give you something special…" Buffy took the silver Claddgah rings out of her bureau. "…And move on from these."</P>
<P>"Those are the rings you and Angel shared."</P>
<P>Buffy nodded. "When he turned, I was sure he would have crushed his, but after destroying the Judge, I went back to his apartment. He had cleared all his stuff out, but his ring was still sitting on top of the dresser. I took it, and I’ve had it ever since."</P>
<P>Buffy set the silver rings down between them, and started to slip her gold ring on Willow’s finger.</P>
<P>"It’s time I stopped holding on to the past. I’m committing myself to you for as long as you’ll have me."</P>
<P>Tears were rolling down both their faces, as Willow started to put her ring on Buffy’s finger.</P>
<P>"The hands represent friendship," Willow started. </P>
<P>"The crown represents loyalty," Buffy continued.</P>
<P>Finishing the final symbol together, "And the heart, represents love." </P>
<P>As the ring was situated on Buffy’s finger, the rings seemed to glow. And the silver ones vanished in the gold light.</P>
<P>"I'll always be here with you. Like you will be for me." Willow said.</P>
<P>Buffy nodded and Willow crushed her in a hug. They kissed softly, and an unbreakable bond was created.</P>
