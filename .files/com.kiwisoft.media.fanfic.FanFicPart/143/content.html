<!-- Ties \ Story -->

<p>The house had a workout room, and that's where Buffy and Faith were now. The older one was
doing pushups, and the younger one was jabbing a punching bag. It had been a week since
their arrival, and they had been all over. They followed the Freedom Trail and saw Paul
Revere's House and the Bunker Hill Monument.</p>

<p>They had gone on Duck and Whale Watching Tours, had seen Cheers, Beacon Hill, Harvard
Square, and had even gone outside the city to Lexington and Concord, where the "Shot
Around the World" was heard. Their friends enjoyed it, but it quickly got boring for them.</p>

<p>They were running out of things to see, so while Sarah and Willow were doing computer
stuff (Willow was going to get to see the company tomorrow), and Oz was on the deck
working on a new tune, the slayers decided to train. Giles would've been proud.</p>

<p>There had to be something else to do, something tourists wouldn't, but they weren't coming
up with anything. They could have sat underneath the tree for the whole rest of the
vacation, but there were other people to consider.</p>

<p>Faith, breathing heavily, ceased her punching. "What about the 'The Hammer'?"</p>

<p>"I'm not taking Willow to a bar. Especially *that* bar. Those people were insane."</p>

<p>"But you went when I took ya."</p>

<p>"That's because I was a naïve tourist and worshipped the ground you walked on." Buffy
finished her last pushup, grinning. "I know better now."</p>

<p>The brunette shook her head, and got into a fighting stance. "Sparrin' time, B. Let's go."</p>

<p>"You're on."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>THUMP. Silence. THUMP. Longer silence. CRASH.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should go make sure they're all right." Sarah said, leaning over Willow's
shoulder as the redhead typed at the computer.</p>

<p>"They're fine. They're just...really into fitness."</p>

<p>"It's good to have the drive to stay in shape -" THUMP. CRACK. "I guess."</p>

<p>Willow smiled. "That's one thing they have a lot of. Drive." She turned her attention to
the computer screen. "I think we should try to allocate more RAM to..."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Faith had Buffy pinned against the wall; she was holding her arms. This was where they
usually called a draw, but Buffy had other ideas this time. Using all her strength, she
ran forward, freed her arms, and pushed her partner into the opposite wall. Now she was
the one with the upper hand.</p>

<p>"Little extra fire today?" Faith asked with a grin. "That was pretty slick."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Buffy smiled, sweat cascading down her forehead. She then kissed her
girlfriend, officially ending the sparring session. "I love being happy. It's a good
thing, don't you think?" She freed the brunette.</p>

<p>Faith grabbed a towel off the floor, rubbed her face with it, and tossed it to Buffy. She
sat on the black, leather seat that was next to the bench-press, and immediately slouched.</p>

<p>"Definitely. Marry me?"</p>

<p>Buffy smirked. They had gone through the same routine every day since they blew up the
school, each taking turns proposing.</p>

<p>"Got a ring?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Don't got any cash, either."</p>

<p>"Guess you're out of luck then."</p>

<p>"Damn."</p>

<p>They weren't going to rush it. One of these days there would be a ring, and it would be a
surprise. A very pleasant one at that. The blonde laid flat on her back, down on the
floor, staring up at the ceiling. She thought to herself for awhile.</p>

<p>"We take them to the house."</p>

<p>"Wanna be more specific?"</p>

<p>"The one with Casper's angry cousins."</p>

<p>Faith grinned. "Now that's an idea."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Awhile later, the four friends were sitting in the hot tub on the deck, and three of them
were trying to convince Willow to go to the house. Well, Buffy was trying to, but she kept
getting distracted looking at the brunette in a bikini. It had dawned on her that they had
never seen each other like this before. In some ways, it was better than seeing each other
naked.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "No it isn't." But Faith was gorgeous on a whole new level now. It
was during these moments that she realized just how pathetically in love she was.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Willow asked, not understanding where that statement had come from.</p>

<p>Faith started talking, and inside her sister's bedroom, Joyce chose then to move away from
the sliding screen door that led out to the deck. Sarah was sitting on her bed, watching
the news on the television in the room. The prison photo that came on the screen got
Joyce's attention as well, and she sat down to listen to the female anchor.</p>

<p>"...Was serving a life sentence for the murder of his wife, which occurred in May of 1997.
Sketchy reports around the time of the arrest say that he had a daughter by the name of
Faith, but she was never located, and hasn't been seen since. Authorities have asked all
stations in the area, including this one, to tell this woman that if she sees this
newscast, to come in for questioning.</p>

<p>"They are keeping the circumstances surrounding his escape under wraps, issuing only this
statement.</p>

<p>"Quote, 'All of our department's resources are currently working around the clock to bring
this man in.' End quote. It is advised that if you do see Jack Adams, to not approach him,
as he is considered extremely dangerous. If you have any knowledge of his possible
whereabouts, please call..."</p>

<p>Sarah hit 'OFF' on the remote, and looked at her sister, wide-eyed. Joyce went over to the
door, and opened it, stepping out onto the deck.</p>

<p>"So, are you in or not, Will?" Her daughter was saying.</p>

<p>"But they're real ghosts." The redhead said.</p>

<p>"It'll be exciting."</p>

<p>"Slayers are supposed to fight ghosts. You wanna go hang out with them. I don't like this
picture."</p>

<p>"We're off duty, Red." Faith said. "And lean back. Maybe the jets'll loosen ya up."</p>

<p>"Oz, help!" She hoped he would come to her defense, but instead, he eased her back into
one of the seats, and the jets started working her neck and upper back. She hissed from
the sensations. "Ooh."</p>

<p>"Give her five minutes. Then we ask again." Buffy smiled, leaning back as well, and
closing her eyes. Then she heard the unmistakable sound of her mother clearing her throat.
They all turned. "What's up, mom?"</p>

<p>"Um...Faith?" The older woman said, not really comfortable.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" The brunette didn't like the sound of Joyce's voice.</p>

<p>"Can I talk to you...for a minute?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>("Are you going to tell Daddy where you were last night?" Jack asked as gently as he could
in his drunken state.</p>

<p>He and his daughter stood at the top of the steps that led to the basement. She stood on
the inside; he stood on the outside. Taking a swig from his bottle, he waited for the
answer. Faith shook her head. That was her time. Her father's eyes darkened.</p>

<p>"Strip." Jack ordered. "Strip, you little whore!"</p>

<p>Faith didn't even consider arguing. Shaking, she silently stripped down to nothing. He ran
his fingers down her body.</p>

<p>"Nobody would want a bitch like you, except me. Nobody. Understand?" She nodded. "I love
you, and you're damn lucky." She nodded. "You're mine. My slut."</p>

<p>"Thank you, daddy." She said meekly.</p>

<p>"Did I say you could speak?"</p>

<p>Jack crushed her throat with his hand, and then smashed the bottle into his daughter's
forehead. She lost her balance, and tumbled down the flight of stairs. She was sprawled on
the cold, damp floor, forehead bleeding, and completely naked. Not to mention that her
whole body was aching, and she couldn't tell if things were broken or not.</p>

<p>"You're gonna show me just how much you love me, later." He called down to her.</p>

<p>Faith heard the basement door slam shut, and the lock click into place. She sat in the
darkness, and didn't dare cry.)</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy was next to Faith in Boston's Police Department, her hand on the brunette's back.
Her girlfriend wasn't doing so well, and the plastic chairs which they were sitting in,
weren't helping anything. Joyce stood behind the two girls as the detective took a seat at
his desk, and for the younger slayer, there was only one thing running through her mind.</p>

<p>Why couldn't he be dead?</p>

<p>"I'm sure this is a trying time for you." The detective started saying gently, opening a
file folder that sat in front of him. Faith shrugged. "Two years ago we couldn't find
anything on you. Birth certificate, nothing. We check yesterday, in what we thought would
be a pointless attempt to get some kind of lead on your father, and we find everything.
Strange. But, we were still switching from hard copy to digital then, a lot got shuffled
around."</p>

<p>The slayers looked at one another. The Council must have been keeping Faith's records
inaccessible, but when they quit...well, they could do the math.</p>

<p>"Are you aware of what your father has done?"</p>

<p>"I was there." The detective raised his eyebrows. "We didn't have the tightest
relationship. I was afraid, so when he passed out, I finally got the guts to bolt."</p>

<p>"And you didn't think to call 911?"</p>

<p>"The guy made my life a living hell. I just wanted out. Do I need to get in depth?"</p>

<p>He looked sympathetic. "When we found him, he was just coming to. The neighbors were
complaining about the lack of noise."</p>

<p>Faith held back a laugh. "It's Southie."</p>

<p>"So I don't suppose you have any idea where he might be."</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"She's been staying with me." Buffy interjected.</p>

<p>"And you are?" The detective asked.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers."</p>

<p>"And you, ma'am?" He looked up at Joyce.</p>

<p>"Joyce Summers. Buffy is my daughter."</p>

<p>"Are you a native of the area?"</p>

<p>"No, we're from California. Here on vacation."</p>

<p>He sat back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Look," Faith said, "we're friends. Good friends." She suppressed a grin and felt the
blonde squeeze her hand. "We met a couple years ago, and before she left, I got her
address. When I took off, that's where I ended up. He doesn't even know I'm here. Really
bad timing, I guess."</p>

<p>"This brings up a whole other problem. You've gone two years as a minor without a legal
guardian?"</p>

<p>"My whole family's screwed up. They wouldn't have been any better. Don't pull this legal
crap on me, cause I know what my best interests are, and I've got good people lookin' out
for me."</p>

<p>"It says here," The detective was reading the file, "that your date of birth was September
7, 1982."</p>

<p>"She'll be an adult in three months then, right?" Buffy asked. "Can't you just let this
go?"</p>

<p>He sighed, but did notice the pleading look in the blonde girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"How much longer will you be in the city?"</p>

<p>"About a week." Joyce answered. "I can give you my sister's number and address. That's
where we're staying." She started to write on a small notepad that she had in her purse.</p>

<p>"I'll leave it at this for now. If you can think of anything that may help, give me a call
at this number." He gave Faith his card. "I would offer you protect -"</p>

<p>"Don't need it." The brunette cut him off.</p>

<p>"But that's what I thought your answer was going to be. Just watch yourself. As for your
situation..." Three women stared at him, telling him silently that there was only one
answer, and that he better pick the right one. And he thought his wife's 'Look' was
powerful. "That was never part of our discussion."</p>

<p>Buffy sighed, and the two of them started to get up.</p>

<p>"How did he escape?" He was hesitant. "I'm not gonna leak to the press."</p>

<p>"No one knows. The bars were torn clean off his cell, and two guards were found with
severe neck wounds. He must have had help, but it doesn't make any sense."</p>

<p>Faith had gone pale. "Thanks."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Back at the house, Willow put the phone down, and stared at what she had just written.
Turning to her boyfriend, she bit her lip worriedly.</p>

<p>"Right now, going to a haunted house sounds pretty fun."</p>

<p>Sarah walked into the sitting room. "Who was that?"</p>

<p>Oz answered for his girlfriend. "Wrong number."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>(Faith stood over the stove in her kitchen, boiling water for the spaghetti. Her father
and mother were sitting at the small, wooden table. They could stay in chairs, so they
were apparently only mildly drunk tonight. The brunette reached up into the cabinet to
grab the box of noodles.</p>

<p>"Where's my dinner? I expect it to be on the table when I wake up." Jack growled at her.</p>

<p>She flinched, and in her mind she was thinking, 'Don't you mean, regain consciousness?'
Instead she told him,</p>

<p>"It's comin', Daddy."</p>

<p>"Maybe if you were more goddamn responsible, I wouldn't be waiting right now."</p>

<p>"I'll do better next time."</p>

<p>He stood up with such force, that his chair went flying back into the wall.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare shut me up!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Sorry doesn’t get me food any faster, does it?"</p>

<p>He backed her up against the stove. Faith could smell the alcohol on his breath.</p>

<p>"You want your dinner, Jack?" His wife asked. "Then let her make it."</p>

<p>"Ain't nobody talkin' to you, Christine!" Jack yelled into his daughter's face, and looked
at the pot.</p>

<p>Faith risked giving her mother an appreciative smile.</p>

<p>"I'll slap that right off your face, girl." Christine promised.</p>

<p>Jack was gripping the handle of the pot now.</p>

<p>"Think it's ready."</p>

<p>"No, you have to give it -" Faith started saying.</p>

<p>"You don't think so, huh? Then we'll just have to test it."</p>

<p>He backhanded his daughter to the ground with his free hand, and then poured the scalding
hot water all over her. Most of it landed on her face, and she covered it, screaming.</p>

<p>"Hot enough?"</p>

<p>Jack added insult to injury by kicking her in the ribs and walking away. Christine came
over then, and looked down on her creation.</p>

<p>"You bring this on yourself. If you weren't so worthless, everything would be five by
five.")</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Joyce, Buffy, and Faith came into the house, and immediately sat themselves down on the
couch in the living room. The vacation was hitting a serious low. Faith's father was out
of jail, seeming to be freed, or taken, by -</p>

<p>"Vampires." Willow said, rushing into the room with Oz.</p>

<p>"What about 'em?" Faith asked first.</p>

<p>"Called. Said they'd been watching us since we got here..." Oz trailed off.</p>

<p>"And?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"They have your father, Faith." Willow said quietly. "They said that if you wanted to see
him alive again, you'd, and I'm quoting here, 'come back home and get him'."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence as they waited for the younger slayer's response. She started
laughing.</p>

<p>"Vamps aren't too bright, are they? They think I care if that..." Faith closed her eyes,
and when she opened them again, anger shown in them. "If that son of a bitch lives or
dies? I don't know why the hell they wanna get to me, but I'm not playin' their game."</p>

<p>"Playing whose game?" Sarah asked, coming in.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>A couple minutes later, Faith was lying on their bed down in the basement, playing a video
game, and Buffy was pacing. They had talking to do, and left Joyce to explain things to
Sarah. Another person was going to know their secret. It didn't seem to matter at the
moment.</p>

<p>"Stop movin', will ya? I can't see." Faith complained.</p>

<p>"Faith..."</p>

<p>"If you're gonna say what I think you're gonna say, I'll save you the trouble of wastin'
your breath. No. N.O. The best I'll do is call that cop and tell him where he could start
lookin'."</p>

<p>"You know they can't handle vampires." Faith didn't speak. "I realize your father isn't a
great person...I think he's scum for hurting you, but -"</p>

<p>"Then why  -?"</p>

<p>"Cause, scum or not, he's human."</p>

<p>"Not to me."</p>

<p>"He did horrible things to you, I know -"</p>

<p>Faith turned her head sharply, looking at her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"You don't know. You'll never know. I gave you a general overview, but there was more. A
lot more."</p>

<p>"You think I don't get that? Sometimes I picture what he might've done, things I think
were just made up by my way overactive imagination, and then I think...it probably really
happened."</p>

<p>"Should try imagining more pleasant things, B."</p>

<p>Buffy was standing in front of the TV, and Faith reached her hand out to grab the
waistband of the blonde's pants.</p>

<p>"No, not now." Buffy said, backing up. "Did I just say that?" She took a deep breath.
"Please don't turn into a brick wall on me. We don't do that with each other, and I
couldn't take it if you did."</p>

<p>Faith buried her face into the mattress, and dropped the controller on the floor with a
groan. Buffy sat next to her.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I wish I had the scars still. The burns. The cuts. To show you the results, but
then...then you probably wouldn't be able to look at me. Or..."</p>

<p>"I'd love you no matter what you looked like. You could be -"</p>

<p>"That was comforting enough. You can stop there."</p>

<p>"Good." The older slayer sighed.</p>

<p>"He's my dad." The brunette said so quietly, Buffy could barely hear. "He's a murderer, a
drunk, abusive, pathetic...but he's still my dad. And that's why, even as much as I want
him dead, even after everything he did, I still love him. How screwed up is that?"</p>

<p>"Not as screwed up as you think."</p>

<p>"But I don't love him enough to save him. I can't. I got away from him, and if I go to his
rescue...it's like I'm tellin' him he still has power over me. Or that I appreciated his
'love.'" Faith spat. "No way."</p>

<p>"If he dies, he doesn’t get to suffer in jail. You want him to suffer, don't you? I know I
do." Faith sighed, nodding. "And you're a slayer. You have to kill vampires. If they kill
him, they'll just move on to someone else. I know you don't want that."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Course not. Seeing him...I just...I'm afraid. Afraid I'll revert to
that submissive...daddy's little toy."</p>

<p>"You won't. You're strong, stronger than he is. And not just cause you can kick his ass.
You have been for a long time. I'll be right there with you. Promise."</p>

<p>"Kiss me."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Vampires. They hunt vampires." Sarah said, holding her cup of coffee loosely.</p>

<p>Joyce sat across from her at the table. "I didn't believe it either."</p>

<p>"Are we talking about Dracula?"</p>

<p>Willow and Oz were leaning up against the sink.</p>

<p>"No." The redhead shook her head. "He's just a myth. I think. Pretty sure. Yeah, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"And there are vampires all around the world? Even here, and they've got Faith's father?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much the basics." Oz confirmed.</p>

<p>"Oh, but don't worry. They're only really a big problem in Sunnydale. As long as you make
sure you know who you're inviting in, and stay in lighted places, you'll be right as
rain." Willow frowned. "Did that last part make sense?"</p>

<p>"You always make sense."</p>

<p>"I do?" His girlfriend smiled. Joyce looked at the girl, and Willow put on her serious
face. "Sorry."</p>

<p>"Are you okay, Sarah?" Joyce asked. Her sister hadn't said much.</p>

<p>"I think I'll just sit and think for awhile."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea." Buffy said, walking in with Faith. "And they'll stay with you till
we get back, then we'll answer all questions. Well, most questions."</p>

<p>"If you're going vampire dusting, we could be backup." Willow offered.</p>

<p>"I'd say yes, Red, but where we're goin'...it's not the safest place. You think vamps are
bad? Some of the people are worse." Faith explained.</p>

<p>"Think I'll take the slayers' advice on this one." Oz said.</p>

<p>"Uh...me too." The hacker agreed quickly.</p>

<p>"Stake count." The blonde said to her partner, looking in her jacket. "Three."</p>

<p>"Same." Faith nodded.</p>

<p>"Be careful." Joyce said to the two girls.</p>

<p>"Always." Her daughter said.</p>

<p>"Faith? I hope he's okay."</p>

<p>The brunette gave a fake smile.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>(He wasn't even trying to hide it this time. Right in the middle of what Faith could call
"the living room." Her shirt was off, and the only article of clothing that was still
covering her chest, was a black bra. Jack was standing over her, undoing his belt. She had
learned to numb her body when this happened. The pain would be felt after it was over
with.</p>

<p>Wrapping part of the leather belt around his fist, he started taking practice swings.</p>

<p>"You get off on pain, don't you? Masochistic bitch." He nodded in the direction of her
bra. "Take it off. I'm starting with your tits this time. At least, I think that's what
they are."</p>

<p>Faith started to unclasp.</p>

<p>"Not tonight." Christine said, grabbing hold of her head. She had a nasty headache. Jack
laughed, and kept swinging. "Not tonight. You're a perverted bastard, Jack, and I don't
feel like watching."</p>

<p>"Nobody's makin' you." He barked, turning around.  "Do you want it?"</p>

<p>"Don't threaten me. Goddamn, I hate being sober."</p>

<p>"I don't threaten, Christine. Hey, maybe I've been going about this all wrong. She did
come out of you, after all. It might not be all her fault that she's a trashy whore."</p>

<p>"You helped make her."</p>

<p>"How do I know I did? Whose is she? Who'd you fuck?" On the floor, Faith sat up. "I didn't
say you could move!"</p>

<p>"For the last fifteen years? Myself."</p>

<p>He invaded his wife's personal space. "Oh, I see the resemblance now. I shoulda taken care
of the source back then. I wouldn't have to put up with either of you if I had."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You're a piece of shit who never follows through, that's why."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?"</p>

<p>Jack coiled the belt quickly around Christine's neck, and started squeezing. When she
started turning blue, he stopped, and began using his bare hands. His eyes were wild.
After several minutes of gasping and choking sounds, the life left Christine Adams' body.
He let her drop to the floor, and faced his daughter, who had curled herself into a ball.</p>

<p>"You're...n...nex..." He was sweating heavily, his adrenaline rushing. Before he could get
it all out, Jack's eyes rolled up inside his head, and he collapsed to the floor,
unconscious.</p>

<p>Faith didn't move until about ten minutes later, when she heard a knock on the door.)</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>They got to the rundown shack Faith used to call a home with minimal incident. The gangs
hung out on the corners, but as soon as they saw the slayers' "try it" looks, they backed
off. That didn't make Southie any less frightening, though. People were drinking on steps
in front of housing projects, yelling, fighting...it was not a nice place. Buffy couldn't
believe Faith had to grow up here.</p>

<p>"There's a low window on the side of the house. It'll let ya into the basement. I'll go in
the front." Faith instructed.</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"B..."</p>

<p>"See you inside."</p>

<p>Faith paced for awhile before going in. It was the same as she remembered it, and even as
shoddy as it was, it still seemed intimidating. She didn't like that. What would he be
like? What would she do? She became pissed at herself. There was no time to dwell. She had
to be more concerned about how many vampires there were, and that Buffy had already gone
in.</p>

<p>She moved slowly up the stairs, and opening the torn, screen door, she came face to face
with a vampire.</p>

<p>"Bout time." He said.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, did I keep you waitin'?" The brunette said sarcastically. "What's the deal?"</p>

<p>"You die." He smiled. "When we heard about Kakistos, and what you did, we've been waiting
to get revenge. Our sire's hate for you has become ours."</p>

<p>"Family ties, huh?" Faith snorted.</p>

<p>"He was one of the old ones. Untainted by modern distractions.  He was a true killer.
Someone we all feared, yet respected. He was the greatest."</p>

<p>"Eh, not really." Faith was nonchalant.</p>

<p>"How dare you." He snarled.</p>

<p>"You talk like you've got buddies."</p>

<p>He nodded. "You won't attack me, because they'll kill him if you do."</p>

<p>"Who's going to kill him?" Buffy asked curiously, from behind them.</p>

<p>"What is -?" The vampire was shocked, turning his head to see the other girl.</p>

<p>"I love having the element of surprise."</p>

<p>Faith began punching the demon's face, one, two, three times. She brought her knee hard
into his chest next, and he doubled over. Bringing both fists up and connecting with his
chin, she snapped his head back, and staked his wide-open chest. Vampires were morons.
They went through all that work, and it accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" The younger slayer asked.</p>

<p>"Tied up. Basement."</p>

<p>Mustering up all her courage, Faith went past Buffy and down to the basement. Her eyes
went directly to the man tied in the center of the room, and gagged. This wasn't him. This
wasn't the monster. This was a sickly, stubble-covered, old-looking shell of a man. No
muscle, no fat, she could see the outline of his bones. There were bags under his eyes,
and they were wide with fear. She stood in front of him, bent down, and her fear
evaporated.</p>

<p>"Do you remember me? Daddy?" He moaned into the cloth. "We saved your ass, you know that?</p>

<p>"So tell me, what do you think I should do with you? I mean, I have the power." She looked
to be thinking. "Oh wait. You can't speak. Where are my manners?" She took the gag off.
"Still wondering how I got any. How's prison?" She whispered in his ear. "Do they rape
you? Where do they stick it? Do you like it? Bet the guards beat ya. Got any bruises?
How's it feel? How's it feel?!"</p>

<p>She wanted to hit him so much. So much. But she held back.</p>

<p>"Please..." He croaked.</p>

<p>"Please what? Spare you? Don't worry, Daddy. I will. I wouldn't want to deprive any of the
inmates of their bitch." She chuckled. "But also cause I'm better than you. I see that
now. Say thank you. Come on, say it. Say it!"</p>

<p>"Thank...thank you."</p>

<p>She slapped him across the face, and tears started burning her cheeks. "Not good enough!"
Well, it could've been a lot worse than a slap. "I'm just showin' how much I love you.
Don't you feel loved?"</p>

<p>Buffy came up behind her girlfriend. Watching the family reunion, she could feel Faith's
pain. Her partner was justified in everything she was doing, and Buffy had that same urge
to really wail on the poor excuse for a man. But like Faith, she didn't. Verbal abuse and
a little pain was enough. He was getting some of his own medicine, at least. He deserved
it. Doing serious damage would make them like him, and they weren't.</p>

<p>"We should untie him and call the cops. He's not going anywhere." She said softly.</p>

<p>"See her? She loves me. Even as much as you tried to fuck me up, she loves me. You said no
one else would. I proved you wrong." She looked into his eyes.
"You're not worth my time anymore. You're goin' back to rot in prison, and when you die,
you'll rot in Hell. I leave home this time, and I'll never think about you again."</p>

<p>God, that felt good. Faith didn't feel an ounce of guilt, either. She faced him and saw
what he really was. Without alcohol giving him the boost that made it seem like he was
powerful, to himself and to her, he was just a loser. It gave him a temporary self-esteem
that he never truly had. And she didn't feel sorry for him one bit. She was done.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Hi, Xander...Buffy and Faith? They got in about two hours ago...no, I'll tell them..."
Joyce walked out the front door, and yelled up. "Telephone!"</p>

<p>When she heard her daughter's voice, she hung up and went back inside. She joined her
sister in the living room.</p>

<p>"I called mom and dad. Mom talked to me for a little. Basic stuff. She avoided the issue
even though I could tell she wanted to say something. I got a 'hello' out of dad. We're
making progress." Sarah said.</p>

<p>"When did you do that?"</p>

<p>"Half-an-hour after the girls left. I guess I needed to take the risk. They are family,
right?" She took a deep breath. "But then...Lauren called."</p>

<p>"I heard it ring. What did she say?"</p>

<p>"That she's doing really well, has a nice house...and that she wants me there with her.
She says she's lonely."</p>

<p>"Sounds familiar."</p>

<p>"I told her she could see other people, that I wouldn't mind." Sarah continued on, not
hearing her sister.</p>

<p>"Maybe she doesn't want to. You could have someone really special."</p>

<p>"I know I do. And I'm thinking about it, I guess, but there's work..."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you leave someone in charge here and still work from there?" Joyce asked. "You
weren't considering this before...does it have anything to do with what Buffy and Faith
told you?"</p>

<p>"Not the fact that they're vampire slayers. It's a good thing. I think it's pretty cool
actually, and they obviously know what they're doing. And it doesn't make me love either
of them any less.</p>

<p>"No, just the fact that there are *vampires* is creepy. I'm afraid that I'll just keep
looking behind myself everywhere I go. But honestly, I think this was the excuse I was
waiting for. To give me reason to leave. How many vampires could there be in Hawaii? I'm
not a hundred percent decided yet, so don't hold me to anything."</p>

<p>"Would I do that to you?" Joyce smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Sarah was going.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Yes, Xand. We're in a hot tub...we're a little tense...I am not answering that...Where
are you?...It sounds loud...Vegas?...Tell me you're not blowing all your money...okay,
good...Willow and Oz?...Sleeping...yeah, I think that's what they're doing." Buffy spoke
into the cellular phone as Faith grinned at her. "I'm glad you're having fun...oh, well
you better not keep her waiting then...see ya."</p>

<p>She hung up the phone and stretched her arm out, so she could sit it on the table without
getting out of the tub.</p>

<p>"Think the cops bought the story?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"That you thought he might have returned home, so we went to check, saw him, and then
called 911?" The blonde asked. "Good a story as any. They'll draw they're own conclusions
about the chair and rope, I guess."</p>

<p>"Think they'll suspect us?"</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head. "That detective was the first guy there. He knew there was
something we weren't telling him, but you could tell he didn't think we brought your
father there. He knew to drop it, which was good."</p>

<p>"For us."</p>

<p>"Right." Buffy paused. "Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm not scared of him anymore. We sent him back to where he should be. I feel pretty
good."</p>

<p>"But?"</p>

<p>"But...I can't help thinkin', that if I hadn't met you, I could've turned out just like
him."</p>

<p>"Even if we hadn't met, and I'm really, really glad we did, I know you would've been
different."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure." There was no need to go there though, because she had met Buffy, and
her life was great. Except that she still loved him. She didn't want to, but she did, and
didn't have a choice. "Whatever. I'm just glad you were there tonight."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>Faith waded her way over to Buffy's side of the tub, and they wrapped their arms around
one another. She might love her father, but she loved Buffy a lot more, and everyone else
who was in her life. A life; there was another difference between them. Something he never
had, and something she could have very easily.</p>

<p>"Remember you said there was another way I could get my diploma or somethin'?"</p>

<p>"It's a test. If you pass, you get high school credits."</p>

<p>"When we get back, I'm gonna do it."</p>

<p>"Then we could get Willow to...no, that's kinda wrong."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I was gonna say that she could hack into the Registrar's Office at the college and enroll
you so we could go at the same time."</p>

<p>"As far as wrong things go, that's pretty low on the scale, B."</p>

<p>"Hmm...you're right." Faith kissed her. "I suppose you think this'll finish the job of
getting me over to your side."</p>

<p>"Uh huh."</p>

<p>"Well I'm already there. But only cause I think you look incredibly sexy in a bikini."</p>

<p>Faith smirked. "It comes naturally. So does 'I love you'."</p>

<p>"Aren't you just adorable?" Buffy teased. "Love you too, honey."</p>

<p>The Bostonian narrowed her eyes. "That was a sappy moment. I don't have many, so don't
tell anybody."</p>

<p>"Never." The blonde winked. "This is gonna sound corny, maybe bordering on sappy, but I
feel tied to you, and I don't ever want to lose that feeling."</p>

<p>Gripping one another in a tight embrace, they stayed in that position for several seconds,
the comfort of being close, enough. However, then their biological functions kicked in.</p>

<p>"This water's supposed to relax me, right?" Faith grinned. "Then how come I feel so hot?"</p>

<p>"It is a HOT tub, Faith."</p>

<p>"Just go with me on this, B." Faith sighed.</p>

<p>"Um...k." Buffy said, touching Faith's forehead and using her best, 'fake worry' voice.
"You're burning up. Oh no. Whatever shall we do?"</p>

<p>"I think I should dry off. Might need some help, though."</p>

<p>"I can do that."</p>
