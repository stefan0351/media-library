<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Twelve -->

<p>Brooke woke Sam early the next morning for a breakfast of waffles and cream. Sam stumbled down the stairs groggily.</p>
<p>"Come and get it, Sammy," Brooke called to the still sleepy girl yawning at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>"What? No breakfast in bed?" Sam joked as she sat down. Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"Maybe later, if you're lucky," she teased. Sam's eyebrows wagged as she smiled at Brooke and dug into the waffles.</p>
<p>"Mmmmm, Brooke, these are good," she sighed as she chewed. Brooke grinned.</p>
<p>"Thanks, I opened the box myself," she joked.</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate it tastes fantastic," Sam repeated around a mouthful. "So what?s on the agenda for today?" Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"Whatever you feel like, Sam. It?s your vacation," she responded. Sam thought for a minute.</p>
<p>"Well, I would like to see if I remember how to ski," she said. "Interested?"</p>
<p>"You bet," Brooke nodded. "We?ll head to town after breakfast and make a day of it, OK?"</p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan, Stan," Sam chirped as she poured an obscene amount of cream on her waffles.</p>
<p>"Sam! Want some waffles with your cream?" Brooke teased. Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"Eh, if I must," she sighed dramatically. Brooke reached across the table to wipe a spot of cream from the corner of Sam?s mouth. They both froze as they realized what she was doing.</p>
<p>"You uh?have some cream?there," Brooke stuttered, drawing her hand away. Sam stared at her, keeping her features schooled blank. Her heart had fluttered wildly when she saw Brooke reaching out to her. Without thinking, she licked the cream off her cheek. Brooke looked away. That image was almost too much for her.</p>
<p>"So, uhm?after breakfast, why don?t you get cleaned up and then we?ll go into town? We?ll check out the slopes for a bit and when we get tired or hungry we can check out the town," Brooke suggested as she cleared her own plate. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The day progressed well for the two of them. It didn?t take long for Sam to get the hang of skiing again and before long she was hitting the slopes along side Brooke. They spent most of the afternoon racing each other down the hill, challenging the other and having a lot of fun. Around mid-afternoon though, Sam?s stomach made it?s presence known.</p>
<p>"Ah, I take it the fuel tank is empty?" Brooke joked upon hearing a particularly loud rumble from Sam?s direction. Sam blushed and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I think we should get lunch soon."</p>
<p>"OK. I know a great steak house about a mile from here. Wanna check it out? Afterward we can either check out the town or head back to the house," Brooke suggested.</p>
<p>"House please. I?m chilled to the bone and I can just hear that hot tub calling my name," Sam sighed in thought. "I just want to slip into the hot water and soak away any aches and pains I may have caused myself." Brooke tried to ignore the wonderful imagery Sam just supplied her with but to no avail. Pictures of Sam reclining in the hot tub in her bathing suit, or possibly sans suit floated through her mind and caused a flush to rise to her cheeks.</p>
<p>"You OK, Brooke?" Sam asked when Brooke closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Brooke opened her eyes surprised that she?d lost herself that far in her daydream and nodded embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I?m fine. Just thinking. Come on, let?s turn in our skis and go eat."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole paced the package claim booth seething. Lily almost swore she could see smoke coming from the petite blonde?s ears. She had no idea what could have Nicole so riled up.</p>
<p>&lt;Unless there?s something here that I?m not clued into&gt; she thought to herself. &lt;Is there something going on between Sam and Brooke? Or is it just a product of Nicole?s paranoid imagination? I?m going to have to pay close attention to this one&gt;</p>
<p>"We went from LA to here on ONE PLANE! How can you lose a bag when we only took ONE PLANE?" Nicole screeched. "And why does it have to be my bag?" she added quieter and somewhat defeated. She was absolutely sure now that someone was out to get her, to stop her from getting to Sam before Brooke turned her head. There was too much going wrong for her to think otherwise.</p>
<p>"Relax Nic, they?ll find it," Josh said happily as he looked around. "Not like it could have gone anywhere."</p>
<p>"Here?s your bag, Miss. Sorry for the delay," the baggage clerk chirped cheerfully. "Your shuttle is waiting to take you to the address you specified. You should reach it by nightfall." Nicole groaned.</p>
<p>"Nightfall. By then, who knows what may have happened," she complained to herself.</p>
