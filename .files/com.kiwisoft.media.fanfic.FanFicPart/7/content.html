<p align=center>Past the road to your house<br>
That you never called home<br>
Where they turned out your lights<br>
Though they say you'll never know</p>

<p align=center>I remember running through the wet grass<br>
And failing a step behind<br>
Both of us never tiring<br>
Desperately wanting</p>

<p align=center>When they pumped out your guts<br>
And filled you full of those pills<br>
You were never quite right<br>
Deserving all the chills<br>
They say the worst is over<br>
Kicked it over and ran<br>
Then they ask what went wrong<br>
When they turn you on again<br>
They turn you on again.</p>

<p align=center>Kick them right in the face<br>
Make them wish they weren't born<br>
And if they bring up your name<br>
Well they'll say you won the war.<br>
Baby burst in the world<br>
Never given a chance<br>
Then they ask what went wrong<br>
When you never had it right</p>

<p align=center>Oh the letters have dropped off<br>
Though they say you got them all<br>
I finally figured out some things you'll never know.<br>
Take back your life and let me inside<br>
We'll find the door if you care to anymore.</p>

<p align=center>I remember running through the wet grass<br>
and falling a step behind<br>
Both of us never tiring<br>
Desperately Wanting.</p>

<p align=center>"Desperately Wanting" ~ Better Than Ezra</p>

<p>Buffy drove her mothers Jeep up the Pacific Coast Highway while listening to
the radio. She thought of all that 'desperately wanted' and didn't
accomplish in her life thus far. Granted she was only a sophomore in
college on summer vacation, but she was also the slayer. She couldn't leave
too many loose ends when the time came; Not that she was expecting it soon
but she did have to be a realist. She looked at the slumbering redhead to
her right, thinking about other things she wanted in her life. She didn't
want that to be a loose end. That was the one she was going to face very
soon. One thing just ate at her though... Did she leave the lock the door
to her mothers house? Hmm... wasn't Xander the last one out of the house?
 With her mother being out of Sunnydale this week also, she couldn't chance
it.</p>

<p>Xander, sleeping soundly in the back seat was spastically beaten awake by
the passenger next to him.</p>

<p>"Wha... Joy? stop it... Ow! Quit that." He said grabbing the hand that
was poking him.</p>

<p>"He's awake." The obvious statement coming from the back seat to the
driver.</p>

<p>"Thank you Anya," Buffy said with an amused tone. "Xander, did you lock my
front door before we left?"</p>

<p>"That's what you woke me up for? Yeah, I remember locking the door. Man, I
was having this great dream about Buffy's mom, and she was lick... uhhh...
 never mind, I wasn't dreaming about anything, other than cute cuddly bears
and Anya...." Xander finished lamely after Anya began to glare at him.</p>

<p>"All right..... After we have concluded that portion of our trip, I'd like
to be the first to say eww. Xander, that's my mother! Ewww... And
secondly, we're about forty-five minutes from the house." Buffy informed
the group that was currently awake.</p>

<p>"You know, when we get back, remind me to thank Giles again for arranging
this get away for us. I know that, I for one, needed this little trip.
That whole First Slayer thing invading my head... Who'd of thought Giles
had connections to a pad by the beach?"</p>

<p>"I'm just glad to have to week off from slaying. A week a friends, fun,
sun, and sand away from the hellmouth, what more could a girl want?" Buffy
finished with a small smile as she looked at her companion in the passenger
seat.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>After carrying the groceries and overnight bags into the house, they each
explored the place. This ended with them splitting into two groups. Xander
and Anya disappeared into one of the bedrooms while Buffy and Willow went to
check out the other one.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I could sleep for a week," groaned Buffy as she threw
herself on her bed in the master bedroom of the cottage. There were two
bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, in the furnished house complete with a
main living area, a kitchen with a dining area, and a patio with furniture.
All in all not too bad for the ocean front home.</p>

<p>"Seeing as how you just drove us five hours to get here, anyone would be
tired. But I'd think you might want to enjoy the beach, no sleep your time
away here." Willow said leaning the door frame.</p>

<p>"Well, you're only saying that because you and Xander got to sleep on the
way here. I was stuck listening to Anya rant about humans in general. And
then Xander woke up to tell me his dream about my mother. My mother! Fun,
let me tell you." Buffy stated as she flung her arm over her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry about that." Willow said as she crossed the room to the
large king size bed to sit down at the foot. "But if you feel like joining
the land of the living with me, I'm going to scout out the place and
area...."</p>

<p>Buffy glanced at Willow over her bent arm, thought about the quality Willow
time this would mean. No hellmouth, no commandos, no Riley, no Tara. Just
them. She then rolled into a sitting position and smiled.</p>

<p>"I guess I can't let you go out there without someone with you...." Buffy
left off knowing Willow had her hook, line and sinker.</p>

<p>The now beaming redhead stood, grabbed the slayer's hand, and pulled her
into a standing position.</p>

<p>"I knew I could count on my slayer"</p>

<p>"Well, shucks ma'am, I'm only doing my duty as a good citizen." Buffy said,
doing her best impersonation of a cowboy. Letting the redhead lead her out
of the house by her hand, she couldn't think of just how lucky she was to
have Willow in her life. Then she thought that this walk may be the time to
tell her that.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Buffy and Willow had walked around the surrounding area for about a hour.
They figured that they would eat dinner in about two hours, so they still
had meandering time left.   They were currently walking up and down the
beach arguing over who'd win in a fight, Scooby or Snoopy.</p>

<p>"I'm telling ya, Scooby's a whimp.  Snoopy would be all over him."</p>

<p>"No, he's not a whimp.  Scooby's resourceful, Snoopy is not.  So
therefore..."  Willow started to say.</p>

<p>"Are you saying that Charlie Browns' dogs ins't resourceful?" Buffy said
cutting off Willow. "Will, have you ever read the comics, all he is...  is
resourceful.  He's the most resourceful dog, ever.  Scooby would go run
hiding like.... like Xander."  She finished up with a smile.</p>

<p>"But, Scooby is a Scoob!  The's the Scoob.  He's Scooby."</p>

<p>"You know, that really help you any."  The smirking Buffy knew she had won.</p>

<p>This prompted Willow to use the "tongue defense" and stuck hers out at
Buffy.  This and the way Willow moved her hands to the side of her head, and
then proceeded to stick her thumbs in her ears and wiggle her fingers, made
Buffy laugh at her sudden regression.</p>

<p>"That didn't either, but I forgive ya."  The smiling Buffy started looking
around at the small dock they were near and the rocks that we're near it.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"  The redhead went after her friend that had just
started walking those rocks.</p>

<p>"I used to come to the beach with my parents when I was little.  There were
the huge rocks that none of the kids could stay standing on.  I was one of
the few who could.  It was really slippery and wet."</p>

<p>Buffy started to walk on these rocks, getting about twelve feet out.</p>

<p>"Well, things tend to get slightly slippery when they are wet.  That doesn't
mean you should go out mounting these wet things and try to stay upright
while doing it."</p>

<p>"Eh, are you trying to belittle this?"  Buffy turned to look at Willow to
tell her what she had just said, when she lost her footing on the rock.</p>

<p>Buffy found out that the water temperature was warm, having slipped of some
algae that was growing on the shore rocks.  This explained her current
state, completely soaked.  Thus the reason their walk was cut short.</p>

<p>"It's not funny.  I could have been hurt."  Buffy was starting to get cold
as the slight breeze hit her wet clothes.</p>

<p>"I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you."  Willow snickered at her
dripping friend holding back as much as she could.  They were still about
ten minutes from the house.</p>

<p>"All right, that's it."  Buffy then took off running at the redhead.</p>

<p>"Buffy! I was joking, see all in good fun.."  Willow said as she took off
toward the house.  Alas, she was no match for the slayer, and Buffy had her
down in the sand in no time.  They wrestled around until Willow was flat on
her back while Buffy leaned over her and held Willows hands at her sides.</p>

<p>"Buffy!  Now I'm all wet!  See what you did?"  The inner Id in Buffy was
going nuts at everything Willow kept saying and doing.  Willow really
couldn't be doing all that on purpose, could she?</p>

<p>"I think that was my goal.  And now that I have accomplished that, I'm going
to take a shower."  Buffy let go of Willows hands and started to walk
towards the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, no you don't."  Willow then proceeded to run after her and jump on the
slayers back.  "For that, you owe me a  ride back."</p>

<p>Laughing at her friends exuberance, she repositioned Willow's placement  and
took off running in the sand.</p>

<p>"Hey, where'd the party go?"  Xander asked when he noticed the absence of
his two friends.</p>

<p>"Maybe their out making their orgasms?"  Anya, who was in the kitchen
finding something to eat, walked out of the door into the main room.</p>

<p>"Anya, I told you, it's not polite to talk about orgasms when my friends are
about."  Xander explained hopping she would drop it.</p>

<p>"I don't understand the human aversion not to talk about something you all
have and do."</p>

<p>"Buffy and Willow have been gone for a while, maybe we should go look for
them."  Xander, trying to ignore what she was saying, began to look out the
front windows.</p>

<p>"They've been gone a hour....  Whatever.  Come on."  She grabbed his hand
and lead him into out the door when he looked at her with a plaintive look.
They both saw Buffy coming up to the house carrying Willow on her back.</p>

<p>"Hey guys.  Could ya move out of the way?  I have this feeling that I have
the weight of the world on my shoulders and ow!"  Buffy made her way to the
door as Willow pinched Buffy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm not that heavy."</p>

<p>"You're not that heavy Willow, what on Earth was I thinking."  Smirking, she
dropped Willow on the couch and headed to take a shower.</p>

<p>"Don't fall on the slippery tile, now!"  Willow called after the blonde
getting a muffled "smart ass" in reply.</p>

<p>Xander and Anya back into the house where Anya stated that Willow and Buffy
were indeed found.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the info there Anya, I would have been completely lost without
you."</p>

<p>"No problem."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at them and asked what they wanted to do for the rest of the
night after she and Buffy got cleaned up.  Xander, cutting off Anya's reply,
said that food was in order and then they should just go wherever the group
wanted after diner.</p>

<p>Willow agreed with him and headed toward the bedroom her shared with Buffy
to wait for her shower there.  She wondered about the days events.  When
they were on their walk, Buffy would sometimes trail off or just stop
talking.  Then there were a few times where Willow would look at her,
catching Buffy staring at her and Buffy would then look down or at something
else.  And it looked like Buffy would often open her mouth to say something,
but she wouldn't.  All in all, Buffy was behaving oddly, even for her.  It
had been happening more often lately and Willow was determined to find out
what was happening.  She thought that this void was opening between them.
Buffy could tell her anything, what was the slayer hiding from her?</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Lying on the bed, Willow was still lost in thought when Buffy walked into
the room.  After hearing the bathroom door open, she looked up to see the
blonde clad in a blue terrycloth robe.</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm guessing your done?"</p>

<p>"Yeah Will, it's all yours.  Oh, anyone decide on where we're going to eat
tonight?  I saw this place on the drive up that looked like it could be
pretty good.  I think it was called 'Dak's Grill'."</p>

<p>Willow got up from the bed to stand while Buffy looked through her bag to
get something to wear for that evening.</p>

<p>"Well, I know I haven't thought of anything yet and I don't think that
Xander or Anya have left the house since we got here, so I say we try it."
Willow left the bed to retrieve her bathroom essentials that were currently
in her bag.</p>

<p>"Alright, I'll go ask them while you finish up."  Buffy said while laying
her clothes on the bed.</p>

<p>Willow then proceeded to the bathroom to stop, turn, and look at her best
friend.</p>

<p>"Uh, Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Yeah Will?" The blond turned to look at Willow wondering what she wanted.
The was an uncertainty in the red heads eyes that made her slightly uneasy.</p>

<p>"If there was anything wrong....  You'd tell me, right?" <Damn. I guess your
not as slick as you thought you were, huh Buffy.  What do I do now?> The
blonde thought to herself.</p>

<p>"Yeah, of course.  Why do ya think think there is?"  &lt;She's evading the
question.  She's hiding something...  what can't she tell me?&gt;  Willow
looked at the ground as she remembered the reason behind their distance this
year was from too many secrets.</p>

<p>"Well, you have been sort of... reserved the past couple of weeks, more so
lately.  Is it... I mean did I..  If I did anything to upset you, I'd like
to know.  You can tell me..."  Willow was cut off by Buffy's hand on her
upper arm.  She looked up to meet Buffy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Will, it's not anything you did.  Don't worry about it.  It will be over
soon enough.  &lt;Then you'll go running away, screaming and cursing my name.&gt;
Buffy thought with a sad smile.</p>

<p>Willow saw this and immediately said, "I don't want to push you.  It's just
that after everything that has happened...  I thought we said secrets were
bad, and there should be no more of them...  I just want you to know that no
matter what, I'm here for you Buffy."</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes started to tear up as she pulled Willow into a hug.  When they
parted, Buffy looked at her and said, "Will, I know your here.  It will be
over soon.  I promise."</p>

<p>Knowing that Buffy was sincere, Willow slightly nodded and walked into the
bathroom while Buffy looked after her.</p>

<p><Way to go.  Now she thinks you're keeping things from her....  Well, you
are...  Whatever.  I'm going to tell her.  Tonight...>  Buffy thought as she
had a determined look in her eyes.</p>

<p>
Willow walked into the bathroom with her bag and closed the door.  Leaning
against it, she sighed and thought about what just happened.  She did trust
Buffy, that wasn't the issue.  She was just worried about her slayer.  Buffy
kept things bottled in, and Willow didn't like that.  She wanted to be the
person Buffy would come to when the blonde was scared, cold, happy or sad.
Willow wanted Buffy to know that she didn't have to face it all alone.
Willow wanted Buffy to know that someone would always look out for her.
Care about her.  Mend her.  Love her.  Willow wanted Buffy.</p>

<p>
After Willow's shower, they had all met in the main sitting room to discuss
the plans for that evening.  Buffy had told Xander and Anya about the
restaurant and they had agreed to going.</p>

<p>"You know, I figured after dinner we would just walk the beach...  Unless of
course you ladies would rather do something else."  Xander addressed the
group from his spot on the couch. Anya was on it with him while Willow was
in the chair and Buffy stood behind it.</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me."  <Hmm, sand + ocean + light breeze + moonlight +
Willow = secret telling and either the best or worse day of my life> thought
the blonde slayer.</p>

<p>"Me too." Willow chimed in.</p>

<p>"I don't understand the point of it.  We will just get all..."  Anya trailed
off as Xander whispered something in her ear. "... Okay, I'm going." She
finished with a smile.</p>

<p>"Okayyyy..."  Buffy said drawing out the word. "I don't want to even know.
Everyone, come on, food awaits us."</p>

<p>"Food."</p>

<p>"Food is good."</p>

<p>"And, after we eat then Xander an I can go and.."  Anya was then cut off by
the hand that currently covered her mouth.  A hand that belonged to Xander.</p>

<p>"Please don't finish that."  He pleaded and let go.</p>

<p>"Ewww." and "I second that." were the following replies as they walked out
the door to the Jeep.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Walking into the restaurant, the foursome noticed the beach theme.  The
decor was basically fishing nets and old buoys while the names of each item
of food had a word added to it to match the theme.  After getting seated in
a booth, they looked at the menus while the waiter came to take their drink
order and point out the special of the Pelican Pouch with Foggy Fries.  They
ordered their respective drinks and waited for the water to come back to
place their orders.</p>

<p>"I can't believe have of the things they have on the menu...  Come on, the
'Surf's Up Salad?'"  Buffy shook her head as she read the menu.</p>

<p>"I think it's kinda nice...  in that corny way, but its still fun."</p>

<p>"Will, you think researching is fun."  Xander pointed out as he looked
across the table at Buffy and Willow.</p>

<p>"At least I have fun."  Then Willow promptly stuck her tongue out at him.</p>

<p>"I have fun...  Anya and I went mini golfing last week."</p>

<p>"You mean you dragged me out of the house to hit a ball with a metal stick
and chase after it until it went into a little hole?"  Anya asked looking up
from her menu.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that was fun."  He tried to counter her.</p>

<p>"After it was.  That is only because competition makes you..." She was yet
cut off by Buffy announcing the waiter had arrived to take their orders.</p>

<p>"Alright, what can I get ya?"  The water asked pen and paper poised.</p>

<p>"Umm, I'll have a Beach Burger Platter with no onions." Buffy said giving
him the menu.</p>

<p>"Same here." Followed Willow.</p>

<p>"Me too... but no tomatoes."</p>

<p>"Full rack of Captain Bart's BBQ rib's, and side of fries."  Xander said
passing his and Anya's menus.</p>

<p>"Alright.... Three BBP's, two no onions, one no tomatoes, one rack of ribs,
and a side of fries....  Is that all?"  The waiter asked looking up from his
pad.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's everything."  Buffy said speaking for the group.</p>

<p>"Okay.  It'll be about ten to fifteen minutes.  Anything else you guys
need?"  Buffy read the nametag on his shirt.   It said 'Griffen.'</p>

<p>"Nope, we'll call you over if we need anything."  Buffy said to Griffen.
Then he turned and took the order to the cook.</p>

<p>"I'll have to go to the ladies room, I'll be back in a second."  Willow said
getting up after he left.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go with you."   Anya stood up with Willow and they walked off.</p>

<p>"I don't get why girls have to go in groups...” Xander began looking after
them.</p>

<p>"Xander, it's just one of those things....  Where did that come from?  One
of the things of what.  Which one of those things?  What things? Why only
one?  Argh."</p>

<p>She stopped as a waitress brought the drinks to the table.  After she was
gone, Xander looked back to Buffy.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I really don't think it's that deep...  speaking of deep, what's
going on between you and Willow?"  This question caused Buffy's eyes to jump
to his in shock.</p>

<p>"What do you mean Xander?"  Her eyes grew suspicious as she looked at him.</p>

<p>"You know what I'm talking about.  You're both my best friends, you didn't
think I'd notice Buff?" He looked at her incredulously.</p>

<p>"Notice what exactly?"</p>

<p>"That you have a thing for Will."</p>

<p>"I don't have a thing for will...." Xander then cut her off.</p>

<p>"Don't lie to me Buff."</p>

<p>"...It's more like an obsession.  I'm in love with her." She continued from
where she left off.</p>

<p>"Wow...  What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to have to tell her.  She wants complete honesty in out
friendship...  I've been sorta distant lately, and she noticed this."</p>

<p>"So when are you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"I was planning on doing it tonight....  That way she cant shut me out
forever."</p>

<p>"She's sorta a captive audience here?"  He pointed down at the ground.</p>

<p>"Bingo, that was another reason for this little get away."</p>

<p>"Well...  I think it will go good, she won't go nuts or anything."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"  She questioned him.</p>

<p>"She's Willow Rosenberg, that's how.  I hope everything goes well for both
of ya." He said with a slight smile.</p>

<p>"Thanks Xander, this... it means a lot."  She smiled up at him.</p>

<p>"No problem... but if you want to thank me in other ways... like pictures,
or me joining the festivities, I want you to know I'm totally okay with
that."  He smirked at her.</p>

<p>"Xander!"  Buffy glared at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"Just kidding Buff.  Anya is enough for any man."</p>

<p>"Don't go there."  She said holding up her hands in a stop motion.</p>

<p>"Alright, hey is that our food?"  He said looking over at the tray of food
Griffen was carrying their way.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and there is Will and Anya too."</p>

<p>Griffen came and put their food in the respective places and refilled their
drinks.  When he left, Anya and Willow arrived at the table.</p>

<p>"Don't ya just love it when you come back and your food is here waiting on
you?"  Willow smiled as she sat down.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's great Will."  Xander smiled at her taking a bite.</p>

<p>"So, what are we doing after this?"  A bored looking Anya asked the
question.</p>

<p>"I think we're going to hang out at the beach."  Xander smiled and looked up
at Buffy as he said that before looking a Willow and Anya for their
opinions.</p>

<p>"Yeah, good choice Xander."  She smiled back at him and then took a bite of
her food.</p>

<p>"That might not be bad."  Anya said, with a gleam in her eye thinking back
at what Xander told her before they left.  This was the same gleam in
Xander's eye.</p>

<p>"It sounds like a plan, then."  Willow agreed thinking that it would be a
good of a place as any to talk to her less than forthcoming best friend.
They all began to finish eating randomly talking about nothing and thinking
about what the next few hours would bring them.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>After their dinner, they went to the house to drop off the car, and began to
aimlessly wonder about the beach.  Currently Anya was talking about one of
her many memories from her life as a vengeance demon to a very uncomfortable
looking Willow.  Buffy and Xander were walking a few yards behind them
talking.</p>

<p>"So Buffster...  what do you plan on telling her?"  Xander looked over to
Buffy as she looked out over the ocean waves.</p>

<p>"I honestly don't know.  I'll just tell her the truth...  Or, maybe I
shouldn't.  I mean, what if she freaks?  What if-"   Buffy was cut off by
Xander putting his hand on her shoulder and turning her toward him.</p>

<p>"Buff.  Hold on there.  We both know that Willow isn't going to freak."</p>

<p>"I know.  But it's not fair for me to tell her.  "</p>

<p>"Why?  I thought you two ladies didn't want to keep anything from each other
anymore.  I mean, I could be wrong, but I think it's not fair to her if you
don't tell her."  He looked at her with almost pleading eyes.  She caved.</p>

<p>"Alright.  Alright.  I get it."</p>

<p>"I just want you to be happy, Buff."  He put his arm around her shoulders in
his friendly manner.</p>

<p>"I know.  Thanks."  She smiled up to him.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd better get back to Anya before she frightens Wills any more.  And
we can't have a scared Wills, now can we?"  Buffy laughed at his remark and
they made their way up to where Willow and Anya were.</p>

<p>"...And then I took away any reason for him to want to have-"  Anya was cut
off by an anxious looking Willow.</p>

<p>"Buffy!  Xander!  I'm so glad to see you both.  Where have you been?  Was it
interesting? Tell me it was..." She had a pleading look in her eyes while
she quickly moved away from Anya.</p>

<p>"Hey Will."  Buffy smirk at Willow's behavior.</p>

<p>"Sorry for taking so long Wills.  I'm sure Anya was good company for you,
right Ahn?"  Xander grabbed his girlfriends' hand and smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Right, I was just telling her-"  Anya was cut off by Willow.  A very scared
looking Willow.</p>

<p>"Buffy!  Can I talk to you?  Over there?"  Willow accompanied that question
with a head jerk, pointing in the direction they had just come from.</p>

<p>"You got something wrong with your neck, there Wills?"  Xander looked at her
with a smirk.</p>

<p>Willow looked stricken from the thought of having staying any longer around
Anya.  "No, I uh, I just need to talk.  With Buffy.  Generally you talk to
other people.  I usually have conversations even.  I don't talk to myself.
'Cause that might be considered crazy.  And I'm not crazy, so I talk to
people.  Buffy even."  Buffy took pity on the girl and grabbed her hand.</p>

<p>"Come on, Will.  Lets go."  As they left Buffy glared Xander with a smirk.</p>

<p>"What was her problem?"  Anya turned to her boyfriend when Buffy and Willow
were out of ear shot.</p>

<p>"I have no idea Ahn.  No idea."  He looked after the two girls with a
knowing smile.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"So,  whatcha guys talk about?" Buffy looked at Willow with a grin.</p>

<p>"I don't want to re-live that..."  A frown began to form on the red heads
face.</p>

<p>"Poor Willow."  Buffy wanted, more than anything, to see her smile.  She put
her arm around Willow's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yeah, poor Willow."  Willow leaned her head on the blonde's shoulder.</p>

<p>A few moments of silence passed as the girls basked in their closeness.
Willow then lifted her head and turned to stand in front of the slayer.</p>

<p>"Buff?"</p>

<p>"Yeah Will?"  Buffy looked up at her with a questioning glace.</p>

<p>"You said before that you'd let me in on whatever is going on...  It's now
later..."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Oh?  That's it?  Just Oh?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Willow."  Buffy was looking at the ground, pushing the sand with
her shoe.  "I just...  It's hard."</p>

<p>"What hard?  Tell me Buff.  I want to be able to help you, but I can't do
that if you don't let me."</p>

<p>"Well, you see...  That's sorta the point, Will..."</p>

<p>"My wanting to help is bothering you?"  Buffy looked at Willow when she said
this and saw the wounded look in her eyes.  Guiding Willow, she sat them
both on two big rocks, facing each other.</p>

<p>"No, it's not that.  I mean, It's just...   Well, you've been help me, been
there for me, ever since I met you.  You've been the best friend I never
thought I'd be lucky enough to have.  I'm desperately wanting to repay you
for everything you have given me, Will.  What I'm basically saying is...  is
that...  Willow Rosenberg..."</p>

<p>"Yeah?"  Willow looked at the tears forming in Buffy's eyes with confusion,
but a grin was forming on her face.</p>

<p>"What I'm saying is...  what's that?"</p>

<p>"What's what?"  Willow looked Buffy with a growing confused expression.</p>

<p>"That! Over there in the water...  Is that...  Are those dolphins?"</p>

<p>Still trying to see where Buffy was looking, Willow asked, "Where?"</p>

<p>"Over there."  Buffy pointed out into the ocean.  Willow looked to the spot
and saw a family of dolphins jumping out of the water and playing around.</p>

<p>"Oh.  Yeah, it looks like dolphins."  Willow said with an awed smile.</p>

<p>"Wow, that's amazing."  Buffy had the same smile on her face.  Then she
mumbled, "Almost as amazing as you, Will."</p>

<p>Not hearing that last part, Willow turned to Buffy said, "It is...  Now,
what were you going to say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, right."  Buffy was still looking out at the ocean.</p>

<p>"Come on Buff..."  Willow pleaded with the slayer with her eyes when Buffy
turned to look at her.</p>

<p>"Alright."  Buffy to a deep breath to calm herself and began again.  </p>

<p>"Willow...  I guess there's not a better way to say this than to just come
out and say it....  so here it goes.  Will, I think you're the smartest,
most beautiful, most amazing person I've ever known.  There just aren't
enough words to describe the wonder that is you.  I guess it's really no
wonder that this has happened.  I-I...  I've..  I've fallen in love with
you."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"What?"  The redhead looked at Buffy.  She must have misunderstood the
slayer.  She couldn't have said what Willow thought she did, could she?</p>

<p>Buffy hesitated after hearing that.  Dropping Willow's hand, she stared at
the ground beside her. "I'm in love with you, Will.  I don't know how it
happened, it just sorta did.     I was...  I don't know.  I thought..."
Cutting herself off, she abruptly stood up.  "I'm sorry," she whispered, and
then turned towards the house.</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped in her retreat.  She turned to look at Willow, whose eyes were now glistening.</p>

<p>"You love me?  You're in love with me?"  Willow took a step toward the
blonde.  Buffy looked down at the sand and replied,  "Yeah."</p>

<p>Willow could feel tears start to descend on her cheeks while, in shock, she
whispered, "Wow."  This caused Buffy to look up at Willow through the tears
in her own eyes.</p>

<p>"Wow?"  She questioned, taking a timid step toward her dream.</p>

<p>"Wow."  Willow confirmed, nodding.</p>

<p>"I think I broke you..." Buffy trailed off, smiling and wiping her face.</p>

<p>"No.  Not broken, just processing new information."</p>

<p>"Okay.  I'll go so you can process this, then."  Buffy said, again trying to
make a retreat after losing her initial courage.</p>

<p>"No!  I mean...  No."  Willow stepped forward and reached out and grabbed the
blondes' hand.</p>

<p>"No?"  Buffy said, looking down at their joined hands.</p>

<p>"No, stay.  It's just a lot to take in all at once; But don't leave."  She
looked at Buffy with pleading eyes.</p>

<p>"You sure?"  Buffy didn't want to make her friend anymore uncomfortable than
it seemed she already had.  The look on Willow's face told a different
story.</p>

<p>"I've never been so sure of anything in my life."  Buffy wiped a stray tear
from her eye, just as they seemed like they were going to start back up
again.  Willow guided them both back to the rocks that they had sat on
before.</p>

<p>Taking their seats, Buffy began, "Alright.  Willow, I-" She was cut off by
Willow standing up in front of her, then kneeling down so that her face was
level with Buffys'.  "Willow?"  Buffy questioned, looking at the strange
look the redhead had in her eyes.</p>

<p>Then Willow cupped Buffy's chin, and seeing whatever she had wanted to see
in the blondes eyes, Willow began to slowly lean her face down to Buffy's.
Seeing this, Buffy was shocked, but that quickly went away as she felt
Willow's lips brush against her own. She closed her eyes and leaned into the
kiss.</p>

<p>Pulling apart, Willow looked at Buffy to see if she was okay with this new
development.  She saw the slightly dazed grin on her face and leaned in for
another, which was readily returned.</p>

<p>"Wow."  The redhead said, after pulling themselves apart once more.</p>

<p>"Yeah."  Looking at the girl in front of her with the silliest grin on her
face and tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I think I love you."  Willow said as she began wiping away Buffy's tears
with the pad of her thumb.</p>

<p>"Really?"  Buffy leaned into the touch, looking up at Willow.</p>

<p>"Yeah."  Willow wrapped her arms around her waist, directing Buffy's head to
rest on her shoulder. "Really."  She whispered as she looked out at the
ocean over her love's head.  Smiling, she kissed the blond hair.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>After watching the waves crash on the shore, while holding Buffy in her
arms, Willow realized that this was it.  Happiness.  At least, this was her
version of it.  Being here, with Buffy…  This was what life was about, these
little moments.  Moments like these were what people lived for.  And there
she was, Willow Rosenberg, 19 years old, and sophomore in college, having
one of those moments.  Her hold on the blonde tightened as she thought about
how long it took to get here.  She wouldn’t have changed any of it though,
not one bit.</p>

<p>Buffy was looking at the night sky.  There were so many stars.  She was in
awe.  The stars didn’t cause this feeling, although on any other night, they
would have.  The reason she felt like this was because of the person she was
leaning next to.  Willow.  Her Willow.  She couldn’t believe that this had
happened.  She couldn’t remember being this happy and content in a long
time.  She noticed the arms around her tighten just a bit and up to see
Willow looking at the ocean.</p>

<p>“Will?”</p>

<p>“Hmm?”  Willow looked down to see she was being stared at.</p>

<p>“Whatcha thinking?”</p>

<p>“About you… how this all feels like a dream.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know what you mean.”  Buffy reached up and kissed her.    After
they pulled apart, Buffy jumped up, and then reached out her hand to help
Willow up.</p>

<p>Smiling at her odd behavior, Willow asked Buffy, “Where are we going?”</p>

<p>“Well, I just kinda…  Well, we were supposed to go for a walk, remember?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah…” Willow reached up to take the offered hand and was pulled up to
her feet.  Buffy kept her hand in Willow’s as she began to walk away.</p>

<p>“Wait.”</p>

<p>“What?”  Buffy turned back to face her wondering why Willow hadn’t moved.</p>

<p>“Just wanted to give you this.” Willow reached out and put her hand on
Buffy’s cheek, then leaned in to kiss her, wrapping her other arm around
Buffy’s neck.</p>

<p>The passion they felt flare in them as they kissed was mind blowing, and
Buffy put her arms around Willow to keep them steady.  Willow opened her
mouth slightly to take in Buffy’s bottom lip, gently sucking on it.  Buffy
groaned into her mouth, and then gently pushed her tongue to meet with
Willow’s.  After dueling which each other, they parted from the lack of
oxygen.  Smiling at each other, they linked hands and began to walk down by
the shore.  Nothing was said; there was no need for it.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>They walked for a while, just being in each other’s company.  Even though
they didn’t want this night to end, they had to go to sleep soon.  They
wanted to be able to use every second of the next day, so that meant that
they had to be well rested.  When they walked into the house they saw that
Xander was in the kitchen getting a snack while Anya looked on.</p>

<p>“Xander, how can you be hungry?  Didn’t we just eat a few hours ago?”  Buffy
asked looking at him as if he grew another head.</p>

<p>“See, it was hours ago.  Besides, I’m still a growing boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have seen him grow.  I’d like him to grow larger and more often.”
Anya looked please with herself while to others looked at the interesting
paint on the wall.</p>

<p>“Umm…  I’m going to go to bed now.  Goodnight.” Willow made her way to the
room she shared with Buffy trying to get the images of Xander “growing” out
of her head.</p>

<p>“I’ll think I’ll join you Will.  G’ night Xand, Anya.” She started off in
the same direction Willow went, but a voice stopped her.</p>

<p>“Night Buffy.  Oh hey, did ya have a nice, uh…  walk?”  Xander asked her
with a small grin.</p>

<p>“Yes, Xander.  It was nice.”  She returned the grin and then she walked out
of the room.</p>

<p>“Did I say something not appealing to them?”  Anya asked him, confused about
what had just happened.  <Humans…  very odd species.></p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>When Buffy walked in, Willow was getting her pajamas out of her bag.  Buffy
went to do the same, thinking about what it would be like to sleep next to
Willow.  Sure, she had done it before…  But that was before.  Things had
changed, and this was going to be new and different.  <A good different.></p>

<p>While Buffy became lost in thought, Willow became hyper aware of all the
things around her.  Namely, the person on the other side of the room getting
undressed was at the forefront of that list.  She finished dressing and was
captivated by the slayers back, which was facing her right now.  The muscles
that moved under that skin mesmerized her.    She broke out of her revere
when Buffy, now fully clothed, turned to face her.  She looked at the bed,
hoping she wasn’t caught, turning bright red.</p>

<p>“You okay Will?”  Buffy wondered why Willow looked like she had just gotten
caught with her hand in the cookie jar.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’m fine.  I’m just sleepy.”  Willow started moving towards the bed,
still looking away.</p>

<p>“Hmm, okay.  Well, we should get to bed then.”  Buffy decided to let it go
and just get some sleep.</p>

<p>They both got under the covers, lying on their backs.  After of few minutes
of silence, Buffy turned onto her side and tentatively slid her arm across
Willow’s waist, hugging the red head to her.</p>

<p>Willow turned to kiss Buffy on the forehead and whispered a goodnight to
her.</p>

<p>“Night.” Came the whispered reply as sleep began to claim both girls.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>When Willow awoke, she noticed a warm mass nestled right against her… and
almost on top of her in some places.  She looked down to see what the mass
was and remember the night before.</p>

<p>Willow decided that she would have to wake the blonde up, no matter how cute
it was seeing her like this.  She lightly caressed Buffy’s cheek with the
tips of two fingers while thinking about how lucky she was.  <Is this a
dream?  If so, please don’t end.></p>

<p>She reached her hand down from the head that was resting on her shoulder to
Buffy’s arm.  She lightly shook the arm.</p>

<p>“Hey.” She whispered down to the mass of blonde hair.</p>

<p>“Hmuffgh.”  The mass moved further into Willow, causing her heart to clench.
  <She has no idea how endearing she is.></p>

<p>Smiling at Buffy’s behavior, Willow said, “Hmm?  Was that English?”</p>

<p>“Huh?” Answered the mass from her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Let’s try this again.  Good morning.”  Willow moved her hand from Buffy’s
shoulder to the mass of blonde hair and began to run her fingers through it.</p>

<p>“Mmmm.  Morning.”   The mass said, as it stretched its arms, then returned
them to their original position.</p>

<p>“Come on sleepy.  We have to get up, the day awaits.”  Smiling, Willow
really didn’t want to go anywhere either.</p>

<p>“Aw.  I just wanna stay here.”  The mass muffled into her shoulder,
snuggling further.</p>

<p>Willow, knowing there was no other way, began tickling the mass.
Ruthlessly.</p>

<p>“I-I…  Okay!  I’m up.  Please, no more.”  The wheezing reply cam from the
mass, which had sat up on the bed facing Willow who was also sitting up.</p>

<p>“Alright.  I’m done, now scoot.  We have to get ready.”  Willow had her
fingers poised, really for action.  Knowing this, Buffy jumped off the bed,
grabbed her bag and walked out of the room.  Then she stuck her head back in
to stick her tongue out at Willow, then ducked back out the room.</p>

<p>Smiling at Buffy’s antics, Willow got out of bed and began to get her own
stuff together for her shower.</p>
