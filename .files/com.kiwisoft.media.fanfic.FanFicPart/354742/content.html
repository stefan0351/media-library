<!-- Blood \ Chapter 6 -->

<P>Janeway raise one elegant eyebrow over her coffee cup. While Seven had politely declined liquid refreshment she and the Captain were familiar enough that Janeway was comfortable getting herself another cup of coffee. Now drinking said cup she sipped and paused, letting her brow communicate for her. "B'Elanna Torres fled from your presence?" While her head was hung morosely she looked up with an expression that Janeway knew was anger. "I fail to see what you find so amusing with Lieutenant Torres find my presence intolerable." Janeway grinned openly at that. "On the contrary Seven, I think she found your presence entirely TOO tolerable." Confusion gained prominence on the young woman's features. "Elaborate."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled and patted the couch next to her in a motion for Seven to sit down next to her, and surprisingly she did. "Just think, was it anything like another encounter you had in the mess hall?" Both Seven's human brow and occular implant arched nearly up to her hairline as she looked at Janeway with disbelief. "You are incorrect, Lieutenant Torres does not with to copulate with me." Janeway's smile slipped into a grin. "Take your data from the encounter with Lieutenant Torres and compare it to the encounter with Ensign Kim, correlate the information with the memories of the Son of Kvok." Seven seemed to force her normally impassive expression back into place.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres seemed less then receptive to the advances made by the Son of Kvok." "Did she? Think Seven, what would have happened if security had never interrupted the two of you? The imperious expression seemed to rest easier as she replied. "Lieutenant Torres is the one who called security." Janeway nodded. "Yes, but that was before she knew what you were doing. If I remember right you mentioned that she seemed almost playful when you and the Doctor worked with her in engineering afterwards. Let me ask you this. can you provide any other hypothesis for her behavior?" Minute after minute clicked by and with each minutes Seven's expression seemed to get more confused while Janeway's grew more triumphant.</P>
<P>"You can't, can you?" Seven looked up at her; the wide eyed confusion a silent request for clarity. The expression immediately reached Janeway and her features softened. "All the reasoning in the universe can't quantify love, and despite our recent mental exercise it can not detect it either. It is purely a function of the enigma that is sentience. If you are feeling these feelings then you are ready for them, because there is no other option." Seven's posture was already academy perfect, but her shoulders still slid back as she straightened. "I also confided my feelings to the Doctor and he said I could also attempt to ignore my feelings." The captain's expression darkened. "The Doctor can not even ignore his feelings and it is wrong from him to think you should."</P>
<P>Seven seemed confused, but Janeway continued before she could question the Captain further. "Seven, you know what you feel, you always have and have always felt free to express it." Janeway allowed herself a slight chuckle at that. "Why can't you now?" "I fear B'Elanna's reaction." Janeway laid a hand on the young woman's knee. "You didn't fear mine when you chastised me for risking B'Elanna's life on the Mari home world. The fact is B'Elanna's reaction is irrelevant because you will continue to feel the way you do until you resolve the emotion. No matter what her response is you will be free of the limbo you are in now." "What do I do?" Janeway smiled and scooted closer on the couch.</P>
