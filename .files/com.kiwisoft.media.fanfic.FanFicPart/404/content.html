<p>It wasn't supposed to be like this.</p>
		<p>"Aphrodite!"</p>
		<p>The Goddess turned around and watched as the famous Warrior entered the room, Gabrielle right by her side.</p>
		<p>"What the hell is that?!" Xena asked angrily, pointing to the large window in front of them. They watched in silence as the distraught brunette held the dying blonde in her arms.</p>
		<p>"She's not going to survive is she?" Gabrielle asked quietly, her voice cracking with pain. Aphrodite shook her head, unable to speak.</p>
		<p>"This isn't right! Do something! You're a goddess! Do something!" Xena begged, grabbing Aphrodite by the arms.</p>
		<p>"I'm the goddess of love Xena, not a miracle worker!" Aphrodite finally snapped, breaking free from the warrior's grasp. She walked away, trying to compose herself. She turned her attention back to the window, watching as the paramedics pronounced the young girl dead at the scene.</p>
		<p>"By the gods", Aphrodite groaned, her knees almost buckling as she experienced for herself the sheer agony that was consuming Samantha McPherson. She watched on helplessly as the brunette sank to her knees, overcome with grief.</p>
		<p>"I can't take it anymore", Aphrodite whispered, flicking her hand as she turned away, the window now displaying a stunning view from the top of Mount Olympus.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle began to cry, burying her face in Xena's neck as the warrior wrapped her long arms around her. Placing her cheek against the blonde head, Xena looked sorrowfully at Aphrodite, unsuccessfully trying to hold back the tears.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry...I.."</p>
		<p>"No need to apologize Xena, I understand", Aphrodite interrupted sadly, allowing her own tears to run unchecked.</p>
		<p>She walked slowly to her self proclaimed "Window of Love" and gazed out at the beautiful surroundings of Mount Olympus. It was times like these that she hated being the Goddess of Love.</p>
		<p>Glancing at the two entwined lovers several feet away, Aphrodite smirked. More often than not she was successful, the legendary relationship between Xena and Gabrielle an example of her finest work.</p>
		<p>And then there were times when true love was never meant to be and the pain often became too much to bare. Like now.</p>
		<p>There were millions of couples around the world that Aphrodite kept an eye on. She never made people "fall in love", the emotions always came from the mortals themselves. Her job was to encourage them to share their feelings and even create situations where they can do just that.</p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle were destined to meet in every lifetime, but it was no accident that thousands of years ago, Xena, on the spur of the moment, decided to pass through Gabrielle's hometown of Potadeaia, rather than taking the more logical short cut to her own village of Amphipolis.</p>
		<p>And so began one of the great love stories.</p>
		<p>When Aphrodite first became aware of Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen, the Goddess had squealed in delight, both teenagers quickly finding their way amongst her favourites, Aphrodite spending many an hour viewing their volatile, but utterly charming, relationship through the "WIndow of Love".</p>
		<p>A popular cheerleader falling in love with a fellow student who barely stood above the janitor in the social hierarchy. Not only that, the said student happened to be her step sister.</p>
		<p>Aphrodite grinned.</p>
		<p>It was a classic.</p>
		<p>"Isn't there anything we can do?", Gabrielle finally asked, still struggling to compose herself. "Brooke is too young too die. And Sam, hasn't she suffered enough?"</p>
		<p>Aphrodite turned around and gazed fondly at blonde. If Xena wasn't her eternal soulmate, the Goddess would have jumped at the chance to take her place.</p>
		<p>She observed the grief stricken expressions on both their faces. They had suffered so much through their many lifetimes together, spending each and every one of them fighting for the greater good.</p>
		<p>The Powers That Be, in gratitude, had offered them peace and the chance to spend some time in the Elysian Fields before reincarnating to a new life, the Warrior and the Bard using the opportunity to watch over their many descendants.</p>
		<p>Sam and Brooke amongst them.</p>
		<p>"I won't have it Aphrodite", Xena said with conviction. She stepped away from Gabrielle and began pacing.</p>
		<p>"Not again. We just dealt with Willow losing Tara and now this? No. They're too damn young! This will kill her!" She cried out, referring to Sam. The Warrior knew only too well what the brunette was feeling. Xena had watched Gabrielle die many times before her and the pain never eased until they were re-united again.</p>
		<p>"What do you want me to do?" Aphrodite asked in confusion. "I'm not supposed to interfere with mortal lives directly".</p>
		<p>"That's never stopped you before", Gabrielle replied, half seriously.</p>
		<p>"If you weren't my favourite...", Aphrodite threatened, glaring at the blonde.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle smiled, kissing Aphrodite on the cheek.</p>
		<p>The goddess thought for a few moments then sighed. She was so whipped.</p>
		<p>"Fine. This is the last time, okay?"</p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle nodded, grinning.</p>
		<p>"Why don't I believe that?" Aphrodite asked rhetorically.</p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle stared back innocently, then hugged her both at once.</p>
		<p>"Thanks Aphrodite", Xena said, gratefully. "I owe you one".</p>
		<p>"Not true, Warrior Babe. You've saved my pretty ass too many times over the years. Besides, " Aphrodite replied, "I want this almost as much as you do. Brooke and Sam are destined for great things".</p>
		<p>"Like what?" Gabrielle asked.</p>
		<p>"Like Brooke McQueen becoming the first female President of the United States", Aphrodite answered with a shrug. Personally, she couldn't understand why anyone would want to enter a life of politics. How boring! And the stress! If one wanted their face to resemble a road map, then Politics was definitely the way to go.</p>
		<p>Aphrodite shuddered.</p>
		<p>Xena grinned with pride. "That's my girl".</p>
		<p>"And Sam?" Gabrielle inquired.</p>
		<p>"Right beside her as her First lady", Aphrodite smiled. "Together, their courage will change the world", the goddess continued, quoting the famous opening credits to a certain television show.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle growled. "Don't get me started! I swear, on the head of Ares, if we ever come across Mr Robert Tapert, I'll kick his ass to Tartarus. Did you see that finale?!"</p>
		<p>Xena rolled her eyes, as Gabrielle began to rant. Again. The Warrior knew she would be hearing this for eternity.</p>
		<p>"I know, sweetie", she replied absently, patting Gabrielle on the head.</p>
		<p>"Xena, don't patronize me!" Gabrielle replied, glaring at her partner. "He chopped off your head! That never happened! What was he thinking, writing that sh..."</p>
		<p>"Ahem! More important matters at hand, blondie", Aphodite interrupted.</p>
		<p>"Sorry", Gabrielle replied sheepishly.</p>
		<p>The goddess regarded them seriously. </p>
		<p>"I will give the girls one last chance to change their fates. I will not directly interfere. I'm warning you now that the end result might still be the same".</p>
		<p>She paused.</p>
		<p>"It's up to them now".</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Sam slowly opened her eyes and sat up. She glanced at her bedside clock with a look of surprise. It was five in the evening and for the life of her, Sam couldn't remember going up to her room for a nap.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Must've been tired or something.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Yawning, she rubbed her eyes then quickly pulled her hands away. She looked at them curiously. They were wet. Running into the bathroom, she looked into the mirror to find her face streaked with tears, and her eyes puffy and red.</p>
		<p>She pulled back surprised.</p>
		<p>
			<i>I've been crying. A nightmare? I don't remember dreaming anything.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Washing her face and making herself presentable, Sam acknowledged the heavy feeling in her chest. She wondered if she had caught some virus and debated whether to take a panadol or two before the dance tonight. Before she could decide, Brooke entered the bathroom, stopping short when she realised that it was already occupied.</p>
		<p>"Sorry, I thought you were still sleeping", Brooke said with an apologetic smile.</p>
		<p>Sam just stared at her.</p>
		<p>"Sam? You okay?" the blonde cheerleader asked curiously, when Sam made no effort to respond. She recieved the shock of her life when the brunette leapt forward, throwing her arms around her neck.</p>
		<p>"It's so good to see you!" Sam cried out happily.</p>
		<p>Brooke stood frozen, slowly lifting her arms to embrace Sam.</p>
		<p>"Not that I don't appreciate this rare show of emotion, but may I ask why?" Brooke asked after several moments, enjoying the feel of Sam pressed up against her.</p>
		<p>Sam stepped back, embarrassed. "I have no idea".</p>
		<p>Brooke smiled, still a little confused. "It's as good a reason as any I guess".</p>
		<p>Sam didn't reply, trying to contemplate the weird events of the past few minutes. The sense of relief at seeing Brooke was so strong, the sheer force of it nearly drove Sam to her knees. She had no idea where these emotions were coming from or what was causing them, but she was sure of one thing. </p>
		<p>She wanted to hold Brooke and never let go.</p>
		<p>"Since we're getting all emotional and everything", Brooke joked, "I just wanted to let you know that if Harrison chooses you tonight, they'll be no hard feelings on my part".</p>
		<p>
			<i>Harrison, who?</i>
		</p>

		<p>Sam stared blankly for a moment. "Oh, yeah. That."</p>
		<p>Brooke shifted uncomfortably as the silence between them grew more tense. She wondered for the millionth time why she was trying so hard to fight for the affections of a guy she didn't really care about.</p>
		<p>Brooke knew that the answer was standing right in front of her. Any situation which required Brooke to interact with the brunette for as long as possible was a good enough reason for her.</p>
		<p>"May the best girl win, huh?" Brooke joked, her smile resembling more of a grimace.</p>
		<p>"Yeah", was Sam's bland response.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Xena, Gabrielle and Aphrodite sat forward, their eyes intently focused on the images in front of them. It had been several hours since Brooke and Sam's conversation in the bathroom and neither girl had admitted their true feelings. They watched as Harrison danced with Sam, Brooke glaring at them from across the room, jealously clear on her beautiful face.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle glanced at Xena, extremely worried. "There isn't much time".</p>
		<p>Aphrodite stood up and began pacing, throwing her arms up in the air in disgust. </p>
		<p>"What is wrong with you mortals?! If you love someone why don't you just say it!" She cried out frustrated. She glared at the other two occupants in the room and continued her rant. </p>
		<p>"Why are they so stubborn?! Exactly like you two were! Then again, why am I surprised, they're your friggin descendants!" Aphrodite picked up the closest statue and threw it against the wall. "Damn it!"</p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle didn't know what to say, shocked at what they had just seen. They had never seen Aphrodite lose her temper so completely before.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry", she apologised. She sighed. "I get like this sometimes and I wonder why I bother. Love is wasted on you mortals."</p>
		<p>Xena stood up and placed a comforting arm around the goddess. "We have faith in you Aphrodite, don't give up".</p>
		<p>She grinned with arrogance.</p>
		<p>"Besides, they've got our genes, they'll pull through".</p>
		<p>Aphrodite couldn't help but smile.</p>
		<p>They always did.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Harrison guided both girls to a more quiet area of the room. He stopped and regarded them silently for a moment. They looked so nervous and distressed. He smiled inwardly.</p>
		<p>
			<i>I better put them out of their misery.</i>
		</p>
		<p>He couldn't believe that the two most beautiful girls in the school were fighting over him. It was only natural that he would be loving every single second of it.</p>
		<p>He began to speak.</p>
		<p>"Before I tell you who I've chosen, I just want to let both of you know that this was the hardest decision I've ever had to make".</p>
		<p>He paused, facing Brooke.</p>
		<p> "I've loved you for as long as I can remember and I never thought that given the choice, I would ever choose anyone over you. But Sam is one of my closest friends and has always been there for me, and over the last several days I've come to the realisation that I love her. I'm really sorry".</p>
		<p>He faced Sam, grabbing her by the shoulders.</p>
		<p>"I choose you Sam. I love you".</p>
		<p>Sam stood there in shock, not quite believing what she was hearing. She hadn't considered the consequences of Harrison choosing her over Brooke because she did not believe for a single second that it would actually happen.</p>
		<p>Despite that, she smiled, genuinely touched by his words, accepting his hug.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"No! No! No!", Aphrodite watched on in horror. "It's happening again".</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Oh god."</p>
		<p>Brooke stepped back, unable to fight the tears. She didn't care that Harrison had chosen Sam over her, what she hadn't realised was how much it would hurt to see Sam return his feelings.</p>
		<p>
			<i>She loves him.</i>
		</p>
		<p>She couldn't handle it. She had to leave.</p>
		<p> Without a backward glance, Brooke turned and ran.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Sam pulled away from Harrison's embrace, watching as Brooke fled.</p>
		<p>"Brooke! Wait!" she called out, starting after her.</p>
		<p>"Let her go. She needs time to get over this", Harrison said, wrapping his arms around her waist. She stopped, considering his words. Maybe Harrison was right. Maybe Brooke did need some time alone.</p>
		<p>
			<i>I had no idea she really cared for him.</i>
		</p>

		<p>Returning to Harrison's side, Sam suddenly grabbed her head and groaned, her mind assaulted by quick images.</p>
		<p>Images of Brooke crying.</p>
		<p>Brooke's broken body flying through the air.</p>
		<p>Sam holding Brooke as she lay dying.</p>
		<p>Sam collapsing in grief.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh my god.</i>
		</p>

		<p>"Brooke! BROOKE!" Sam began to scream, becoming hysterical.</p>
		<p>She ran.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Exiting the toilets, Brooke turned around when she heard Sam scream her name.</p>
		<p>She couldn't speak to her in this state, knowing full well she would break down as soon as she looked into Sam's eyes. She turned away and picked up the pace.</p>
		<p>She needed to leave this fucking place.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Brooke! No!"</p>
		<p>Sam was scared. For the first time in her life, she knew real fear. She didn't know where the images came from, or if they were just fragments of her imagination, but she needed to stop Brooke from leaving.</p>
		<p>Shoving people aside, Sam ran for her life.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Brooke! Stop! Please!"</p>
		<p>Brooke ignored Sam's frantic cries. She continued running, almost reaching the parking lot.</p>
		<p>"Brooke! I love you!"</p>
		<p>
			<i>What?</i>
		</p>
		<p>She stopped, mere centimetres away from a speeding car. She stepped back in shock, realising just how close she was to being hit.</p>
		<p>Reaching the blonde, Sam threw herself in Brooke's arms.</p>
		<p>"You're okay", she sobbed, nuzzling Brooke's neck. "You're okay".</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Xena, Gabrielle and Aphrodite watched on, crying tears of happiness.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>They continued to hold each other tightly.</p>
		<p>"Ow! What was that for?!" Brooke cried out suddenly, rubbing her arm.</p>
		<p>"That's what you get for ignoring me!" Sam explained angrily, her voice thick with emotion.</p>
		<p>"Did I hear you correctly? Did you say you loved me?" Brooke asked, stepping closer when she was sure Sam wouldn't hit her again.</p>
		<p>Sam nodded, looking down. </p>
		<p>"I have for a long time now", she admitted in a whisper. "I think I always have".</p>
		<p>Brooke smiled and reached out, gently cupping her cheek, waiting for Sam to look up. "I love you too Sam".</p>
		<p>"You do?" she asked surprised.</p>
		<p>"A thousand lifetimes wouldn't be enough to show you" Brooke replied, kissing her gently.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Harrison watched as Brooke and Sam kissed with increasing passion.</p>
		<p>He should have known it was too good to be true.</p>
		<p>He went back inside, hoping that someone had the decency to spike the punch.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"I feel sorry for the guy", Xena replied, gesturing to Harrison.</p>
		<p>"Me too", Gabrielle agreed.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry, his time will come", Aphrodite reassured them, a champagne bottle appearing in her hand. "Now let's celebrate! To love!"</p>
		<p>"To love", Xena and Gabrielle echoed, smiling at each other.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Sam pulled back slightly, gazing into the blonde's glowing hazel eyes.</p>
		<p>"I liked that. Kissing is good." she announced happily.</p>
		<p>Brooke laughed.</p>
		<p>"We need to do that again."</p>
		<p>So they did.</p>
		<p>Again and again and again...</p>
