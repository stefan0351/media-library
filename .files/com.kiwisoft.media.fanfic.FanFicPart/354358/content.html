<!-- Becoming One \ Part 14: Battling Hell - Part 1 -->

<p>In a spacious, decorated room in the Council's main building, all watchers and slayers in training from around the world gathered in anticipation. They were all called to the grounds to apparently hear an announcement. Which was strange to everyone assembled, because most things would be sent out in a memorandum.</p>
<p>They all sat in uncomfortable wooden chairs around the room, and a podium was facing them, awaiting a speaker. Before the tension could rise anymore, a sharply dressed woman entered and stood behind the podium. She seemed nervous.</p>
<p>&#34;Thank you all for coming. For some of you, I realize it was quite a long trip to take, so I shall get right to the point. Due to recent developments with our rogue, active slayer, the occurrences around this complex, and Mr. Travers,&#34; she cleared her throat, &#34;disappearance, we are forced to make some tough decisions.</p>
<p>&#34;So now I will allow our founder to address you.&#34;</p>
<p>There were shocked gasps all around. Nobody in the room had met the founder. They'd heard of him, of course. Tales, rumors, but only those higher up had been in his presence. This must have been serious.</p>
<p>The lights shut off. It didn't look like they'd get to see him. Like good employees, they just sat still, and waited patiently. And blocked all other thoughts out of their heads. Such as, why does he need the lights off? A few seconds later, his voice was heard.</p>
<p>&#34;As was already mentioned, recent developments have forced me to make a decision. You have all done more than admirable jobs here. Especially during this time of crisis. But things are changing.</p>
<p>&#34;It has become more and more obvious that this institution is losing its influence. And the only person who is at fault is not in this room. She is across the ocean, turning her back to us. She will suf.&#34; He trailed off. &#34;But I digress.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;As of right of now, the Council is no more. You are all to return to your respective contents, countries, and homes. Thank you for your service.&#34; The expected commotion did not come, and the founder, if he had lips, would have smiled at his success. &#34;On second thought, seeing how your world will be reclaimed tonight, it would be rude of me to make you travel again.&#34;</p>
<p>Now there was commotion. People shuffled around, trying to understand what was going on, but also trying to leave. The air had suddenly become very.unclean. And then, red eyes appeared in the darkness. After a moment, the lights switched back on, and the room was completely empty.</p>
<p>&#34;Tonight, I rejoin my brethren at the Mouth of Hell.&#34; The voice said.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>On the roof of Giles' house, two people were fighting. The intensity was high, the focus clear. They were giving it their all. A streak of blond rushed a steak of red. Arms clashed. Legs were swung. And blocked.</p>
<p>A Slayer flipped over a Wicca, and the redhead tried to sweep her leg for the trip. It missed; the blonde grabbed her opponent's arm, and flipped her over on her back. The redhead countered with a flip of her own, and then jumped up, using both feet to kick the other fighter in the chest.</p>
<p>&#34;That's enough for now.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>But they didn't hear him. Buffy grinned, jumped up and kicked. Willow stuck her palm out calmly, and stopped her in midair. Willow smiled, and let her partner go. The Slayer knew she was going to fall, so she used all her momentum to tackle Willow to the ground on her way down.</p>
<p>Buffy leaned over her, out of breath. &#34;Draw?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We're all about equality.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Damn right.&#34;</p>
<p>She helped Willow up, and they shared a quick kiss.</p>
<p>&#34;I've never known sparring partners to do that after a session.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Well we're not just sparring partners.&#34; Willow said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#34;No I suppose not. You're both ready.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Glad you think so, Giles.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>Then, Xander, Oz and Cordelia, came up to the roof, large maps in hand.</p>
<p>&#34;How'd it go?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Well, they're all sweaty, so.&#34; Xander started, but stopped when he saw the glare.</p>
<p>&#34;Went fine. How about you?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Think we figured out the best way to go in.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;Even though all the sewers look exactly the same.&#34; Cordelia added.</p>
<p>&#34;Are we sure we want to do this?&#34; Willow asked. &#34;I mean.you read the note.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's a risk we have to take. Wesley would have wanted us to attempt this.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Think of it this way, Will. If you think we have a problem now, if Angelus does this ritual thing.well I don't really want to think details.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>&#34;They're right. But we're not losing anybody. Anybody.&#34; Buffy said clearly.</p>
<p>They were all silent for a few seconds, thinking about what was coming tonight. What they'd have to do.</p>
<p>&#34;Maps?&#34; Oz asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Maps.&#34; Giles agreed.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Aneas cerilis, I give.&#34; Angelus said, practicing the ritual in the dimly, candle-lit lair.</p>
<p>He had tied Wesley up in the corner. The Englishman had been quiet, which was good, because any distractions.would have made him very unpleasant. It was bad enough he was in a cramped space with Hell's rejects lurking about, but a panicky ex-watcher on top of that, would have been too much.</p>
<p>&#34;Is that the ritual?&#34;</p>
<p>He was his own jinx. &#34;You're quick. And before you ask, you wouldn't have found the step by step instructions. A thousand watchers working their asses off wouldn't have been able to find it. Sketchy overview probably, but beyond that.so don't feel bad.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And why not?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Because it was never published. It's not in any prophecy books, spell books, nothing. This was given to me directly.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;By whom?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Did I mention I hated people who asked too many questions?&#34; As he said that, the cloaked figure appeared in the room. &#34;Why don't you ask him yourself?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ah so this is the one It wants.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It?&#34; Wesley asked.</p>
<p>&#34;He doesn't seem very threatening.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He's got knowledge. That makes him threatening enough.&#34; Angelus said.</p>
<p>&#34;Knowledge is a dangerous weapon. I remember now. You're the one who returned the Slayer to full health.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I merely provided -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He defends himself as if I care. How I miss the mortal world.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, sir, if you'd let me run the show, maybe I could get you here tonight.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm sorry, am I interrupting?&#34; Before Angelus realized the error of his words, he felt himself being pulled. Strongly. &#34;I may want to walk the Earth and the higher lords may want freedom, but if your tone doesn't get more respectful, I will return you here. And they will not question my actions. Understood?&#34;</p>
<p>The vampire nodded, and the force pulling him, stopped.</p>
<p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Wesley finally asked. The figure pulled the cloak down, and the Master's face looked at Wesley. &#34;It's really true.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I sense fear. Fear! It's been so long. It'll be quite a battle. And a victory. Too bad you won't be around to see it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Your executioner is on the way at this very moment. You should feel honored. It has been around since the beginning. I'll leave you, Angelus.&#34;</p>
<p>The Master vanished, and Angelus turned sharply to look at Wesley. &#34;Not a word.&#34;</p>
<p>But he wasn't going to say anything. He was going to die. Talking would have been pointless.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Giles, we're taking all your weapons.&#34; Buffy said. &#34;Every last one.&#34;</p>
<p>He nodded and went to gather them up.</p>
<p>&#34;Should we get a stockpile from our friendly neighbor military base?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
<p>&#34;One of these days you're gonna get caught you know.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;No, there isn't time. Buffy and I are the ones who are supposed to really do this anyway. You guys shouldn't be putting yourself in the battle. If it opens, it won't just be vampires.&#34; Willow said, slipping into the co-leader role nicely.</p>
<p>&#34;I have to back her up on that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Of course you do.&#34; Xander said, sighing at the blonde.</p>
<p>&#34;At the risk of losing part of my masculinity, helping from a safe distance sits well with me.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>Giles continued to empty out his trunk, as he listened to the planning stage. He was scared, and he'd admit that freely if asked. But once again, he had to admire the willingness of this close knit group. Friendship had to truly be the force that could conquer all. Love was powerful too, but put together, it was unbeatable combination.</p>
<p>After this was over, he briefly wondered if he should tell Buffy and Willow what was in store for them. In talking with the Goddess and doing a little reading, he had found out that the Great Slayer and Sorceress' bond had one more.surprise attached to it. But he shook that thought away. There were other things to worry about first.</p>
<p>&#34;So what's the plan, Superchicks?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Will, Giles and I are going to going sewer hunting. I don't know how long it'll take to reach the Master's cave.anything could be.which is why we're leaving we're leaving in forty-five minutes. That should give us lots of time to get there.</p>
<p>&#34;Hopefully Will can whip up something so Angelus doesn't know we're own our way. If we do make it in time, she and I will really, really hurt Angelus, dust him, burn the ashes.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And while your doing that?&#34; Cordelia asked hoping to break her friend's tangent. Even though she did want Angelus dead too.</p>
<p>&#34;Giles will get Wesley in the clear. If we don't -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then you guys will be waiting across the street from where the school used to be.&#34; Willow continued.</p>
<p>&#34;Before you blew it up. Right?&#34; Cordelia added, grinning.</p>
<p>&#34;Can we skip that? So you'll be there with supplies cause that's where the baddies are gonna be, and we'll meet you there.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We give you the goods then split.&#34; Oz stated.</p>
<p>&#34;Right. Giles, where do you think the safest hiding spot will be?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;The Bronze is closed tonight.&#34; He offered.</p>
<p>&#34;Perfect. Then, can you round up people on the streets and take them there?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Wait. How'd you know the Bronze was closed tonight?&#34; Buffy wondered aloud.</p>
<p>Giles ignored the question, which was probably the best choice for all concerned. &#34;Of course I'll go with them, but.are you sure you want to handle this alone?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think I finally figured out what got Buffy so worried every time she slayed with us. If you guys in the middle of it with us, I would screw up because of worry.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And this isn't an every day life or death situation.&#34; Buffy went on. &#34;This is it. The Big One. Getting rid of the demonic hole in the ground. And distractions would be bad. I'm not saying -&#34; Buffy cut herself off.</p>
<p>&#34;No offense taken.&#34; Giles assured her.</p>
<p>&#34;Ditto. Their three friends echoed.</p>
<p>&#34;And besides, this is our -&#34; Willow began.</p>
<p>&#34;Destiny.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy, Willow and the rest of the gang walked to the rubble that was Sunnydale High. It was a pitiful sight really. The school that had held them captive for three years was barely able to hold dust. However, reminiscing on old times was not the point of the excursion.</p>
<p>&#34;Stay hidden across the street.&#34; Buffy told Oz, Xander and Cordelia. &#34;We'll drop into the sewers about four blocks down. Even though that still doesn't make much sense.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Because Buffy,&#34; Willow sighed, feeling as though this was the fiftieth time she was explaining it, &#34;if we go down this close, Angelus will have the advantage.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How?&#34; Giles asked, genuinely curious.</p>
<p>&#34;All the energy right here is strong. But it's not the good kind. And it's not just Hellmouthy energy. He's protected by something. The further away we are the better chance the 'he won't be able to tell we're coming' spell will work. And we might still have the surprise element on our side.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Guess we should go. Be careful, guys.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;You too.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;Come back, okay?&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;We will.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>Xander hugged the both of them, and then they were off.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They reached the manhole, and were proceeding to lift it off. Well, actually Buffy and Giles were. Willow was in the process of reciting a spell.</p>
<p>&#34;All done. Protection/vamp radar-canceling spell.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow I realize that you can do almost any spell with relative ease, but if we come to the point where you have to destroy the Hellmouth, I'd advise you to not expend much energy.&#34; Giles cautioned.</p>
<p>&#34;I'll be okay. I won't mess up.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I didn't mean to imply -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know you didn't.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ready?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>With that, she jumped down. Giles helped Willow to lower herself, and then climbed down. Their legs immediately became submerged. Only it didn't feel like water. Buffy flipped on her miniature flashlight, and directed the beam.</p>
<p>Giles was the first to comment. &#34;Good Lord.&#34;</p>
<p>They were standing in blood. A sewer wide river of it. The walls of the tunnel also looked slick and not your typical sewer structure. Buffy lighted one of the walls, and saw slithering things moving around.</p>
<p>Then she saw the form moving in the blood river. It was almost like, like Hell had started to reshape everything. Including starting to populate the world with it's inhabitants. She was starting to rethink being down here, but she knew she didn't have a choice.</p>
<p>Then the form started to come closer.</p>
<p>&#34;Will? Remember when you said Angelus had something protecting him?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Uh huh.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well I think it's more like a lot of somethings.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Uh huh.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Did either of you notice that one of those somethings is heading this way?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Uh huh.&#34; Willow repeated again.</p>
<p>&#34;Any ideas?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Waiting to see if the world would end was a very nerve-racking experience. The three slayerettes were happy to follow the safe orders, though. If they happened to see people walking by, they told them it was probably a good idea if they stayed inside. And the good thing was that most of the residents recognized them, and knew there was probably trouble coming.</p>
<p>So, like good &#34;wanting to remain ignorant of the obvious&#34; people, they went back to their homes. And Cordelia, Xander, and Oz were left trying figure out something to talk about.</p>
<p>&#34;This is.fun. Aren't you guys having fun?&#34; Xander tried.</p>
<p>&#34;There's been no death, that's a check in the positive column, but fun is stretching it.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>Cordelia wasn't really paying much attention to the two males. She was too busy thinking.</p>
<p>'Just ask him. Quick and fast like a Band-Aid.'</p>
<p>When she finally focused, and was ready, she realized Xander was standing in front of her.</p>
<p>&#34;I've thought about it, and if we get through this.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It'll be just you, me, and the Big Apple Core.&#34;</p>
<p>Her face was glowing. &#34;Are you serious?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Serious about starting a life? Yeah. And I wanna do it with you.&#34;</p>
<p>She crushed him in a hug. &#34;I love you.&#34;</p>
<p>His eyes went wide. &#34;You.we.you do?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Just cause I don't say it every five seconds.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I.love you too. It's just that we haven't really said that to each other before.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We were just scared to commit. I've never committed to anyone before.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I've never been in a position to commit to anyone before. Feels good.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It does, doesn't it?&#34;</p>
<p>They smiled at one another, and turned to face Oz.</p>
<p>&#34;Congrats.&#34; He said.</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;We have to get you set up, Oz.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>&#34;Nah. I'm in no rush.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You know, you gave Willow up pretty easily.&#34; Cordelia realized.</p>
<p>&#34;Can't fight fate. Besides, she did show me that there are still nice girls in the world. I'll get my shot. Right now she's happy. That's all that matters.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah. Think they're enjoying what they're doing right now, though?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
<p>&#34;How can they not? They save the world. That's what they do.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They all tried to get up against a wall to get some sort of leverage on the thing that was submerged and moving towards them.</p>
<p>&#34;It's times like these that I wonder why the world just can't save itself.&#34; Buffy complained.</p>
<p>&#34;Where is it?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Start moving, but stick to wall. Maybe we can avoid it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You know what this reminds me of?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Ghostbusters II?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah. When they went in the sewer and there was all that negative slime flowing underneath the city.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How is this helping?&#34; He wondered.</p>
<p>&#34;It helps us not panic.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Reminds me of something too. Remember in StarWars when they were in the giant trash compactor, and that thing pulled Luke underwater?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's about to happen to me.&#34; Buffy said trying to pull her leg.</p>
<p>Willow tried to reach for her, but Buffy was pulled under the blood, and dragged across to the other side.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy!&#34; She took a deep breath. &#34;You have a blade, right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;When you see the thing, use it.&#34;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, and the blood slowly separated. Beneath it, a demon that kind of looked like a large fish with tentacles, and an even larger set of jaws, held Buffy in its grip. It was pulling her toward its mouth.</p>
<p>Giles, seeing the strain it was putting on Willow, wasted no time. He jammed the blade through the demon's back, and it howled, freeing Buffy. He helped her up, and Willow stopped, the blood filling the tunnel once again.</p>
<p>&#34;Is it dead?&#34; She asked.</p>
<p>Buffy, covered in blood, reached her arm underneath, and pulled the creature to the surface. She grabbed one of its tentacles, and crushed its throat. &#34;It is now. You okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;This place is filled with an evil vibe, and it's kind of draining. But I'll be okay.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How's she supposed to close the Hellmouth if one minor-type spell makes her tired?&#34; Buffy asked Giles.</p>
<p>&#34;She will.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But how will I know what to do?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;You just will. You'll have to trust yourself.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't like this. We should.let's get moving.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>They started to walk again.</p>
<p>&#34;Your clothes are -&#34; Willow started.</p>
<p>&#34;I know. The demons will pay. Oh, they'll pay.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Do you feel that, Wesley?&#34; Angelus asked, having situated and prepared everything necessary for the ritual. All that was left was waiting for the right alignment, which was in a little less than two hours. &#34;That chill?&#34;</p>
<p>He did feel it. And he didn't like it. &#34;What's your point, demon?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Demon? That's kinda rude. I thought all Englishmen were courteous. At least they used to be. Before I fed.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I only speak the truth.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I guess you are. Do you want to know that chill was? It means it's close.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What's close?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Now you're demanding. I don't like this at all. But, seeing as how you're going to die instantly when it arrives, I'll explain. How's your history?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Which country?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm talking before countries. Before people. Before good. Before demons.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There was nothing then. Joined land masses, myths, legends.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Heard the myth of the First Evil? Hell's first creation in this dimension?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Before sin, before hate, before anger, -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, and the list continues. Well, here's a surprise. It's not a myth. When the leaders in Hell heard about this place, they conjured up the most destructive force imaginable. And let it loose. But it got bored.</p>
<p>&#34;So, the always fashionably late good guys finally decided to try and play catch up, so Earth wouldn't experience the same fate as all the others. They created people, animals, plants to try and counteract the evil.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Everyone was slaughtered.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You catch on fast. It grew. It got stronger with every life it took. Along with its masters they punched a hole into the Earth. A gateway. So demonic creations, flesh and blood creatures could come through.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The Hellmouth.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Right again.&#34; Angelus crouched in front of Wesley. &#34;And that's when the good guys stepped in again. They created one person. A girl who would grow up to be the first Slayer.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She closed the Hellmouth after a long battle. She was pure good, and light. She had a child to which she passed down her slayer abilities. The race continued to grow, although because they were born through reproduction with normal human males, the race lost some of its strength after every generation.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;With all these demons running around, and the creation of vampires; because some demons mixed their blood with their victims, it was only a matter of time before someone was going to get the idea to try and formally train all these slayers.</p>
<p>&#34;The First Evil was a God to the newer, lesser demons, but then its masters told it to find a way to keep a watch on the fighters. To gain control. The first man who stepped forward was a decent man, honest. He had been keeping written records on the demon species', and made a habit of observing slayers and their abilities.</p>
<p>&#34;The man wanted to start a place where slayers would come to train, to learn. He did. For purely good intentions. And then the influence of the First Evil got to him, drove him to the brink of insanity. But by then, the institution was already built, and the First Evil had gained control. And then it went into hiding. No one knew what to do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He handpicked successors, didn't he? Figureheads. While he retained total control through his influence and through fear.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Watchers were trained, a council formed, and soon it became the unwritten law that all slayers had to work through the Council.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But why stay inactive for so long? From what you've said, this being likes to kill.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He was a creation of higher beings. Their orders were to remain dormant until the proper time came when the Hellmouth would be reopened. He had to follow them. And the only way it would succeed is if they had control of the fighters on Good's side. Ying and Yang. Everything goes in a cycle. It's Evil's time again.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And together Buffy and Willow have somehow attained the level of skill and purity the original Slayer had. Through love.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Doesn't matter. It shouldn't to you, anyway. Cause guess what? The First Evil's free now, and he's coming home. End of history lesson.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They were close now. Less than a half-hour before Angelus would need to perform the ritual. They were also close to the lair too. It felt like the air was trying to choke them. That's how they knew.</p>
<p>&#34;Does anyone else.feel cold?&#34; Willow asked, shaking a little.</p>
<p>Buffy and Giles nodded. Their fear was growing rapidly. It started in the pit of their stomachs, and kept growing through their bodies. And this was supposed to be the easy plan.</p>
<p>They turned around when the coldness increased, and caught a glimpse of something that looked like a big, dark cloud. But there were two glowing, red.they looked like eyes, in the center of the mass. They didn't look human.</p>
<p>Before they could get a better look, it passed right through them and continued on its way. Buffy and Willow nearly collapsed, as the entity seemed to weaken them. And leave them with a thought in their heads.</p>
<p>'HOME. AND YOU WILL BE REMOVED FROM IT.'</p>
<p>Giles rushed to their aid, but they struggled to regain their composure, and stood up. &#34;Are you two all right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What was that?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;It seems familiar somehow, but -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Hurry. Let's follow it.&#34; Willow said, trying to walk faster.</p>
<p>She was too distracted to know how Buffy was reacting to what just happened, but she felt violated. And she didn't like it.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;You are his chosen, Vampire?&#34; The First Evil asked, when it came into the cave. Almost like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes. Everything's set. Welcome back.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I can feel the energy. It's our time again.&#34; It &#34;turned around&#34; and faced Wesley, who was in the corner. &#34;Finally I get to see the face of the mortal that aided the deserters. Punishment must be carried out. Have you anything to say in your defense?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What will that accomplish?&#34;</p>
<p>Its eyes settled on Wesley, and then it felt something powerful, strike it. Both it and Angelus turned towards the distraction. Willow stood there, and a light emanated from her palms.</p>
<p>&#34;You. What are you doing here?&#34; Angelus growled, angry.</p>
<p>&#34;Were you not aware that they were near, Vampire? Is this a problem?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;This is one half of your two enemies, you know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Actually, it's both.&#34; Buffy said coming in and standing next to Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm aware of who they are. They are of no concern to me, but they seem to be troubling you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Making friends with fog, Angelus? How nice.&#34; Buffy glanced at Willow, and then rushed the vampire.</p>
<p>Willow continued her magickal assault on what she dubbed 'the Evil Fog'. And then it entered her head.</p>
<p>'Are you truly unaware of what I am, Sorceress? Allow me to show you.'</p>
<p>Images bombarded her. Death, destruction, disease, demons, power, all the things the fog had, or was capable of. And then she learned what it was. The First Evil.</p>
<p>'You are strong. Stronger than I have ever seen. But do you think you can destroy me?'</p>
<p>'Not trying to. Right now, I'm trying to keep you busy. And it's working.'</p>
<p>Buffy was engaged in battle with Angelus, and Giles took the opportunity to run in and try to free Wesley.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh thank God.&#34; Wesley was breathing heavily. &#34;I don't subscribe to any religious theory really, but I'm thinking about considering it. It's so evil.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Let's get you out of here.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy backhanded Angelus in the face, and moved to elbow him, but he grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her back.</p>
<p>&#34;Nice try, lover.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not done yet.&#34; She head-butted him, and he let go. She faced him. &#34;All I have to do is break a few candles, and step on a few herbs, and the Master's screwed.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Try it, and oh, take a look at the redhead.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Willow, and gasped. The First Evil was wearing her down, and she was slowly sinking to her knees. She tried to make a move to go help, but Angelus got her in a chokehold and started to squeeze.</p>
<p>&#34;Sad, isn't it? By the looks of you, you must of went through hell,&#34; he tried not to laugh, &#34;to get here. All for nothing.&#34;</p>
<p>'Willow, it's time to share.'</p>
<p>'Are you sure?'</p>
<p>'Don't think, just do it.'</p>
<p>This time, Buffy did elbow him, directly in the chest. Then she grabbed his arm, and flipped him over. She felt Willow borrowing some of her strength, some of her energy.</p>
<p>&#34;Giles, now would be a good time for you two to go.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Right. See you above then.&#34;</p>
<p>Giles and Wesley ran out of the lair. Willow began to stand up, becoming steady, and matching the First Evil's attack. Thanks to Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;The traitor must be punished.&#34; It said, noticing Wesley's hasty exit. &#34;But I know the objective. He will have to wait. Get up, Vampire. The time is here. I will deal with these two.&#34;</p>
<p>Angelus got off the ground, and stood in front of a mixture of herbs. Doing his best to block out his need to hurt Buffy, he started to chant.</p>
<p>&#34;I don't think so.&#34; Buffy said, as she moved to hit him. But she didn't. She got flung back.</p>
<p>&#34;He is under my protection now, Slayer.&#34; The First Evil said.</p>
<p>&#34;Lords of Hell, your time is now. The time for your reign in this dimension is here. Bring forth your minions, and join me. Netis barice, open the gateway to this world.&#34; He held an herb and cross in his hand, and it started to spoke. &#34;Aneas cerilis, I give you my pain. I use an instrument of hurt to bring you through.</p>
<p>&#34;I also sacrifice,&#34; He grabbed a knife and slit his already damaged palm, &#34;my blood. The blood of Hell. It flows from me freely to bring you across.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow and Buffy tried to stop him, but the First Evil was incredibly strong, and the tremors started. They collapsed, and huddled over one another.</p>
<p>&#34;Your first child is present this night, awaiting your arrival. He has followed your orders, as have I. Sateeis Madan; the barrier is at its weakest. Send your soldier through, so he may lead your army in destroying this world. COME! Good will be ended this night. COME! Take your rightful place! COME!&#34;</p>
<p>What could be considered a full-blown earthquake was happening now. Rock from the cave was breaking and crashing to floor. They all felt the ground shifting. The candles shook and fell. There was a loud rumble, which continued getting louder.</p>
<p>Buffy and Willow looked at each other, and stumbled out of the cave. Their enemies were distracted, so they ran. A couple minutes later, the rumbling stopped.</p>
<p>&#34;It is open!&#34; The First Evil yelled with joy.</p>
<p>Angelus looked around. &#34;Where'd they go?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Up on the surface, Xander, Cordelia and Oz all collapsed on top of one another. The ground was cracked, car horns going off, and fire hydrants were spraying water everywhere. They were surrounded by dust.</p>
<p>When it cleared, they saw that what had remained of the school had vanished completely, and a large hole was emitting bursts of dark, black energy. And standing just outside it, was the Master.</p>
<p>&#34;The world is ours!&#34; He yelled into the night.</p>
