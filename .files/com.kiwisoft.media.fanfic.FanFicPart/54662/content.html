<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Two -->

<p>Robie walked into her apartment with Cassidy in tow. She continued into her living room, turned on the lamp and stopped. Cassidy stood behind her, wrapping her arms slowly around her waist. Robie shivered as she felt Cassidy's lips softly caress the back of her neck. "It's true, what you said." She whispered huskily, and moaned as she felt the wet warmth of Cassidy's tongue on her skin.</p>
		<p>"What did I say?" Cassidy whispered, pulling Robie tighter against her hips, kissing her shoulders lightly, running her tongue softly over the skin.</p>
		<p>Robie gasped, pushing her hips backward to meet hers, her back arching. "Jeffrey <i>does</i> hate you." She reached back to grab Cassidy's hips and pulled them forward. "He's insecure because he knows Andrea's not in love with him, but with you... She just doesn't know it yet."</p>
		<p>She felt Cassidy pause in her exploration. Her arms loosened around her. "You're talking nonsense." She said, and pulled away from her. "Andrea is straight."</p>
		<p>Robie turned to gaze at her, laughing softly. "You are as na&iuml;ve as Andrea then, Cassidy. You're so blind with love for her that you can't even see the magnitude of her love for you. Shit, she can't even see it herself!" She said, laughing again.</p>
		<p>Cassidy wouldn't allow herself to be hopeful; she didn't want to be hurt. "Andrea is straight." She argued stubbornly.</p>
		<p>"Okay." Robie shrugged, she wasn't about to argue. Her body quivered with desire as she studied Cassidy from head to toe. "Come here, baby. I want you to make love to me..." She whispered huskily, opening her arms in invitation.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, grateful for Robie's sudden change of subject. She walked into her arms and pressed her lips against her, her silky tongue dancing into Robie's mouth and making gentle contact. She shuddered as Robie's hands traveled down the length of her lean back and cupped her hard buttocks. She pulled her mouth away from Robie's to gasp for air; her body was trembling with the heat of Robie's hands and lips. She looked into Robie's eyes as she whispered: "I want you! Right here, on the floor, completely naked!"</p>
		<p>Robie felt her legs weaken; she wasn't sure how, but she ended up on her back, Cassidy's hard body on top of her, pressing against her and expertly bringing her close to orgasm before they even got their clothes off.</p>
		<p>Andrea shivered violently as Jeffrey entered her. He was slow with her, gentle. He groaned as he pushed deeper into her, as he felt her warmth completely envelop him. "Oh, Andy, I love you!" He gasped as he began a slow rhythm with his hips. He felt her wrap her legs around his waist, her small arms around his neck.</p>
		<p>Andrea felt the rhythm inside her, but for some reason, she wouldn't, <i>could not</i>, respond to him the way she thought she should. Only a small flicker of pleasure pulsed through her. Not enough to make her orgasm, no man had ever brought her to that. It wasn't that Jeffrey was a bad lover, she'd had her share of them, and Jeffrey didn't fit into that category. He was the gentlest and most thoughtful. Orgasm was a stranger to her; the closest she thought she'd gone was when she dared to touch herself.</p>
		<p>Her distracted mind strayed to Cassidy, her beloved Cassidy. <i>My beautiful best friend, whom I love and who loves me.</i> She closed her eyes when she felt Jeffrey increasing the speed of his rhythm.</p>
		<p>With her eyes closed, her mind produced an image of Cassidy, with her tender smiles, so beautiful and sweet. And then she remembered the way Cassidy held her when they danced, the feel of her silky lips against the skin of her forehead. A flash of heat went through her body, and she arched under Jeffrey. The image she'd conjured had been innocent and sweet; she didn't understand why her body reacted in that manner. But then unwittingly, her mind conjured an image of herself and Cassidy, dancing, holding each other the way they did at the restaurant. Only in this image, Cassidy didn't kiss her forehead; she kissed her lips, sweetly and passionately.</p>
		<p>Another jolt shook her, and before she knew it, she was clenching tightly around Jeffrey, experiencing an orgasm. Her cry startled Jeffrey, who'd never heard her cry out in that manner. He had finished along with her, and remained on top of her, asking if she was okay. "Yes, please get off me, please, Jeffrey!" She begged, out of breath, feeling the confusion burn through her. She'd never done that before, thought of Cassidy while she was in bed with any other man. <i>And look at what just happened</i>, she reproached herself, <i>I came my heart out. Came like I never did before. With just a thought of Cassidy...</i></p>
		<p>"I'm going out of state in a couple of weeks, Andy." Jeffrey said into Andrea's hair. He lay on his back and she lay half of her body in his arms. She played with the hairs on his wide chest, her small fingers twirling the curls around.</p>
		<p>She lifted her head to look at him. "Where?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"Massachusetts." He replied, kissing the top of her head. "Just for a couple of weeks, some business work." Jeffrey was a business partner at a prosperous travel agency. From time to time, he would go away a week or more to travel agents conventions at resorts and lodges. So Andrea didn't find it strange. "There's a new resort that sounds good for business. Agents from all over the country were invited to see it and try it out for a couple of weeks."</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled. "That's great!" She said, kissing him lightly on his chin.</p>
		<p>"I wish you could come with me." He said, tightening his muscled arms around her.</p>
		<p>"I have a job, Jeffy. Plus, it's a business trip." Andrea said, but she really didn't want to go with him. "Now, go to sleep." She ordered softly, patting his chest softly, closing her eyes and burrowing deeper into his embrace.</p>
