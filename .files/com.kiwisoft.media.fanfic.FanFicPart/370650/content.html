<P><B>Disclaimer: I own nothing... </B></p>
<P>"Sebastian you are my boyfriend!", said Monique, pulling Sebastian away from the other whore. When Viola realized what was happening she hide her face, if Monique recognised her, she was dead.</p>
<P>"EX Boyfriend", said Viola through her hands.</p>
<P>"Not if I have something to say about it", said Monique turning on Olivia. Olivia stood her ground, she had just gotten the boy she was crushing on and there was no way this super bitch was taking him away.</p>
<P>"I believe Sebastian found something better",said Olivia putting her hands on her hips.</p>
<P>"Really?", asked Monique looking up and down the blond.</p>
<P>"Okay then",said Monique turning around to leave.</p>
<P>"Whoops I forgot I don't take orders from little miss perfect", said Monique turning around to slap Olivia across the cheek. Olivia bent down holding her cheek.</p>
<P>Olivia stood up just as Viola went to comfort her, Olivia gave Viola a wink and then charged Monique pushing her off the stage.</p>
<P>"CAT FIGHT!", yelled one of guys in the line, and a crowd gathered around the two.</p>
<P>Viola watched on in horror as Monique and Olivia fought each other, she was actually some what worried for Olivia, and after pressing a hand to her still warm lips, Viola began to realize why.</p>
<P>"Get off!"yelled Viola jumping off the stage and pulling Monique off Olivia, with some of Olivia's hair coming with Monique's grip.</p>
<P>Monique fought Sebastian till she ran out of steam, Duke ran in to grab Olivia before she made a lung for the recently defenseless Monique, not that Viola would have minded seeing Monique being served her ass in a fight, Viola just wouldn't risk Olivia's safety.</p>
<P>"Okay guys break it up", said Viola still holding onto Monique.</p>
<P>"Fighting won't solve anything", said Viola looking between the two girls.</p>
<P>Monique made one last thrash for Olivia and knocked Viola's wig off in the process, Viola's long hair fell just below her shoulders. Viola let go of Monique as she moved to recover her wig, but the damage was done. Everyone gasped as Viola stood up, pulling off her sideburns too, Monique pulled herself away from Viola and looked on in fascination as Viola moved towards Duke and Olivia.</p>
<P>Olivia squirmed free of Duke's grip, which wasn't hard given he head just witness his dorm buddy transform from a dude to a chick. Olivia looked hurt, as Viola neared her.</p>
<P>"Don't touch me!" yelled Olivia as Viola got closer.</p>
<P>"I don't even know who you are, Sebastian I mean...", said Olivia frustrated, that someone she had fallen for would lie to her. It was like everyone of her other relationships all over again.</p>
<P>"Viola", Monique spat out.</p>
<P>"Viola? Who's Sebastian?", asked Olivia.</p>
<P>"Sebastian's my twin brother, he left to play in england and I pretended to be him", said Viola looking down.</p>
<P>Viola moved closer to Olivia, who tried to back away but ran into Duke.</p>
<P>"Olivia I'm sorry.. really I am", said Viola.</p>
<P>"KISS HER AGAIN", yelled someone in the crowd.</p>
<P>"Heres a better idea", said Olivia, moving towards Viola and slapping Viola across the cheek.</p>
<P>"Owww", the crowd echoed.</p>
<P>Viola grabbed her red cheek and held it in pain. Olivia walked past the crowd as they made an opening for her, Duke looked down at Viola, shook his head and ran after Olivia. Viola could feel her heart break in that instant, but Monique came to make it worse. Monique walked past and took a picture with her camera phone, looking at the picture she smiled.</p>
<P>"Priceless", said Monique as she walked away, sending the picture to everyone she could think of.</p>
<P>"You did what?", yelled someone from behind Viola, Viola turned around to see her mother, arms crossed with an explanation beckoning expression on her face. Viola sighed and walked over to her mother, trying to fight back the tears she walked over to face her punishment.</p>
<P><B>Authors Note: Please read and review... next chapter will Viola try to get Olivia to listen? Will Olivia listen? Will Duke help out? And whats going to happen to the real Sebastian?</B></p>
