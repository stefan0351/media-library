<p>"I need those papers," Dillon said tersely.
"An hour. No, you've got an hour. You were supposed to have them last night, I
don't have time for this shit Bill. I'm not a fucking humanitarian, if I'm
going down I'm gonna claw viciously at you until you're bloody, broken carcass
is right there beside me ... and then I'm going to get mad," she continued
waving briefly to Jessie as she the blonde entered her office. "Ten o'clock. I
mean it. End," she finished throwing open the door to Jessie's office and
plunking herself down onto on of her chairs.</p>

<p>"You really aren't a morning person are
you?" Jessie asked having caught most of the other woman's conversation on her
way in.</p>

<p>"I've made no secret of that," Dillon
replied absently, her attention mostly focused on the cup of coffee Jessie had just placed
on her desk.</p>

<p>"Touch it and I'll kill you," Jessie replied
seeing the other woman's look and knowing without a doubt what was going through her
mind.</p>

<p>"Fine," Dillon sighed leaning back.
"How's the charity case going?"</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me she was a friend of
yours," Jessie commented, her full attention on Dillon now that she had brought up
Katie's case.</p>

<p>"Why would I have?" Dillon asked, "You knew
it had to be a favor."</p>

<p>"You didn't know did you?" Jessie asked her
attention focused on Dillon. The other woman had a tendency to be blasé on the cusp of
flippant most of the time, which meant that you had to watch her carefully to get any sort
of reading on how she actually felt about something.</p>

<p>"Know what?" Dillon asked looking at Jessie
shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take it? If she's a friend
of yours?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>"Your docket was clear, and I'm on the Falk case.
My dad did be favor by putting this one on tab, but he's not a saint. Falk
would've chewed serious ass if I'd dedicated anything less than one hundred
percent of my attention to him, so shipped it on over to you," Dillon replied leaning
forward. "Why is there a problem?"</p>

<p>"No, it's just ... we know each other,"
Jessie replied sighing and leaning back herself. "I was just wondering if that's
why I got the case."</p>

<p>"You know each other," the other woman repeated
to herself. "No, I didn't know that," continued her eyes back on Jessie.
"That's right, she's from Evanston too," she went on. "High
School?"</p>

<p>Jessie simply nodded wanting to get the subject off of
Katie now. Dillon was starting to dig and she didn't want to talk about it.
She'd seen the other woman carry out cross-examinations and wanted to avoid being on
the other end of one if it was at all possible.</p>

<p>"You were friends," Dillon continued when Jessie
didn't verbally reply. "That's obvious because you assumed that I may have
given the case to you because Katie could have mentioned you. What isn't obvious is
why..." she continued only to be interrupted by a beeping sound near her shoulder.
"Fox," she said her eyes clouding over as she concentrated on the voice coming
through the receiver. "Alright, I'll be right there. End," she said
standing up. "So we'll continue the inquisition later?" she asked Jessie
with a smile as she backed up towards the door.</p>

<p>"Not if I can manage to avoid you," Jessie
replied not bothering to look over at her. "As usual."</p>

<p>"You say the sweetest things," Dillon murmured
and then she was gone.</p>

<p>Jessie let out a relieved sigh and flicked her briefcase
open. She needed to get to work because she wanted to be out of the office by the time
Dillon finished whatever it was she had been called off to do. At least that's what
she told herself even though a voice at the back of her head insisted on nagging that
possibly she just wanted something legitimate to call Katie about.</p>
