<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 16 -->

<p>"Show me again?"</p>
<p>"Over there. I think that's the Archer".</p>
<p>"Looks like a bunch of stars to me", Brooke replied with a frown.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "I don't think many people would disagree with you".</p>
<p>"And mine is that group over there?" Brook asked, pointing.</p>
<p>"Yep, that is supposedly the Lion". Sam answered.</p>
<p>"How on earth did they get a Lion out of that?!" the cheerleader asked in amazement.</p>
<p>Sam smirked. "Beats me".</p>
<p>Brooke tore her eyes away from the so called Lion and glanced at the brunette above her.</p>
<p>"You seem to know a lot about this stuff."</p>
<p>Sam shrugged, still running her fingers through Brooke's hair. "When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the stars and the planets. I used to read everything about them."</p>
<p>"I had a thing for dinosaurs", Brooke admitted.</p>
<p>"You're kidding me?" Sam replied with honest surprise. "I would have pictured you surrounded by a million Barbies or something".</p>
<p>"Oh I had all that, but Barbie preferred to ride a T-Rex instead of driving a porshe", Brooke said with a grin.</p>
<p>Sam laughed, shaking her head. "You never cease to amaze me Brooke McQueen."</p>
<p>She gazed fondly at the blonde and realised that there was absolutely nothing else she would rather be doing. She quickly amended that thought.</p>
<p><i>Okay, almost nothing.</i></p>
<p>She blushed. Doing more naughty things would have been great but this was nice too. They had been outside for over an hour, relatively secluded from the rest of the party, with just each other and the night sky to keep them company.</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Mmmm?"</p>
<p>"I'm having a great time", Brooke said seriously.</p>
<p>Before the brunette could reply, Sam's mobile phone began to ring, startling them both.</p>
<p> "It's Carmen", she informed Brooke with surprise, before answering.</p>
<p>"Hello?.....we're outside....just talking....yeah, I'll tell her....okay....yeah....bye."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Brooke asked.</p>
<p>"It seems that Michael has been looking for you. He wants that dance." Sam said, trying, but not succeeding, in hiding her disappointment.</p>
<p>Brooke made no effort to hide her displeasure. "Fucking hell!"</p>
<p>Sam smiled. Yep, that pretty much summed it up. It made her feel all warm and tingly inside to know that Brooke clearly preferred her company to that dumb ass.</p>
<p>Sam's expression darkened at the thought of Michael, who she secretly referred to as "The lame ass version of Josh". He was popular, good looking and part of the football team, but he was also an arrogant bastard with the intelligence of a sock.</p>
<p>No offence intended to the sock.</p>
<p>Least, and worst of all, he had his eyes set on Brooke ever since news spread of her break-up with Josh and Sam didn't like that one bit.</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes and growled.</p>
<p>"My thoughts exactly", Brooke said with some amusement.</p>
<p>Sam gave her a sheepish grin. "Sorry".</p>
<p>"I don't want to move either." Brooke admitted. "I vote we run away, never to be seen again."</p>
<p>"That means we still have to move", Sam pointed out.</p>
<p>"Damn this god forsaken world!" Brooke yelled, shaking her fist in the air.</p>
<p>Sam laughed as Brooke stood up.</p>
<p>"The sooner I get this over with", she said, "the sooner we can get out of there."</p>
<p>She helped Sam to her feet but didn't let go, pulling the brunette into a hug and turning slightly to kiss her on the cheek.</p>
<p>"That's for being a comfortable pillow and for the wonderful head message", she explained shyly. "It'l be your turn next time".</p>
<p>She hooked her arm through Sam's and they slowly walked back to the hall.</p>
<p>It was a good thing Brooke did that, Sam decided, because she was almost positive that she was incapable of standing by herself.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam glared as Michael once again tried grabbing Brooke's ass.</p>
<p><i>That's it! I'm gonna kill him. </i></p>
<p>She slammed her drink down and started marching toward the couple, intent on introducing her fist to Michael's face. She had watched them dance to several songs, each time sculling down a Breezer.</p>
<p>She knew that the alcohol was affecting her judgement and encouraging her jealous rage but she didn't care. She couldn't stand to see them together any longer.</p>
<p>Attempting to reach her target destination, Sam's path was suddenly blocked when Harrison stepped in front of her with a smile.</p>
<p>"It's about time you've gotten on the dance floor! Where have you been?" He yelled, trying to be heard over the music.</p>
<p>"Out of my way. I've got a face to punch", Sam replied, trying to get around him.</p>
<p>"Huh? Whatever, dance with me!" He said, grabbing her by the waist, pulling her close.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You and Josh were getting a little hot and heavy", Carmen teased, nudging Lily with her shoulder. They were standing together on the sidelines, watching the dance floor with interest.</p>
<p>"Was not", Lily tried to deny, blushing. She looked away and noticed Sam and Harrison.</p>
<p>"Talk about hot and heavy, would you look at that!"</p>
<p>Carmen followed Lily's gaze and watched them for a few moments.</p>
<p>"They'd make a nice couple", she commented.</p>
<p>"Yeah", Lily agreed. "Though I don't think Alex would be pleased to hear that". She gestured at the dancing duo. "Or see that".</p>
<p>"Well, it's not as if things have been that great between them", Carmen pointed out.</p>
<p>"You noticed that too, huh?" Lily asked surprised.</p>
<p>"Of course. I mean, on the outside, everything looks fine but if you look closely..." Carmen trailed off, trying to organise her thoughts. "Sam loves him but I don't think she's in love with him. When she speaks of him there's no..." She paused. "There's no passion".</p>
<p>"I don't think the events of Friday lunchtime helped matters either", Lily replied.</p>
<p>Carmen nodded in agreement. "For some reason, Sam's trying to hold on but I don't think Alex truly realises what's happening. He is totally in love with her."</p>
<p>"Do you think there's someone else?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>They paused for a moment, contemplating the question. It wasn't too long after, that their eyes lit up as the exact same thought entered their heads.</p>
<p>"Oh my god!" Was all Lily said.</p>
<p>"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" Carmen asked, excited.</p>
<p>"That the so called foreign movie was actually a non-existent foreign movie?" Lily replied.</p>
<p>"Actually, my first thought was 'I wouldn't mind another drink', but yes!" Carmen cried out. "She's in love with someone else, and she was asking our opinions as to what she should do!".</p>
<p>"I can't believe it! Who could it be?" Lily asked, feeling like she was involved in the latest movie of the week thriller. She frowned as a thought came to her.</p>
<p>"Josh?"</p>
<p>Carmen waved that suggestion away impatiently. "He's got the hots for you. It isn't him".</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>"There's only one other real possibility" she continued mysteriously. "What other guy does she spend time with?"</p>
<p>Lily looked at the dance floor. "Harrison?"</p>
<p>Carmen nodded.</p>
<p>"Sam is in love with Harrison".</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Michael, touch my ass one more time, and I swear I'll give you a birthday present you'll never forget", Brooke threatened, pushing him away. "I've had enough".</p>
<p>She turned away to leave but he grabbed her by the arm and tried to apologize.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Brooke. I just really like you, that''s all."</p>
<p>She glared at him. "Let me go. Now".</p>
<p>He sneered at her, angry. "What? So you can go back to that bitch?"</p>
<p>He had planned to say many more insulting things but was left stunned by Brooke slapping him. Hard. He touched his face in shock and quickly looked around to see if anybody had noticed.</p>
<p>Due to the almost deafening volume of music and their position on the dark and crowded dance floor, nobody seemed aware of what had just happened and he was eternally thankful. He stepped back as Brooke moved closer.</p>
<p>"Don't you EVER call her that again" she said, shoving him in the chest.</p>
<p>He watched her walk away, then shrugged.</p>
<p>Women.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Just one more, Sam", Harrison pleaded.</p>
<p>"You said that three songs ago. I need to go and find Brooke", Sam said, pulling away.</p>
<p>He let her go, frustrated. "It's always about bloody Brooke."</p>
<p>She glared at him but decided not to comment, preferring to find the blonde instead. She tried to weave her way through the crowd, finding it difficult to move through the withering, grinding bodies.</p>
<p><i>And let's not talk about the darkness and the fucking flashing lights that are giving me a freakin' headache. Where the hell is she?!</i></p>
<p>She slowly made progress, stopping every so often to look around, even though it proved absolutely useless. She went to move again, but nearly jumped through the roof when a pair of arms encircled her waist from behind, pressing their lean body against hers.</p>
<p>"I've been looking for you", a familiar voice whispered in her ear.</p>
<p><i>Oh god.</i></p>
<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>"I saw you dancing with Harrison and went to get a drink. When I came looking for you, you weren't there", she explained. She tightened her hold on Sam, pressing harder against her.</p>
<p>"I've found you now."</p>
<p>She began to sway as another song came blasting over the speakers.</p>
<p><i>Sexy</i></p>
<p><i>Everything about you </i></p>
<p><i>So sexy</i></p>
<p><i>You don't even know </i></p>
<p><i>What you've got</i></p>
<p><i>You're really hitting my spot</i></p>
<p><i>Oh yeah </i></p>
<p><i>And you're so innocent</i></p>
<p><i>Please don't take this wrong</i></p>
<p><i>'Cause it's a compliment</i></p>
<p><i>I just wanna get with you girl</i></p>
<p><i>You gotta learn to let go</i></p>
<p><i>Oh baby won't you</i></p>
<p>Brooke placed her chin on Sam's shoulder, planting a soft kiss on her neck.</p>
<p>"Dance with me", she whispered hotly, grinding her hips against her. Sam didn't hesistate, covering Brooke's arms with her own, pressing back, molding her bodies even further.</p>
<p>She had never been so turned on in her life.</p>
<p><i>Work it a little</i></p>
<p><i>Get hot just a little bit </i></p>
<p><i>Meet in the middle </i></p>
<p><i>Let go</i></p>
<p><i>Just a little bit more</i></p>
<p><i>Just a little bit</i></p>
<p><i>Give me just a little bit more</i></p>
<p><i>Let me</i></p>
<p><i>I'll do anything if you just let me </i></p>
<p><i>Find a way to make you respond</i></p>
<p><i>I know you wanna break down those walls</i></p>
<p>Sam turned around, needing to see her face.</p>
<p>Using both hands to grab Brooke by the waist, she stepped forward and pressed herself against the blonde, so that no space lay between them.</p>
<p><i>And it's so challenging</i></p>
<p><i>Gettting close through</i></p>
<p><i>What I'm imagining</i></p>
<p><i>I just wanna seek it down</i></p>
<p><i>You've gotta let it all out</i></p>
<p><i>Oh baby won't you just</i></p>
<p><i>Work it a little</i></p>
<p><i>Get hot just a little bit </i></p>
<p><i>Meet in the middle </i></p>
<p><i>Let go</i></p>
<p><i>Just a little bit more</i></p>
<p><i>Just a little bit</i></p>
<p><i>Give me just a little bit more</i></p>
<p><i>Just a little bit more</i></p>
<p>She buried her face against Brooke's neck and closed her eyes, barely supressing a moan as Brooke's fingers tangled themselves in her hair.</p>
<p><i>It's so exciting</i></p>
<p><i>The way you're inviting me</i></p>
<p><i>I know you want to hit it like that </i></p>
<p><i>Can't get enough</i></p>
<p><i>Won't you satisfy my needs</i></p>
<p><i>Work it a little</i></p>
<p><i>Get hot just a little bit </i></p>
<p><i>Meet in the middle </i></p>
<p><i>Let go</i></p>
<p><i>Just a little bit more</i></p>
<p><i>Just a little bit more</i></p>
<p><i>Give me just a little bit more</i></p>
<p>Sam ran her hands down Brooke's strong back, grinding harder against her. She heard Brooke moan and pressed even more. She couldn't get enough.</p>
<p><i>Sexy</i></p>
<p><i>Everything about you so sexy</i></p>
<p><i>You don't even know</i></p>
<p>Sam opened her eyes as someone bumped into her, snapping her back to reality.</p>
<p><i>Fuck! What the hell am I doing!</i></p>
<p>She needed to stop this before she did something stupid, like kiss Brooke, which she was seconds away from doing.</p>
<p>Sam slowly, reluctantly stepped back, a mixture of arousal, shock and embarrassment on her face. She fought back the urge to jump straight back into Brooke's arms.</p>
<p>She gazed at her for a moment, speechless.</p>
<p>"I need...".</p>
<p>Brooke stepped closer.</p>
<p>"I need some air."</p>
<p>Sam walked away.</p>
