<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 17 -->

<p>Sam rubbed at her finger nervously as she scanned the hallway, left and
right, left and right.  After Brooke had left her room the afternoon before,
Sam had sat down and considered, at length, the reality of their situation
for the first time since she was swept of her feet.  She realized that the
social implications in regards to her were pretty negligible, as a part of
the school newspaper she only ranked just above the audiovisual club in
terms of nerdiness, and was about par with the drama club as far as what
people expected from her socially.  Basically, the reputation she did have
wasn't likely to suffer at the hands of any public exposure of her
relationship with Brooke.  And, with the recent developments in the whole
Nicole situation Sam was fairly certain that that public exposure-which
wouldn't really hurt her socially-would indeed come about.  That being the
case, there was only one thing that she really needed to take care of,
Harrison.  Whatever was going to happen with Nicole, whether good or bad,
was going to happen soon, of that Sam was sure, that meant that she had to
find Harrison and tell him what was going on before he could hear it from
someone else.</p>

<p>Honestly, she wasn't really looking forward to it, which was why she had put
it off for so long.  Harrison's infatuation with Brooke was no secret, the
fact that he was still infatuated with her was no secret, and when he found
out that Sam was sleeping with her, he was most likely not going to react
well to the situation.  Sam's relationship with Brooke wasn't a betrayal of
Harrison because there was nothing between him and cheerleader to betray,
but Sam knew that he wouldn't see it that way.  Still, he was going to find
out sooner or later, and it was better that it come from her no matter how
he reacted to the news.</p>

<p>So there she was, scanning the hallway for her friend so that she could
smash his heart into a million pieces.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam greeted sidling up to Harrison as he made is way down the hall.</p>

<p>"Where'd you come from?"</p>

<p>"Around the corner.  I was stalking you," Sam responded.</p>

<p>"I get that a lot," Harrison replied nodding along.  "What's up?"</p>

<p>"No idle chit chat with you huh?" Sam asked rubbing the back of her neck.
"Truthfully, I need to talk to you," she continued drawing up her courage,
lord knew she would need it.</p>

<p>"Sounds serious," Harrison commented observing her keenly.  She was nervous,
very nervous, that worried him because Sam wasn't easily unnerved.</p>

<p>"It is," Sam confirmed, she could feel her stomach tightening up and had to
pause for a moment to concentrate on breathing.  She was suddenly very glad
that Carmyn and Lily had saved her the trouble of having to go through this
with them, it was nerve racking as hell, and she hadn't even gotten to the
juicy innards yet.  "I don't want to talk about it here…are you free later?"</p>

<p>"I think my schedules clean, when and where?" he asked intensely curious
what she could possibly have to say to him.</p>

<p>"My house…no…yeah…um…no…wait, yeah," Sam responded haltingly.  "Yeah, my
house, around three, nobody should be home then," she finished.</p>

<p>"Alright, it's a date," responded checking his watch.  "Gotta jet, one more
late and they toss me in the dungeon," he continued speeding up and making
his way down the hall.</p>

<p>"In civilized society we call it detention," Sam called after him before
turning around and letting out a deep sigh, that was spectacularly
disappointing.  She didn't even want to think about what kind of reserves
she was going to have call up to make it through the actual conversation.</p>
