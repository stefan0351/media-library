<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 27: It's Only Natural -->

<p>Rebecca covered her eyes with her forearm as the bright morning
		sun beat down on her. Her head was pounding so hard she was sure everyone could hear it.
		Her stomach ached, her throat was sore, and she was certain she'd never rid her mouth of
		the foul taste. She felt the soft leather of the canteen press against her elbow.</p>

		<p>"Here," Josie said softly, although to the young woman
		it sounded much louder. Rebecca rolled onto her side, away from the offending sun and
		toward the woman who cared for her the previous night. She propped herself up on one elbow
		and took the offered water. With her eyes still shut tightly, Rebecca rinsed her mouth
		out, then took several long draughts before handing it back to the tall woman in black.</p>

		<p>"I feel awful," she moaned as she rolled onto her back,
		one hand reaching down to cover her aching belly.</p>

		<p>"You should," Josie said. "You were blind
		drunk." Her tone was not condescending, but it wasn't especially pleasant, either.</p>

		<p>"Sorry," Rebecca mumbled as she slowly opened her eyes.
		The gunslinger held out her hand and brusquely helped the young woman to her feet.</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, Rebecca. Just improve."</p>

		<p>The young woman let out an exasperated sigh. "Fine,"
		she said as she turned and headed for the brush. Josie's blue eyes flashed a hint of anger
		as she followed with deliberate steps. The instant they were out of earshot of the rest of
		the group, the gunslinger reached out and grabbed Rebecca by the upper arm, jerking her
		around to face her.</p>

		<p>"You listen to me, Rebecca. I'm not upset that you got
		drunk. It happens." From the look on the young blonde's face she realized the
		strength which she held her and eased up the pressure.</p>

		<p>"Then what?"</p>

		<p>"There's a time and a place for it. In the open with the
		possibility of a posse after us isn't it. What would you have done if something happened?
		By the skies above, girl, you can't even defend yourself," Josie said. She released
		her hold and ran her fingers through her raven hair, waiting for a retort from the young
		woman. Rebecca lowered her eyes for a moment as if lost in thought, then raised her head
		to face the gunslinger. Unsure what to say, the blonde nodded and stepped behind the
		brush. Josie turned and walked back to camp, but her ears still heard the ragged breathing
		that usually preceded sobbing.</p>

		<p>Rebecca returned a short time later, her eyes a bit puffier than
		usual. Without looking at the gunslinger, she headed for the coffeepot and poured a mug
		for both of them. She walked over to Josie and held out the cup as if holding a peace
		offering. The gunslinger took it and nodded her thanks before indicating that the young
		woman should sit down next to her. Stacey and Elaine approached.</p>

		<p>"Josie, we wanted to thank you for rescuing us and to
		apologize for getting Rebecca so drunk last night," Stacey said, her tone conveying
		her remorse. Elaine nodded. The gunslinger waved the apology off.</p>

		<p>"We'll escort you to Truth or Consequences. If we follow the
		river, we'll be there in less than a week," Josie said as she stood up and headed to
		her own wagon. Rebecca tossed the remainder of their coffee into the dying fire and
		quickly followed. Within a half-hour, the two wagons started their trek westward along the
		Rio Grande. Elaine and Victoria rode with Rebecca while Stacey and the others rode in the
		larger wagon. Josie rode further ahead on Phoenix, her eyes constantly searching the area
		for any sign of trouble. Elaine held Flossy's reins while Rebecca and Victoria rode in the
		back, using the short sides of the wagon as a backrest.</p>

		<p>"...so I moved to Rosewood," Victoria said, finishing
		her tale. She took the offered canteen from Rebecca and took a deep swallow. "So how
		about you? How'd you end up like this? Away from yer family and all." </p>

		<p>"I ran away," she replied, her gaze fixed on a knot in
		the wood on the other side of the wagon. There was a long pause before the blonde woman
		spoke again. "How did you...?"</p>

		<p>"Become a whore?" Victoria offered. Rebecca smiled, a
		bit embarrassed that she was even asking the question, and nodded. The brown headed woman
		took another sip of water and leaned her head back against the top of the wooden side of
		the wagon. "Well, I told ya that me daddy died. I had to feed myself someway."</p>

		<p>"What will you do now?"</p>

		<p>She shrugged as if to say there really wasn't much choice.
		"Prob'ly find me another whorehouse to work in."</p>

		<p>"But you have another chance!" Rebecca exclaimed.
		"You can do something else."</p>

		<p>"The only thing I'm good at is spreading my legs for men,
		Rebecca. I got no other skills." Victoria looked at her new friend and went on,
		"You're the lucky one. You got that big one to watch out for you. You'll be all
		right."</p>

		<p>Rebecca didn't know what to say. She knew she was lucky to be
		able to read and write and that she'd be dead by now without Josie. But she was still
		afraid that the gunslinger would grow tired of her being around and just leave her
		someplace. Shaking her head as if to clear the negative thoughts, she decided it was time
		to change the subject. An impish grin came to her face as she turned and whispered to
		Victoria, not wanting Elaine to overhear. Of course the older prostitute wasn't paying a
		bit of attention to the two young women in the back of the wagon. "What's it
		like?"</p>

		<p>"What?" Victoria replied. Rebecca turned a light shade
		of pink.</p>

		<p>"You know..." she looked down at her boots, totally
		embarrassed to ask. "...sex."</p>

		<p>The laughter that boomed from Victoria caused Elaine to turn
		around to see what was going on. From the wagon following, Stacey shook her head as if to
		say 'I don't know.' Elaine smiled and shook her head before turning around and paying
		attention to where she was going. Up in the distance, Josie kept Phoenix at a steady pace,
		never allowing herself to get too far ahead of the wagons.</p>

		<p>Rebecca knew without anyone telling her that her ears were bright
		red from embarrassment. "Shh," she hissed, poking the prostitute in the ribs.
		Victoria snorted and fought to bring herself under control again.</p>

		<p>"Heh heh, sorry, Rebecca," she said. "It's just
		that I ain't used to people not knowing about it."</p>

		<p>"I know what it is, Victoria," she hissed. "I just
		don't know what it's...like." Her cheeks became flushed again as her friend let loose
		another round of laughter.</p>

		<p>"I knew you was pure-like."</p>

		<p>"Will you stop?" Rebecca asked through gritted teeth as
		she looked around to make sure the others hadn't heard. If Elaine heard, she made no
		indication of it and Stacey's wagon was too far away, the noise of the wagons moving along
		making it impossible for her to hear what was making the young blonde so red.</p>

		<p>"Well..." Victoria said after she calmed down and took
		a swig of water. "...it depends."</p>

		<p>"Depends on what?"</p>

		<p>"Depends on who you do it with. Most men don't care about
		ya, so it's mostly boring. If ya want it done right, ya gotta count on rosy palm and her
		five friends," Victoria said as she held her hand out in front of her as if
		inspecting her fingernails.</p>

		<p>"Who are they?" Rebecca asked innocently, sending her
		friend into a bout of laughter and mirth so bad that tears were streaming down her cheeks
		before she could stop. Elaine turned to look at them. Victoria was holding her sides from
		laughing so hard and the poor blonde was scowling. "What is so damn funny?" she
		said, annoyed. "All I did was ask who Rosy Palm and her friends were." With the
		wagons stopped, all the women heard what was said and Rebecca found herself surrounded by
		hysterical women.</p>

		<p>"Ask Josie," Stacey called to the wagon in front.
		"I'm sure she knows exactly who they are."</p>

		<p>Josie looked back at the stopped wagons. There was no obvious
		sign of danger and no one exited either wagon so it couldn't have been a relief stop. She
		moved Phoenix closer and heard the peals of laughter. 'Great,' she thought as she rolled
		her eyes. The gunslinger let the horse nibble on the sparse grass for a few moments while
		she waited for the wagons to start moving again. Just as she started to head for them,
		Elaine snapped the reins and Flossy started moving again, most of the women having
		regained their composure. Rebecca quickly changed the subject to something she knew about
		while Stacey took pity on her and held her wagon back a bit, putting some distance between
		the blonde and the women who were still playfully ribbing her about asking the tall
		gunslinger who rosy and her friends were.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>When they stopped for a break, Josie took the opportunity to
		scout ahead, resting Phoenix further along the trail while waiting for them to catch up.
		Rebecca entertained the women with a story while they ate and soon everyone forgot about
		the question the blonde woman had for the gunslinger. The routine repeated itself at every
		break with Josie remaining far away until they finally stopped for the night. The sun was
		a bright orange in the lower western sky when the wagons were unpacked and camp was set up
		while Josie and two other women went to the river to catch some fish. The gunslinger used
		her knives, throwing them with deadly accuracy as she pinned one fish after another to the
		sandy riverbed before scooping them up and tossing them on the bank for the others to
		clean. One of the girls found some wild scallions growing on the edge of the river and
		quickly harvested them for the evening meal.</p>

		<p>Rebecca decided to wait and ask Josie after dinner. The
		gunslinger always seemed more relaxed after a good meal. Night had fallen and only the
		warm glow of the fire gave them any light. Josie tossed another log on the fire and
		settled back against the wagon wheel, mug of coffee in hand. Rebecca poured herself some
		and sat down next to her. "Josie, can I ask you a question?"</p>

		<p>"You just did," she replied as she brought the cup to
		her mouth.</p>

		<p>"Do you know who Rosy Palm and her five friends are?"</p>

		<p>Coffee sprayed from Josie's mouth, dribbling down her chin to
		soak her neck and shirt with the hot liquid as she looked at Rebecca in astonishment at
		the question. Howls of laughter were heard around the camp as the other women realized
		what had happened. The gunslinger leveled a stern gaze at them that although diminished by
		the lack of light, still managed to quiet the group down. She grabbed Rebecca by the wrist
		and pulled her to her feet, forcing her to follow her until they were out of earshot.</p>

		<p>Once Josie was certain they wouldn't be overheard, she stopped
		and released her grip on her friend's wrist. She kept her back to Rebecca. "What did
		they say to you?"</p>

		<p>"Well...I asked Victoria...um...about sex." She was
		beginning to seriously regret having asked the woman about the subject. "And she said
		that only those people knew how to do it right." There was a long pause before
		Rebecca spoke again. "Josie, do you know who they are?" She watched as the
		gunslinger scratched her head while obviously trying to find the right words to explain.
		She turned around and grabbed the blonde woman's wrist, turning the hand around.</p>

		<p>"You see this?" she asked, describing a wide circle
		with her finger in the middle of Rebecca's hand. "This is rosy palm, and
		these...." Josie pointed to her fingers and let her voice trail off as a look of
		almost comprehension came into the younger woman's eyes.</p>

		<p>"Oh," Rebecca said quietly, still not quite
		understanding. She wiggled her fingers and thought about what Victoria had said. It
		finally came to her just what they were suggesting Rosy's "friends" do, and
		Rebecca's eyes grew wide. "Oh!" she exclaimed.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's a natural thing. Everyone does it," she
		said, although she found herself unable to meet the eyes of her friend. "We just
		don't talk about it," she added.</p>

		<p>"Well...um...I see...okay, thanks for explaining that."
		She turned and started to walk briskly back to camp. It took only a few strides of the
		gunslingers longer, more powerful legs to catch up to her.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca," she said softly, turning her around to face
		her. "You don't have to be embarrassed about this."</p>

		<p>"W-we didn't talk about things like...like that."</p>

		<p>Josie put her hands on the younger woman's shoulders and gently
		squeezed. "Rebecca, listen to me. Nothing that feels that good can be that bad."
		She let go and took a step back, her face betraying no emotions. "We need to get back
		to camp," she said firmly, ending the discussion.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger was settled quite nicely into her blankets when
		Rebecca scooted up next to her and whispered in her ear. "Do you?"</p>

		<p>"Do I what?" the half-awake woman mumbled before
		realizing what she meant. "Oh, sometimes," she said matter-of-factly. "Go
		to sleep, Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Sorry, good night."</p>

		<p>"'Night."</p>

		<p>"Sorry."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." The gunslinger whispered in a low warning
		tone. The blonde quietly moved away and the only sound to be heard was the crackling of
		the banked fire and the soft snickers of the eavesdroppers to the conversation.</p>
