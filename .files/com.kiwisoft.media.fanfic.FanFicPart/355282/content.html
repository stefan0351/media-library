<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - What Would You Do For A Klondike Bar? -->

<p>Sam was partially right. A week later, Mike did ask Jane and Brooke to come
home but he had no interest in Sam whatsoever. To him, the young brunette simply
ceased to exist. He subscribed to the `If you ignore it it doesn't exist' school
of thought. Sam shrugged it off but both Jane and Brooke knew that Sam was
deeply hurt by it. They told Mike that they would not return to the Palace
without her and he reluctantly acquiesced but firmly stated that he did not at
anytime want to see or hear from Sam. Which was fine with her since the feeling
was entirely mutual. </p>
<p>Mike was also watching poor Brooke like a hawk. She was never at anytime
allowed to be in Sam's company alone. The locks were gone from their bedroom
doors as well as the bathroom door. Because of Mike's aversion to Sam, Jane had
to chaperone the two girls when they were home together. The three of them joked
that he probably wouldn't be happy to know that she let them kiss and cuddle
when they were together but it wasn't like they were going to tell him. Mike
didn't let them talk about the situation either. Whenever Jane or Brooke tried
to appoach him about the subject, he let them know on no uncertain terms whose
house they were in and where the door was. And dinners were and awkward
situation, filled with tense silences and stilted conversations. It reminded
Brooke and Sam of how things were when their families first moved in together.
It would have been funny, if it wasn't so damn sad. </p>
<p>So Sam was a non-entity. But you can only be invisible for so long until the
cosmic forces of the universe get bored and decide to make you visible to the
one person who hates you the most. And as such, Sam and Mike accidentally found
themselves home alone together one afternoon when Jane was at work and Brooke
was still at school. </p>
<p>"I hate my life," Sam grumbled as she walked in the door, home early because
the cold she was fighting finally won. Loaded down with books, she collapsed on
the couch and sneezed violently. She laid her head on the back of the couch and
promptly fell asleep. Mike walked into the livingroom a half-hour later and
stopped short. </p>
<p>"What are you doing home from school early? Or don't you go to school
anymore?" he asked angrily. Sam woke up groggily, the cold making her foggy and
stared at him for a second. </p>
<p>"'M sick, Mike. Nurse sent me home, k?" she responded as she tried to stand
up but her legs were wobbly and she ungracefully flopped back down to the couch.
Mike was untouched. </p>
<p>"Sure, whatever. I've been meaning to talk to you, Samantha," Sam arched an
eyebrow. Mike never called her 'Samantha' and he had barely given her the time
of day in two weeks and now he wanted to talk to her. (This can't be good) </p>
<p>"Sure," Sam answered weakly, really not feeling well. (Trust him to pick a
time when I feel like crap to get into a rumble with me) </p>
<p>"What do you get out of this?" he asked, his anger and outrage showing in his
voice. Sam's confusion and shock showed on her face. </p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Sam asked, trying desperately to keep up with
the conversation. </p>
<p>"Playing with my daughter's affections like this. What do you get out of it?"
Sam stared at him in absolute mute shock. Mike continued. "Is this some sort of
twisted plan on your part to finally destroy things between your mother and I?
Because I have to tell you, it's working pretty damn well, you've got her
believing that whatever you feel for Brooke is genuine. Let's face facts, Sam,
the only person you care about is yourself. So, tell me, what do you get out of
this?" Sam was still unable to form a pertinent response, whether it was from
the fever she was running or disbelief at the words she was hearing she didn't
know. Thinking he had hit the nail on the head, Mike laughed and kept going on
his little diatribe. </p>
<p>"See, you can't even answer me. You're preying on Brooke because she's
vulnerable right now. Harrison and Josh left her emotionally vulnerable and
you're taking advantage because you're sexually ambiguous not to mention highly
ambitious and willing to screw over anyone you have to to get what you want." By
now anger had propelled Sam to her feet and she slapped Mike hard across the
face. Her face was contorted in barely controlled rage. </p>
<p>"You ignorant, narrow-minded, homophobic, bigoted asshole! I swear all you're
missing is a white sheet! You have no idea what you're talking about! How
someone like you could have raised someone as loving and gentle as Brooke
boggles the mind. I am not using Brooke, I love her. If that's too much for you
to handle, well, then tough. I'm sick and tired of walking on eggshells because
you've got some sort of issues with your sexuality." </p>
<p>"Don't use that tone with me, young lady," Mike warned. </p>
<p>Sam flashed a feral smile. "Don't talk to me like you're my father, M-I-K-E," she enunciated the name
annoyingly slow. The room was beginning to spin and she knew she had to get up
to bed before the cold and fever knocked her off her feet and Mike threw her out
the door while she was unconscious. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to let you rip this family apart," Mike warned while wagging
his finger at her. If he wasn't so fuzzy, Sam figured he'd look funny. </p>
<p>"I'm not the one doing it, Mike," Sam said tiredly. "You are." She grabbed
her stuff and headed towards the stairs. </p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going? We're not finished here, young lady! Don't
walk away from me when I'm talking to you," Sam stopped and turned around for a
minute at the bottom of the stairs. </p>
<p>"Mike, I'm genuinely sick and need to rest. Whether you believe me or not, I
could care less. And we are finished because we're not talking, you're ranting,
raving, spewing homophobic hatred and ignorance and not listening to a word I
say. When you're ready to listen to reason, or at least calm down and remember
that you're the adult here, come talk to me again. Until then, leave me alone,
please." </p>
<p>Finished dealing with Mike for the time being and feeling worse with every
passing second, Sam climbed over the stairs and barely made it to her bed before
she collapsed, physically and emotionally exhausted. She quickly fell into a
feverish sleep and longed for Brooke to hurry home. </p>
