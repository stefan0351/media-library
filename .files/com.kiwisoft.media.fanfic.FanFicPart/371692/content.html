<p>A/N: Final chapter! Again, thank you for all who have read and/or reviewed my story!</p>

<p>Robby Ray stood proudly, arms linked with the second most stunning bride Lily had ever seen; Luanne looked magnificent in the wedding dress, identical to the previous bride to the average eye, but not to Lily. For her, Miley radiated beauty like no other. The piano music commenced for a second (and hopefully final) time that day. The murmur of the crowd died down as the pair began their walk down the aisle.</p>
<p>Jake stood at the finish line, adjusting his bowtie and desperately searching in vain through his suit's pockets for his Thundermint. He didn't mind so much that he had lost Miley, considering that Luanne could pass for her gorgeous cousin easy, except for the whole snorting thing. Jake was just going to have to get used to it.</p>
<p>Luanne and Robby Ray reached the platform and the anxious groom. The priest started making a long speech about how wonderful an occasion a wedding is and how there should always be more love in the world, etc. etc. Miley let out an exaggerated yawn, nudged Lily, and pointed to her watch, which made Lily let out an atrocious laugh. She blushed as all eyes turned onto the rude maid of honor.</p>
<p>"They're just jealous because you look better in a bridesmaid dress than any of them could," Miley comforted a red-faced Lily.</p>
<p>Lily blushed even more at the compliment and scanned the crowd, "Especially your Aunt Pearl, combat boots and dresses really don't mix."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>Lily could feel Miley fidgeting uncomfortably next to her as the ceremony reached the pinnacle "I do's."<p>The moment of truth arrived, "I, Jake L. Ryan, take you, Miley L. Stewart, for my lawful wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part."</p>
<p>To which "Miley" replied, "I, Miley L. Stewart, take you, Jake L. Ryan, for my lawful husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part."</p>
<p>The newlyweds kissed, and broke apart to wave at the crowd. Luanne let out a snort of pleasure and Jake looked at her with an uneasy smile, but brightened up when the professional photographer began snapping more pictures of the married couple.</p>
<p>"Leslie and Luanne, what a pair," Miley remarked with a little laugh.</p>
<p>"Who's Leslie?" Lily asked puzzled. Miley smacked her hand against her forehead, frustrated for letting Jake's real name slip.</p>
<p>"Uh, her pet pig, they like to go on walks together," Miley covered but Lily just gave her a knowing smile and let the issue drop.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>Summer Love blasted from the speakers as the wedding reception got underway. Jackson was hitting on some unlucky wedding guest but backed off when he saw her husband, Oliver was trying to rap his way to a record deal from some big exec at Jake's agent's company, and Robby Ray was having an arm wrestling contest with Aunt Pearl.<p>Lily giggled and rolled her eyes at Miley who was singing along with JT and pretending to pop her collar at Lily when she heard the lyrics "Make you wanna say my name girl."</p>
<p>"You are a dork, an adorable dork, and I love you for it," Lily complimented in between giggles.</p>
<p>"Good, 'cuz you're stuck with me," Miley replied and nodded her head to the beat as she incorporated some Hannah Montana moves into her dancing.</p>
<p>"Show-off," Lily muttered with a smile.</p>
<p>"No, just that good," Miley replied confidently and did a quick two-step to emphasize her point.</p>
<p>"You're starting to sound like Jake, maybe you should have married him instead," Lily joked but her smile faded when Miley immediately stopped dancing and merely stared at her with a hurt look on her face.</p>
<p>"Miley, I was kidding. I love you and I never want to lose you," Lily pleaded, panic rising in her heart.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" Miley asked quietly in a delicate tone.</p>
<p>"I love you, I swear on every star in the sky," Lily insisted firmly, suddenly afraid of losing Miley.</p>
<p>"Jake named a star after me, the same night he told me his secret. He had been honest with me so I knew I had to tell him my secret. That was years ago, we've been able to trust each other ever since," Miley reminisced sadly, "I've always trusted you with my secret, but you couldn't trust me with yours."</p>
<p>"Miley, it's not that I didn't trust you, I was just scared of losing you, I'd rather have you as a friend, never knowing how I truly feel, and watch you marry Jake Ryan, than lose you because I spilled my secret and you didn't feel the same way," Lily admitted, taking Miley's hands in her own.</p>
<p>"You'd really do that, watch me marry someone else just so I –," Miley began.</p>
<p>"Could be happy, yes, as long as you're happy, that's all I need," Lily told Miley with a sincere smile.</p>
<p>"Good thing you didn't let that happen though, to think I almost married Jake when you're the one I love,"</p>
<p>"You're sure about that?" Lily had the unavoidable urge to check.</p>
<p>"Remember what you told me when I called you up to my hotel room before I even walked down that aisle? You told me love is being with the one who can make you happy, and that's you, not Jake, not anyone else. You make me happy, I love you Lily, I swear on every breath I take," Miley said</p>
<p>"Every breath? Why not every star?" Lily pondered.</p>
<p>"The stars are for those who are still looking for the one they want to be with. I don't need to look away, I've got you right here," Miley said, blushing that it sounded so cheesy.</p>
<p><i>Awww, she's so sweet! I've got the romantic girlfriend; can this day get any better?</i></p>
<p>"So…Lily," Miley said nervously, biting her lip, "would you like to go on a walk with me, just the two of us, down the beach? I know of a hidden lagoon, it's less than a mile away."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Lilly squeaked out, a little too quickly, <i>and yes to my question, this day is definitely going to get even better.</i></p>
<hr size=1 noshade>It was a picturesque sunset, the ones that always appeared on postcards, and the happy couple soaked it in with a stroll down the beach. There were a sparse number of beach-goers left on the beach, most of them heading inside as it got dark, but a few did stop and stare at the two girls sharing butterfly kisses as they walking in the wet sand wearing bridesmaid dresses.<p>The sun's rays made a last burst of light that stretched across the canopy of clouds and reflected off the sparkling clear blue water, then slowly faded. The pair stopped walking and stood, hands entwined, alone in the dimly lit and secluded lagoon.</p>
<p><i>Now this is the happy ending that I've always wanted, I got the girl and that's all I need.</i></p>
<p>Miley wrapped her arms around Lily and bent in close so her lips were a inch away from Lily's sensitive earlobes and whispered seductively, "just because it's not our wedding, doesn't mean we can't have our own honeymoon."</p>
<p>Lily's face flushed with excitement and the girl let out a high-pitched "Eeeep!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade></p>
<p>A/N: YES I know it's not exactly straight out legal for Luanne to call herself Miley in the vows. But...since Jake's real name isn't Jake either, I figured by putting in the L. in his name for Leslie and then L. in her name for Luanne would constitute the legal bindings of marriage. Anyways...it feels fantastic to post the last chapter. I hope you liked this story as much as I loved writing it! I'm working on other stories but in the near future I plan on writing a sequel to this story, which will revolve around Lily and Miley's "honeymoon."</p>
