<!-- Complete \ Part 6 -->

<P>The words appeared to echo around the room as the silence extended. Both  women continued to stare at each other, trying to read the emotions splayed  openly across their faces. Almost involuntarily, B’Elanna took a small step  forward. Seven, her senses heightened by the situation, knew that B’Elanna was  going to move and stepped forward to meet her. The two women now stood well  within their intimate space boundaries but neither cared as their heads tilted  slightly to look into each other’s eyes, conscious that they were breathing the  same shared air.</P>
<P>In slow motion, B’Elanna raised a hand and drew her fingertips across the  ex-drone’s right cheek, brushing the splayed star implant gently before tracing  the outline of Seven’s finely chiselled cheekbone. Seven closed her eyes at the  touch and her breathing became ragged as B’Elanna’s fingers continued their  exploration of her face.</p>
<P>Sensing her reaction, B’Elanna allowed her right hand to rise and trace the  left side of Seven’s face, skimming her fingertips over the optical implant  above Seven’s closed eye, noting how pleasantly warm it felt, almost as if the  metal were alive. Her hands mirrored each other as she brought them across  Seven’s porcelain cheeks before drawing both hands lower to trace the full  cherry lips. Seven’s mouth parted slightly but B’Elanna resisted the urge to be  drawn in, completing her investigation of Seven’s features, touching every  millimetre of the trembling lips and continuing down to the strong jaw-line,  eventually letting her fingers rest at the Borg’s dimpled chin. Softly, she  brushed her thumbs across Seven’s lips again and then extended her neck to allow  their lips to meet. She ran her darker lips lightly over Seven’s with just the  hint of pressure as she kissed first the top and then the lower lip.</p>
<P>Seven’s mouth opened, and again B’Elanna resisted, drawing her lips across  her lover’s lower lip twice more, slightly increasing the pressure each time  before she felt Seven’s hand grip the back of her head and steady her. It was  only then that they finally crushed their lips into each other and pulled  themselves closer, arms snaking round one another, squeezing out the air that  separated them, moulding themselves into each other.</P>
<P>Seven drank the very essence of B’Elanna, her tongue tasting the honeyed lips  as it requested entrance. B’Elanna opened to her and she plundered the Klingon’s  mouth, exploring every crevice and folding her tongue round B’Elanna’s, noticing  absently how much rougher it felt than her own, revelling in the sensations her  lover was giving her. She sucked gently at the engineer’s tongue before  withdrawing slightly and nipping and sucking B’Elanna’s lips, pulling her ever  closer with one hand firmly behind the shorter woman’s head, her other wrapped  around her waist. She could feel the heat radiating off B’Elanna’s body and knew  that her own was just as hot and together, their heat was rising  exponentially.</P>
<P>Eventually, the instinct for oxygen became too strong for the lovers and they  pulled apart, gasping. Seven combed her fingers gently through B’Elanna’s still  damp hair as she gazed deeply into eyes hooded with desire. "I love you B’Elanna  Torres", she repeated softly, watching in delight as a smile lit up her  face.</P>
<P>"I love you too, Seven of Nine, Tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One", the  Klingon replied flirtatiously, earning a look of enchanted surprise from the  blonde ex-drone. She grinned mischievously. "What? Didn’t you think I’d pay  attention to your full title?" she asked in mock surprise.</P>
<P>"I am honoured that you remember my designation", replied Seven with genuine  reverence. She brought her head down and recaptured the smaller woman’s lips in  a kiss of searing passion. B’Elanna was consumed by the intensity of Seven’s  ardour. She returned the kiss with abandon, feeling her legs give way as it  continued and realising vaguely that she had been spun round and pushed against  a wall, one of Seven’s legs wrapped round hers tightly to keep her upright. She  hung onto her anchor and drank in every sensation, returning the passion  vigorously as her arousal escalated.</p>
<P>Seven could no longer hold back, desperate to touch B’Elanna’s soft caramel  skin and she ran her fully human hand gently down the silky neck, exploring all  the hollows and contours fully before easing her fingers under the fabric of  B’Elanna’s robe. She heard B’Elanna gasp and felt her increase the pressure of  their kiss. Sensing this as silent permission, she allowed her fingers to  continue the exploration, lightly dancing across the top of the engineer’s  chest, noting the start of the swell of her breasts and the valley between them.  She could feel B’Elanna’s skin, slick with ardour, react to her touch and her  hand continued, parting the robe further before she cupped the full weight of  B’Elanna’s left breast in her hand, running her thumb lightly round the dark  areola but careful not to touch the already hardened nub just yet. This touch  elicited a deep groan from B’Elanna and she arched into the contact, breaking  her lips away from Seven. She ached to be explored by this remarkable woman, her  desire pounding furiously at a lower junction.</p>
<P>Heady with the power she was exerting over B’Elanna, Seven teased a bit more,  tracing circles round the erect nipple before gently lowering her mouth, running  her tongue lazily over the pebble and then rolling it gently between her teeth.  She withdrew and continued her exploration with her mouth, sucking the full  breast and nipping at the soft tissue, her ministrations giving the golden skin  a rosy hue. At the same time, she used her Borg-enhanced left hand to tease  B’Elanna’s neglected right breast, squeezing the nipple slightly before kneading  the whole swell.</P>
<P>She heard a deepening growl from the Klingon and smiled into her task,  feeling her own excitement intensify, saturating the crotch of her bio-suit.  Suddenly, she felt B’Elanna move and she was spun around and pinned up against  the wall by a very breathless engineer. She grabbed Seven’s face and kissed her  fiercely, taking control of their interaction in one easy move as the ex-drone  found herself entranced by the display of power B’Elanna had just given. She  could think of no other person who could flaunt such power as gracefully and  deceptively as B’Elanna and her arousal responded to it instantly, her hands  running up and down B’Elanna’s back, pulling her into the embrace as the kiss  continued.</P>
<P>Breathlessly, B’Elanna pulled away from the ravaged lips, using her  fingertips once more to trace their outline. "Seven…my…love… are you sure?"  Unable to articulate the question any more clearly without introducing a sense  of doubt to the Borg, B’Elanna left the question deliberately vague.</P>
<P>Seven understood perfectly though and smiled as she traced the smaller  woman’s brow ridges, fascinated by their beauty. "I have never been so sure of  anything", she whispered softly, piercing B’Elanna with the intensity of her  stare.</P>
<P>The Klingon nodded slightly and then stepped away slightly from the  statuesque blonde, running her hands down Seven’s arms until she reached her  hands. She took them into her own, squeezed them reassuringly and then pulled  Seven towards her as she moved backwards towards her bedroom, unwilling to break  eye contact for even a second.</P>
<P>Seven followed, her breathing shallow, understanding the escalation of their  contact.</p>
<P>Instinctively, B’Elanna felt her way to the bed, turning her lover round so  that the back of Seven’s legs brushed up against it. She moved in closer but  tugged Seven close to keep her upright for a bit longer and brushed her lips  past Seven’s left ear, raking her tongue across the lower lobe before sucking it  into her mouth gently and nibbling for a moment. Her hot breath on Seven’s neck  made the Borg’s hair stand on end as B’Elanna whispered into her ear.</p>
<P>"…you’re over-dressed."</P>
<P>Reflexively, Seven shot her hand up to the back of her neck to release the  hidden clasp. B’Elanna grabbed the hand and led it back down to the drone’s side  before continuing to undress the Borg herself.</P>
<P>She worked her fingers under the fabric and pulled at the bio-suit gently,  parting the material slowly, pulling it inch by inch over the contours of the  ex-drone, and exposing alabaster shoulders to her vision for the first time.  Desperately holding onto her Klingon lust she continued to slowly peel back the  suit, releasing Seven’s voluptuous breasts before removing the sleeves from her  arms. The Chief Engineer paused briefly, drinking in the sight of Seven’s  perfect globes, brushing the back of her hands across them daintily before  sweeping her fingertips across the flat midriff, returning her hands to the  fabric. She had to lower herself down to strip the bio-suit fully from Seven and  she heard a gasp as she bent her knees to continue, keeping her face as close to  Seven as possible, inhaling her intoxicating odour. She marvelled as Seven’s  flesh responded to her hot breath.</p>
<P>Kneeling, she was now even with Seven’s hips and she steadied herself. Slowly  she revealed the creamy hips and golden triangle of curly hair, matted slightly  with Seven’s moisture. As the clothing passed her mound, B’Elanna’s nostrils  were assaulted by unleashed arousal and she paused once again, breathing deeply.  Closing her eyes, she savoured the sweet aroma that had been released.  Provocatively, B’Elanna continued her task, sometimes brushing her fingers over  the skin she uncovered, wondering at the silky smoothness of the curvaceous legs  that hid a powerful musculature.</p>
<P>She reached Seven’s boots and for the first time in what seemed an eternity,  she focused on her own hands, fumbling slightly as she removed the boots,  massaging Seven’s feet and ankles before moving her head back slightly, allowing  her eyes to examine the body she had exposed. She absorbed every feature, every  curve and every trace of Borg circuitry as her eyes steadily rose, eventually  making and holding contact with deep azure eyes that stared intimately back at  her.</P>
<P>Slowly B’Elanna stood up, extending her legs as she continued to fix Seven’s  gaze, delicately running her fingers over the milky white skin as she  straightened. Once upright, she slid her arms around Seven’s waist, raising her  hands behind her to caress her shoulder blades gently. Seven instinctively  wrapped her arms around the engineer as she bent down to join lips again. Their  contact was tender and slow, both women wanting their desire to now build slowly  together.</p>
<P>Imperceptibly, B’Elanna nudged Seven, easing her into a seated position on  the bed before pulling her up towards the head of the bed. Seven raised one leg  and dug a heel in to lever herself towards the centre of mattress, never once  breaking contact with B’Elanna’s lips and tongue, her head swimming with  want.</P>
<P>B’Elanna slowly straddled her lover, her black robe opening, as she placed a  leg either side of Seven’s hips. She broke off the kiss and sat back slightly,  running her hands over the curves of Seven’s breasts before kneading them with  more pressure, raking her fingernails across the painfully erect nipples. Seven  arched into the caress, her belly touching B’Elanna’s wetness and the ex-drone  groaned, appreciating how aroused they both were.</P>
<P>At this contact of her intimate flesh, B’Elanna growled deep in her throat,  convulsively clenching Seven’s ample breasts before making a conscious effort to  lighten her ministrations. She was not going to let her primeval Klingon  instincts take over. She smiled lovingly at Seven and adjusted her position  slightly, sliding down the beautiful Borg’s body, before lowering her lips once  again onto one of Seven’s breasts.</p>
<P>Soft, sensuous lips kissed and nibbled at the alabaster skin, turning it a  dusky rose as the area became aroused by the attention. Seven was truly in the  most exquisite torment, torn between the desire for her lover to continue her  ministrations and the paradox that somewhere far more intimate was pounding with  tension, demanding release.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was in no hurry to leave this paradise of flesh and she divided her  attention evenly between Seven’s firm globes, massaging one with a strong hand  as she lavished attention on the other with her lips, tongue and teeth, grazing  and nipping the flesh. She ran her tongue down the valley between Seven’s  breasts, lapping away the sweat that had pooled there as the Borg became  fevered.</P>
<P>Eventually, she trailed her mouth down, kissing and exploring every inch of  Seven’s tight abdomen, flicking her tongue into the hollow of the navel,  relishing the reaction as she continued her journey. The Klingon’s fingers  remained occupied too. Her right hand paid thorough interest in Seven’s lateral  implant, whilst her left drew lazy circles just underneath her breasts. Both  hands were eventually dragged lower as B’Elanna moved down, running her lips  over Seven’s curly blonde triangle, so close now to actually tasting her. Seven  curved up into B’Elanna’s lips at the touch and she ran her fingers through the  thick raven locks of her lover’s hair, desperate for release but not wanting to  rush her.</P>

<P>As her head paused over Seven’s sex, B’Elanna looked up with lidded eyes,  smouldering with desire. Her hands feeling the adjustment in posture, Seven bent  her head down to lock eyes with B’Elanna, her gaze totally trusting.</P>
<P>B’Elanna ran her hands down Seven’s body slowly before taking the ex-drone’s  and interlacing their fingers. She gave a reassuring squeeze as she rested their  locked hands on Seven’s abdomen and then used her elbows to spread her legs  further apart. She rested her forearms on the soft thighs as she gently lowered  her face into Seven, breathing the scent in deeply once more before placing her  lips onto the swollen folds of Seven’s mons. Delicately kissing them before  opening her mouth and running her tongue through the saturated tissues, she felt  her own moisture start to run down her thighs as she tasted Seven’s sweet honey.  Her tongue continued to lap the moisture as she cleaned the area around Seven’s  sex thoroughly, delving deep into the folds, and lower onto the baby-soft inner  thighs that glistened with evidence of Seven’s arousal.</p>
<P>Softly, she licked the lily-white skin, working back to Seven’s crevice,  feeling her blonde lover squeeze her hands in passionate encouragement. Slowly,  she ran her tongue from the back of Seven’s opening, right through the folds  using the flat of her tongue before the tip of it lightly caressed Seven’s  exposed clitoris, swollen with desire.</p>
<P>Seven bucked at the contact and B’Elanna squeezed their hands reassuringly as  she repeated the process over and over, delighting in the woman’s unrestrained  reactions. As she dragged the tip of her tongue over Seven’s bud, she swirled  round it and gave it more attention, taking it gently into her mouth and  suckling at it daintily, rolling it between her teeth before licking it again.  Feeling yet more moisture lubricate Seven’s folds, she refocused her attention  there before rolling her tongue to probe Seven’s entrance. She pushed in more  firmly and could feel the muscular walls clamp down on her tongue as she  explored Seven’s most secret place.</p>
<P>By now, Seven had clenched B’Elanna’s hands in a vice-like grip of passion.  B’Elanna knew that she could not easily release herself without breaking the  spell so she continued with just her tongue, exploring hungrily, applying firm  pressure with her arms to keep Seven’s hips under control as the Borg bucked  under her ministrations. She returned her tongue to Seven’s pearl, massaging it  with steadily increasing pressure while sensing that she was close to  release.</P>
<P>Seven could no longer control any of her thoughts and knew only on the  sensations B’Elanna was plying her with. There was a pressure building up inside  her that only the Klingon could liberate and every minute movement B’Elanna made  was assisting her. Her breathing came in ragged, forced gasps, almost as an  afterthought. The only thing she could focus on was the woman who was tearing  these sensations from her body and in celebration of her lover; she screamed  B’Elanna’s name in joyous rapture as her orgasm washed over her.</P>
<P>B’Elanna reacted by continuing her work. Drawing a second orgasm quickly out  of the trembling Borg and then a more protracted third, she let her down slowly,  wondering in the reaction she was extracting from Seven.</p>
<P>The lithe blonde shuddered slightly, trying desperately to get a hold on her  thoughts, as B’Elanna moved up to lie next to her, their hands still clasped  tightly together. She opened her eyes and turned her face to look at B’Elanna  tenderly before bringing their hands up and kissing them softly. B’Elanna smiled  at the gesture before putting her mouth to Seven’s and placing a chaste kiss  onto luscious red lips. Seven, tasting her own essence on B’Elanna’s lips,  responded quickly. She turned the innocent caress into a far more sensual  encounter, at last releasing the engineer’s hands in order to wrap her arms  round the coffee-skinned woman and roll on top of her, entwining their legs as  her hands fought to pull off the robe that still hung round B’Elanna’s  shoulders.</P>
<P>B’Elanna helped by rising up slightly and Seven yanked the garment off, at  last exposing the caramel body for her to delight in. She hesitated slightly,  scanning B’Elanna’s body, committing every curve and dip to her eidetic memory  before lowering her head to kiss the engineer voraciously once again, wanting to  return all the sensations she had just experienced to the dynamic Klingon.</p>
<P>Despite the unspent passion in her compact body, B’Elanna used her hands to  gently ease the ex-drone back and look at her wondrously. "Take your time," she  whispered. "We’ve got as long as you want."</P>
<P>Seven grinned as she realised that she had been rushing and instead turned  her thoughts to examining the dark woman’s face, running her fingers all over  her visage; mirroring B’Elanna’s initial actions. Gently, she hooked raven  tresses back behind the Klingon’s ears, pausing when she brushed over the  cortical monitor. She lowered her head closer to the silver shell-like  instrument and then placed her lips next to B’Elanna’s ear. "We’ve almost got  matching accessories," she whispered seductively, earning a loud peal of  delighted laughter from the engineer. It was infectious and Seven found herself  laughing with B’Elanna, burying her face into the Klingon’s neck to smother her  giggles. This made B’Elanna laugh all the more.</P>
<P>Eventually, the moment expired, and the blonde woman raised herself up onto  her elbows. "B’Elanna, I…" she began but stopped as she realised that she didn’t  know how to continue. The lithe engineer placed a gentle hand over the Borg’s  lips. "Shhhh. I know," she responded softly. Delicately, Seven kissed the hand  before reducing the distance between them and kissing the dusky rose lips. This  time, she let the passion build slowly, reacting as B’Elanna reacted, deepening  the kiss as B’Elanna sought more. She could feel the strong engineer wriggle  ecstatically underneath her and without breaking off, she rolled to the  diminutive woman’s left, running her borg-enhanced hand over the now exposed  breasts.</P>
<P>B’Elanna gasped and broke off the kiss as an almost electric sensation surged  through her. Seven grinned as she explained. "My enhancement can be used to  deliver some form of sensation as well as absorb it."</P>
<P>"Lucky you," B’Elanna grinned back at her lover easily. ""What sort of  sensation are you feeding me?"</P>
<P>Seven once again lowered her head to whisper into B’Elanna’s ear. "My  arousal."</P>
<P>B’Elanna groaned in delight and turned her face to capture the blonde woman’s  lips in a searing kiss. Slowly, inexorably, Seven’s hand travelled over the  small round breasts, running the back of her hand over the taut nipples again  and again, revelling in B’Elanna’s reaction and getting a heady sensation from  the feedback she was receiving through the borg-enhanced monitoring.  Reluctantly, her hand left the caramel globes and drifted across B’Elanna’s  midriff, marvelling at the rippling abdominal muscles she could feel under the  coffee skin.</P>
<P>Her hand journeyed further down, making small circles in B’Elanna’s belly  button before touching lower, brushing over the dark damp curls that covered  B’Elanna’s dripping sex.</P>
<P>Looking at B’Elanna lovingly, she trailed her fingers into the nether-lips,  relishing the moisture she found there and gently rubbing her fingers up and  down the Klingon’s valley until Seven found her entrance. She waited, cocking an  enhanced eyebrow for permission. B’Elanna bucked in response so she slowly  pressed two fingers in, pushing as far as she could in one fluid movement.</P>
<P>B’Elanna threw her head back and whipped her body up as she drove herself  into the touch. Encouraged, Seven gently began rhythmically pushing and  retracting her fingers. She could feel the pent up ardour through her sensors  and fed her own desires back into the sensitive area. B’Elanna arched even more  and Seven began to twist her fingers as well, adding a thumb to brush against  the hard swollen clitoris that had pushed out of its protective hood.</P>
<P>Relishing the sensation, Seven moved her head slightly and returned to  B’Elanna’s breasts, sucking and nipping ever harder as she felt the engineer  come closer to the edge. She somehow added a third finger and varied her  motions, twisting and pressing deep into B’Elanna’s core. She felt B’Elanna arch  again and was about to up the tempo once more, to take her to release, when she  realised something was wrong.</p>
<P>She was no longer getting feedback from her enhanced hand.</P>
<P>Raising her head quickly, she watched in horror as the engineer continued to  arch back, her face contorted in spasm, eyes open and unseeing before her whole  body wracked with paroxysm. Seven sat back in alarm and watched petrified, as  B’Elanna continued the seizure. Somehow, she managed to regain her senses and  leapt off the bed, scrabbling for her bio-suit.</p>
<P>Her hands wouldn’t work quickly enough as she searched the clothing for the  hard metal communicator pin. After an eternity, she located it and leapt to the  side of the convulsing woman.</P>
<P>"Medical emergency. Two to transport to Sick Bay immediately."</P>
