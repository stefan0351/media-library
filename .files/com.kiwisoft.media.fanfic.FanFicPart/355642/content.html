<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Four -->

<p>Kara stood at the edge of the parking lot of Lake Wenatchee, clad in her
			normal shorts and tank top, her unopened sketchpad still shoved under her
			arm.</p>
		<p>"Well, I think I?ve found the area?s hot spot," she murmured. Vacationers
			crowded into nearly every available space as multicolored tents dotted the
			shoreline and the lake itself was practically littered with boats. She could
			still sketch it, she supposed, but she was far too distracted now by all the
			clutter.</p>
		<p>She let out a heavy sigh, thinking she should have asked Louise more about
			the lake last night and saved herself a trip out this morning. She went back to
			her Land Cruiser and sat with the door open, the map spread out across the
			steering wheel. Doesn?t have to be a lake, she thought. There were just so many
			small ones tucked into the mountains that she hated to miss any opportunity to
			capture one in the perfect light.</p>
		<p>Without thinking, she reached for her cigarettes. She could always swing by
			the store and see if Ginny could recommend any. Maybe she?d be willing to show
			her around, too. She looked up and met her amused expression in the mirror.</p>
		<p>"No playing with the locals, Kara."</p>
		<p>She folded the map and headed back, stopping only once when she found a tiny
			dirt road leading off into the forest. The road stopped abruptly at a small
			clearing and an interesting creek flowed rapidly around boulders before
			disappearing into the trees. She watched it for a moment, wondering if the
			clearing was enough to capture the morning sunrise. It wasn?t too far. Maybe she
			would check it out one morning. She pulled out her notepad and scribbled down
			directions then turned the SUV around.</p>
		<p>As she approached town, she slowed when she neared the general store,
			pleasantly surprised to see Ginny walking along the road. She stopped and lifted
			a hand in greeting and Ginny walked over without hesitation.</p>
		<p>"Hi. How was the lake?" Ginny asked. She leaned through the open window and
			Kara met her green eyes briefly before looking away.</p>
		<p>"Crowded. Where're you headed?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"To the park for lunch."</p>
		<p>"Park?"</p>
		<p>"Just down the dirt road there," she said, pointing. "Have you eaten?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Want to join me?" Ginny asked. "You can have my apple," she offered.</p>
		<p>Kara tapped the stirring wheel with her thumbs and her mouth twitched in a
			slight smile. Why not?</p>
		<p>"Okay. Hop in."</p>
		<p>Ginny led the way to her usual picnic table and Kara followed, her eyes
			watching Ginny?s graceful strides and she remembered those same legs, peeking
			from beneath her robe last night. Now, they were covered in faded blue jeans.
			When Ginny turned, Kara quickly veiled her eyes and looked away.</p>
		<p>"This is a National Forest picnic area, but everyone in town just refers to
			it as The Park," Ginny said and slid onto the bench.</p>
		<p>"It's quiet here," Kara said. She looked around, finding only a few tables
			occupied, most with families, urging the kids to eat before returning to the
			playground.</p>
		<p>"Yes. Usually." Ginny unwrapped her sandwich and tossed her apple to Kara.
			"Sorry, but that's all I have."</p>
		<p>"It's fine. I usually forget to eat lunch, anyway." Kara rubbed the apple on
			her shirt, shining it, then took a large bite, feeling the juice slide down her
			chin.</p>
		<p>Ginny bit into her own sandwich, then looked up and watched as Kara licked
			the apple juice from her lips. Ginny felt nearly mesmerized by the sight of
			Kara?s tongue as it wet her lips and she stopped chewing and watched.</p>
		<p>"What?" Kara asked, sensing Ginny's gaze on her.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?" Ginny raised her eyes to Kara's blue ones and frowned, then bit into
			her sandwich again.</p>
		<p>Kara?s mouth moved into a slow grin, then she brushed it away. No playing
			with the locals, she reminded herself again. But there was something about the
			green-eyed woman that intrigued her.</p>
		<p>"So, what are you doing here, really?" Kara asked, hoping it was a safe
			question.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. Should she give the practiced speech she told everyone or
			should she tell this stranger the truth? She shrugged, opting for her
			speech.</p>
		<p>"When my grandfather died, I thought Nana would need someone to take care of
			her, so I used my inheritance from my mother and bought the store and moved."
			She shrugged again and tucked her hair behind her ears. "I moved here in
			October."</p>
		<p>Kara leaned her elbows on the table and met Ginny's eyes with a smile.
			"You've got that well rehearsed, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled too. "Is it that obvious?"</p>
		<p>Kara nodded. "And Phil?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm such a coward when it comes to him. He's really a sweet man, only he
			wanted to get married and I kept putting him off." She let out a heavy sigh and
			looked up at the trees. "He was getting restless, demanding."</p>
		<p>"Wouldn't take no for an answer?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"I mean, he wanted three kids, a house in the suburbs, the whole nine yards.
			I just wasn't ready," Ginny said. Then, almost to herself, "I wasn?t sure."</p>
		<p>"Maybe you just don't love him," Kara said, reading her thoughts.</p>
		<p>Ginny hadn't been able to tell herself that. After four years, surely she
			loved him. But something was missing and she felt like she would be settling if
			she just went ahead and married him.</p>
		<p>"Maybe I just don't love him enough," she allowed. "Maybe I've read too many
			romance books." She leaned forward and said softly, "I mean, I want that
			passion, that burning desire for someone that makes you crazy when you're not
			with them and crazier still when you are. You know what I mean?"</p>
		<p>"You're a romantic," Kara stated.</p>
		<p>"Maybe so. Maybe there's no such thing as that kind of love." Ginny met her
			eyes for a moment. "Have you ever had that?"</p>
		<p>Kara looked past her, into the trees. "No. Never," she said quietly. She had
			thought, once, that she had found it, but she had given up searching for it when
			Marsha left her one winter. She had been so involved in her painting that it was
			two days before she even knew she was gone. She pushed her thoughts back into
			her memory and forced a smile. "But I'm not really expecting it anymore."</p>
		<p>Ginny hadn't missed the pain that had flashed across Kara's face briefly,
			before she had hidden it, but she wouldn?t pry. They were only strangers. You
			don't bare your soul to strangers.</p>
		<p>"So, what did you do in Seattle?" Kara asked, looking for a safer
			subject.</p>
		<p>"I was in marketing. I designed ads. That's where I met Phil," she said. "We
			worked for the same firm."</p>
		<p>"So you quit your job and moved up here to take care of Louise?" Kara
			grinned. "And Phil had no idea you were running away?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, he had an idea, all right." Ginny laughed. "He said he would give me six
			months to come running back, then he was coming to get me."</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"And it's been eight and he'll be coming this summer." She sat up straight
			and tried to mimic his tone. "Ginny, you're not making sense. We love each
			other, it's only natural that we get married."</p>
		<p>"Have you ever tired the direct approach? Leave me alone, I'll call you if I
			want you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed. "No. The truth is, I don't want to hurt him. He?s done nothing
			wrong."</p>
		<p>"Maybe you're hanging on to him, just in case," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"Just in case what?" Ginny asked sharply.</p>
		<p>"In case nothing better comes along. At least you'll still have him," she
			said.</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head. "No. I would hate to think that's what I'm doing." She
			wondered if indeed Kara wasn't right though.</p>
		<p>Their eyes met across the table for an instant and Kara saw a spark of anger
			in the younger woman?s eyes, daring her to say more.</p>
		<p>Kara looked away but offered a smile. "I've upset you. I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>"No. Maybe you've hit on the truth and I don't like it." Ginny stood and
			tossed her bag into the trash. "Maybe I am simply hanging on to him for that
			reason. It would suck, but it may be true."</p>
		<p>"Well, it's none of my business, anyway," Kara said and stood and tossed a
			perfect strike into the trash can, her apple disappearing into the bin.</p>
		<p>They rode back in silence and when Ginny got out, she walked around to the
			driver's door and leaned in.</p>
		<p>"I'm not angry with you, Kara. I just haven't had a chance to talk to anyone
			about this before. My friends, they all think Phil is a wonderful man and that
			I'm insane not to marry him. Nana wants great-grandchildren and for me not to be
			an old maid," she said lightly. "I guess maybe you made me see things
			differently. And the truth sometimes hurts," she said quietly, her eyes again
			locking on blue.</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. "Again, I?m sorry. None of my business." She lifted a hand as
			Ginny stepped back. "Thanks for lunch. I'll see you around," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded and watched as Kara drove off. Through the back window, she saw
			her light a cigarette and she thought again that she had never met a woman quite
			like her before. Strong, independent, alone and seemingly happy. But she
			remembered the pain that had been on her face earlier, briefly, before Kara had
			hidden it. She wondered who had caused this woman pain?</p>
		<p>Kara savored her cigarette, her third of the day, as she drove slowly to her
			cabin. She should work, she thought, but she felt restless. She took a beer, one
			of only six she had brought with her, and walked into the woods to the property
			line. The old fence was in need of repair and she crawled through it easily into
			the forest beyond. She walked aimlessly, letting her mind drift. She had not
			thought of Marsha in a very long time, she realized. Kara had barely turned
			thirty-two when Marsha left. Her work was just catching on and her paintings
			were in demand and she had been very busy. Too busy to notice that she was
			neglecting Marsha and everything else in her life. They had met when she was
			twenty-six; Kara, a spoiled rich kid pretending to be an artist and Marsha,
			fresh out of college, trying to land a corporate job that would take her out of
			her parents shabby home in Tacoma. Marsha had been impressed with Kara's cottage
			on Bainbridge Island and even more impressed when she found out that Kara's
			parents had given it to her as a gift. Kara had gotten Marsha a job with her
			father's company and they had settled into their life with ease. And it had been
			fun, especially at the beginning. Kara had no worries. She sold a few paintings
			here and there and accepted her parents monthly allowance without guilt. But the
			more successful she got, the more it consumed her, this need to make a name for
			herself, to be a successful working artist. It had taken its toll on their
			relationship. Her endless travel during the summers, the endless hours of
			painting during the winters had been their undoing.</p>
		<p>And Marsha had simply disappeared from her life one day. When Kara realized
			what had happened, it had been too late to salvage things. Marsha had met
			someone else and Kara had let her go. There had been no one since. Oh, plenty of
			women had shared her bed, but none had gotten into her heart. Not that many had
			even tried.</p>
