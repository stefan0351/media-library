<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 15 - Near Confessions-->

<P>Disoriented, Seven climbed awkwardly up the rocky incline. Seven's right hand
shook as she tried to grab onto a small rock. Her balance was completely off and
she miss-stepped. Seven slid a rocky six feet to the cave entrance floor. A
shower of dust and dirt puffed up and partially covered the fallen half-Borg.
</P>
<P>Seven laid in a fetal position, holding her left shoulder, where a sharp rock
had cut deeply into the soft tissue. Instead of getting up, Seven simply stayed
in the fetal position. The emotions that racked her body were completely new.
Most of them were painful and Seven didn't know how to deal with them. </P>
<P></P>
<P>B'Elanna heard a loud crash echo through the cave. Startled, she quickly
grabbed her grey top and pants and put them on, leaving her underwear behind.
Still dripping from the shower, B'Elanna ran through the dark parts of the cave,
occasionally, bumping into the rocky walls. But she didn't care, her instincts
told her that something bad had happened. And Seven was probably hurt. </P>
<P>When B'Elanna rounded the corner, she saw Seven laying on the ground covered
in a thin layer of dust. Blood was dripping from Seven's left shoulder. B'Elanna
immediately bent down and checked if Seven was still conscious. "Are you okay?
What happened?" B'Elanna bombarded the dazed Borg. No answer. </P>
<P></P>
<P>B'Elanna placed her right hand behind Seven's head and held it up. Seven's
eyelid's were closed. B'Elanna tried opening one, but it immediately closed back
once she let it go. "Seven, wake up!" B'Elanna shouted. "You have to wake up!"
B'Elanna panicked. The half-Klingon's heart raced as she tried to think of what
to do. </P>
<P>After several bad ideas, B'Elanna settled on squeezing the excess water from
her hair onto Seven's face. The beautiful blonde immediately turned her face
from the cold water. "Mmmm... what are doing?" Seven mumbled, while shaking her
head. "I was trying to re-vive you." B'Elanna said, placing her arm around
Seven's back. "Here, sit up." B'Elanna motioned. "I do not require assistance."
Seven responded proudly. "The hell you don't." B'Elanna scolded. "You're
half-conscious, half-covered in dust, and bleeding from your left shoulder.
Don't tell me you don't require assistance." B'Elanna continued. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Seven didn't respond, surprised at the emotion the Lieutenant showed. "Here,
try sitting up against the cave wall." B'Elanna soothed, while half-lifting
Seven over to the wall. Seven settled into a comfortable position, knees up
against her chest, while still clasping her left shoulder. "Now, are you going
to tell me what happened, or do I have to interrogate it out of you." B'Elanna
asked, looking deeply into an ocean of blue. Seven looked down, unable to return
the stare. "Are you not already interrogating me." Seven responded like a hurt
child.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I'm sorry if it seems that way. I just wanted to know what happened so I
could help you." B'Elanna softly ran the back of her hand along Seven's cheek.
The beautiful Borg froze. Seven's mouth betrayed her and she let a small gasp,
eyes closed. B'Elanna quickly pulled her hand back, aware of what she had just
done. "Sorry, I didn't mean to..." B'Elanna blurted out. Seven blushed, and
continued to study the ground with her eyes. </P>
<P>"Um, how about I take a look at that wound." B'Elanna pointed to Seven's
shoulder. Seven removed her right hand to let B'Elanna take a closer look. "Wow,
that looks pretty bad. We should probably wash the wound before it gets
infected." B'Elanna said, concerned. "That would be the logical course of
action." Seven responded, while flinching at B'Elanna's touch. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Sorry, did that hurt?" B'Elanna asked in a worried tone. "Only slightly."
Seven lied, not wanting to reveal the real reason behind the flinch. "Okay, let
me help you to the waterfall so we can clean that wound." B'Elanna ducked her
head under Seven's left arm and placed her right arm around Seven's back. "Now,
on the count of three, we stand up." B'Elanna said. "One... two... three." The
two stood up in unison. </P>
<P>"Good. Am I hurting your arm like this?" B'Elanna asked about Seven's left
arm draped around B'Elanna's back. "No. It's fine." Seven lied again, wanting to
keep the closeness between them. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Good, otherwise I'd probably have to carry you like a bride, and I don't
think either of us would want that." B'Elanna joked. Seven's mind was suddenly
captured by that single image. Being carried to safety by the Lieutenant seemed
like a wonderful idea. Even if it did clash with her pride. </P>
<P>Seven's feet had stopped moving since B'Elanna mentioned the bridal joke.
"Hello, you there Seven?" Torres waved her hand in front of Seven's blank eye's.
"Look, I don't mind carrying you there against your will, but if your feet don't
start moving, then you're gonna have to live with that for the rest of your
life." B'Elanna half-threatened, knowing that Seven was the second proudest
person on the ship, next to the Captain. Of course B'Elanna wasn't far behind.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I will start moving my feet." Seven stated tentatively, not wanting to seem
inadequate. B'Elanna smiled, and began moving forward with the dazed Borg,
hoping they wouldn't meet any of the sharp rocks B'Elanna had ran into before.
</P>
<P>Turning the corner, B'Elanna could see she had left her bra and panties lying
next to the waterfall. "Oh my g.." B'Elanna cut herself off, while blushing
immensely. "Umm... I..." B'Elanna tried to think of something to say to ease the
embarrassment, but only partial sentences came out. Seven, meanwhile, observed
B'Elanna's underwear with quiet fascination. The blonde had seen something
similar in one of the Captain's holo-programs. From what Seven could tell, the
Lieutenant's panties were a simple white silk style, with matching bra. </P>
<P></P>
<P>B'Elanna's face grew redder when she noticed Seven eyeing her unmentionables.
"Silk?" Seven tried to confirm. "What?" Torres asked, shocked. "Are your
undergarments made of silk?" Seven asked again. B'Elanna's flushed face said it
all. "I... I... don't see what that has to do with anything?" The Lieutenant
managed to get out. "Am I embarrassing you?" Seven asked, almost back to her old
self. "Well, yeah. I don't usually talk to people about my underwear." B'Elanna
joked. </P>
<P>"I did not mean to embarrass. I only inquired about them because I do not
wear underwear" Seven stated. B'Elanna fought hard to keep her eyes from looking
down at the Borg's shapely figure. But her face was level with Seven's ample
bosom, and they were still holding onto each other. "That's nice to know."
B'Elanna laughed nervously. "How about we just sit you down next to the
waterfall, and we can wash that wound, okay?" Torres took a deep breath, hoping
to switch the subject.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Seven gingerly sat down on a flat rock next to the streaming water. B'Elanna
made sure to ask Seven if she was okay before letting go, secretly relishing the
contact. Turning around, B'Elanna quickly ran to pick up her bra and panties,
then squeezed them into a tight ball. Now the lieutenant was stuck with the
problem of where to put them. She cursed Starfleet for not putting pockets on
the standardized pants. </P>
<P>So B'Elanna just held them behind her back when she turned to face the
wounded Borg. The half-Klingon caught Seven's face going from extreme pain, to
one that tried to hide it. Immediately, B'Elanna dropped her underwear in the
water, scolding herself at being so inconsiderate of Seven's welfare. "I'm so
sorry." B'Elanna apologized, running to Seven's side and kneeling down next to
her. "For what?" Seven asked, trying to mask the pain. "For being more worried
about my underwear, than I was about you." B'Elanna said softly.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I do not require an apology." Seven stated. B'Elanna smiled, "I know you
don't, but I do." The Lieutenant paused and took a deep breath. "Ever since
you've joined our ship I've been a real bitch to you. I've always thought it was
because you were arrogant, but that was just an excuse." Torres bowed her head.
"An excuse for what?" Seven asked. </P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly looked up with tears in her eyes. "It was an excuse...
for..." B'Elanna tried to tell Seven the truth, but it wouldn't come out. So she
lied. "It was an excuse for me just being a bitch" B'Elanna said dejectedly.
"You see, I've never had many girlfriends. I usually see them as competition. So
we end up fighting, rather than talking." Torres wiped the tears from her eyes,
hoping Seven wouldn't see through her. "That is unfortunate." Seven responded,
shaken up by B'Elanna's tears. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Seven wanted so much to comfort B'Elanna, and almost reached out to touch her
cheek. But she didn't trust herself. Seven could tell that B'Elanna was hiding
something very painful, and knew that it was best not to push her on the matter.
So they silently stared into each other's eyes. </P>
<P>B'Elanna began to tear up again, seeing understanding in what she always
thought was arrogance. Seven's heart nearly broke when she saw B'Elanna turn
around, sobbing. So she slipped her arms around B'Elanna's waist and held her
gently from behind. "It's okay B'Elanna. I'm here." Seven whispered softly,
pressing the side of her face against B'Elanna's cheek. </P>
