<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Seeing Your Therapist -->

<p>Xena has returned from checking on the bees, and goes into the barn to find Farris dusting and polishing the wooden bit of Gabrielle's scrolls.</p>
		<p>"Glad I got you alone, Farris," she tells him. </p>
		<p>He smiles at her, delighted. "She let me touch her scrolls! She must really like me."</p>
		<p>Xena takes a deep breath then dives right in. "You know ... you don't stand a snowball's chance in Tartarus with Gabrielle. She's just being polite. And you've already got Rheta. She loves you, you know. Don't throw that away." </p>
		<p>Farris shakes his head. "I don't think you know Gabrielle as well as you think you do, Xena. But you don't have to worry ... when we're married, I won't make her give up her friends. You can come visit."</p>
		<p>Astounded, cursing under her breath, Xena goes in search of Gabrielle.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>As Xena comes out of the barn and looks across at the snakepit. Gabrielle isn't there. In fact the bard is crouching, clutching her staff, in a different pothole nearby.</p>
		<p>Xena frowns and shouts: "Gabrielle. Gabrielle." She moves to stand with her back to the pothole.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle straightens and leaps up at her with a triumphant yell. Xena merely steps aside ... and Gabrielle loses her balance on the lip of the pothole and starts to tumble backwards into it. "Oops!"</p>
		<p>Xena hastily grabs Gabrielle by the front of her BSGB and pulls her to safety. "What <i>is</i> it about you and holes, Gabrielle?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle: "You know, I would've had you if I hadn't done the war cry." </p>
		<p>Xena, unconvincingly, "Yeah, sure you would. It's your turn to talk to Farris."</p>
		<p>"Right ... Your snakes have escaped."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Gabrielle comes out of the hut, followed by Farris's shout: "My love for you will never die."</p>
		<p>She looks up the road and sees Xena in deep conversation with Rheta who is listening avidly and nodding her head. Xena is holding a sack (of fresh snakes).</p>
		<p>"Uh, okay. Thanks, Xena!" Rheta excitedly wanders off.</p>
		<p>Xena empties the sack into the snakepit and Gabrielle jogs up to join her.</p>
		<p>"What did you say to her?"</p>
		<p>Xena shrugs deprecatingly. "I just gave her some advice about handling men. I don't know if she <i>really</i> listened. After all, what do <i>I</i> know?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle nods, "Hmm."</p>
		<p>Xena glances at her. "How did it go with Farris?" </p>
		<p>"Not well."</p>
		<p>"That's one devoted fan you have there!"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle sighs. "The price of fame."</p>
		<p>Xena, wryly: "Yeah." She glances up at the sun and Gabrielle notices the gesture.</p>
		<p>"You want to use the mirrors after all?" she asks eagerly.</p>
		<p>Xena shakes her head. "No. I just wondered what time it was. Wish that giant would hurry it up. I'm fed up of catching more snakes."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Xena, Gabrielle, and Farris are idly waiting .... Gabrielle is composing another story, and Farris is watching her with admiration. Xena is sharpening her sword.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle says, "What's taking him so long?"</p>
		<p>"Stomping takes it out of a giant," says Xena. "He'll be here soon."</p>
		<p>"Where's Rheta?" asks Gabrielle, belatedly noticing her absence.</p>
		<p>"I hope she's taking that advice I gave her." </p>
		<p>The woman in question suddenly appears round the corner and they all gape at her. She is now a bleached blonde. And her costume has been radically pruned to mimic Gabrielle's. Unfortunately, her abs aren't <i>quite</i> as good as Gab's ... but her knees are. </p>
		<p>Farris blinks at her.</p>
		<p>She is carrying a scroll, and now she unrolls it, strikes a bardic pose, and begins to read: "I sing the song of Farris, the boy I knew, the man I loved ..."</p>
		<p>Farris regards her like one enchanted. When she draws to a close he says, "Whoa! Rheta! That was a<i>ma</i>zing! I had no idea you -"</p>
		<p>"Could write so well?" She gives him a provocative glance, turns on her heel, and heads for their hut. He follows her eagerly.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle is looking stunned. "That was my Perdicas story. All she did was change the names!" She turns accusingly on Xena. "Did you -" Fortunately for the Warrior Princess, at that very moment the ground shakes and distracts Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>"Griffith's here," says Xena, sheathing her sword and getting up. "I'd better go and meet him." She turns to Gabrielle. "If this doesn't work, if for some reason he doesn't step in the pit, I want you to get Farris and Rheta to safety."</p>
		<p>She rests her hand on Gabrielle's shoulder. "I'm sorry about the nighty, Gabrielle."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle nods and holds Xena's gaze. "And I'm sorry about Argo's hat."</p>
		<p>"We're even. It's time." Xena turns and rushes off. </p>
