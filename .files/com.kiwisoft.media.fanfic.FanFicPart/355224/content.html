<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Home is Where the Heart Is -->

<p>"Come on, Sam, try and show a little energy," Jane cajoled as Sam lagged behind. Sam rolled her eyes as she lifted another box and carried it into their new home. It was a nice house, more than large enough for Sam, Jane, and Mac. It had a spacious backyard for Mac to play in and came with a large swingset for her as well. The house itself was two floors, had cathedral ceilings and had a light airy feel to it. As an added bonus, it was only two miles from the Palace, a fact that Jane found very important not only for Sam but for Mac as well.</p>
<p>As much as Jane resented and nearly hated Mike for everything he'd done thus far, he was still Mac's father. And until Mac was old enough to decide for herself what she wanted, Jane wasn't going to deprive her daughter of her own father. Unless, of course, his violent streak appeared again. Then, all bets were off.</p>
<p>"It really is a beautiful home, Jane," Terri said as she helped bring a few things in. Jane smiled. She'd spent the past few weeks looking for just the right place. It became especially important after Brooke had come by and explained her theory of how getting Sam out of the motel and into a more stable environment might help her. The more Jane thought about it, the more she realized that Brooke was right. Sam and Mac both needed a home, not a rented motel room. Now, three weeks later and thanks to her friends in the real estate industry, they had one.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Jane said, turning to Sam who was standing nearby looking bored. "You like it, don't you, Sam?" Sam scowled.</p>
<p>"Whatever," she sighed. "It's not like it matters what I want anyway. Besides, any place is better than that damn motel."</p>
<p>Jane frowned. In recent weeks, Sam's attitude had turned from sullen and withdrawn to angry and snappish. Jane wasn't sure if it was a positive change or not. Brooke was still 'seeing' Tyler as a cover to see Sam as Tyler used it to see Catherine. It was an amicable agreement between the four that seemed to be working. It also seemed to be drawing Sam out more, which Jane was thankful for. But aside from that, Sam was growing increasingly hostile and Jane couldn't figure out why.</p>
<p>"Sam, it does matter what you want..." she started only to be cut off by a hot glare from her oldest daughter.</p>
<p>"Mom, reality check. If it DID matter what I wanted, we would still be at the Palace and I would still be with Brooke. So don't stand there and sugar coat the situation like I'm some sort of baby," Sam ranted angrily. "This isn't the life I want so stop expecting me to be thankful that I have it, OK?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Sam," Jane whispered trying not to cry at the hurt and anger in her daughter's voice. She knew the situation was bad and hated seeing how it was tearing at Sam. "I'll go get some more boxes."</p>
<p>"Sam," Terri said patiently when Jane walked out of earshot. "Give your mother a break. She's doing the best she can for you." Sam shot the blonde an irritated look.</p>
<p>"I know that," she said, barely keeping herself from snapping. "I just...I miss Brooke, OK?" Terri nodded.</p>
<p>"I know you do, hon. But it's not Jane's fault. And honestly Sam, you're blaming her for something that's beyond her control. You're being unfair." Sam reached up and rubbed the bridge of her nose. She knew Terri was right. It just didn't make her any less angry. Actually, it made her angrier.</p>
<p>"You know what's 'unfair'?" she growled at Terri, who listened glad to see some of Sam's spark returning. "The fact that I have had to move, not once, but twice because of Mike McQueen. First from the home I grew up in to the Palace and now from the Palace to here. When did HE suddenly start ruling my life? Fuck him! THAT'S unfair! I want my life back," Sam declared. Terri smiled. There was the Sam everyone told her about.</p>
<p>"Furthermore," Sam continued, her eyes lighting up as she vented. "I want my Brooke back, damn it. Father or no, he has no right to do what he's done. It's HER life, not his. He is NOT God."</p>
<p>"So what do you plan on doing about it, Sam?" Jane asked quietly from the doorway. Sam let out a long sigh, some of the wind being sucked from her sails at the question.</p>
<p>"I don't know," she shrugged. "I can't exactly pound on the door and demand that Mike let me see Brooke. It might end up detrimental to my health," she pointed out. Terri nodded.</p>
<p>"True. Mike is a tad unpredictable these days."</p>
<p>"And it's not just that," Sam continued. "I worry about what he might do to Brooke if he gets that angry again. I will not see her hurt." Just the thought of Mike harming Brooke was enough to make Sam sick.</p>
<p>"Sam, he never showed any violent tendencies towards her before," Jane reminded her.</p>
<p>"He never did to me either, Mom. Or you. But that day at Terri's, it wasn't me he went for. It was you and Brooke. I'm scared of what might happen if no one else is there and he's pushed too far."</p>
<p>"I see your point," Jane reluctantly conceded.</p>
<p>"So what now?" Terri asked while sitting down at the kitchen table. "Because as much as I hate to admit it, things can't stay the way they are."</p>
<p>"No, you're right. Mike's bound to figure out that Brooke's been seeing Sam and not Tyler," Jane added. "And when he does..."</p>
<p>"Exactly," Sam finished for her mother. She didn't want anyone to voice the rest of that thought.</p>
<p>"That's exactly what I'm worried about."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily moped down the hallway of the school. She didn't have enough energy to even try to put any effort into anything she was doing. She hadn't heard from Nicole in two days and she was worried sick despite reassurances from Carmen and Mary Cherry that everything was likely fine. She couldn't help worrying about her wayward lover. She missed Nicole so much.</p>
<p>(Where are you, Niki?) she wondered longingly. She'd tried calling the school Nicole was at but was only given the run around because she wasn't a family member. They wouldn't let her know where Nicole was and it annoyed her. She was getting really concerned that something bad had happened because Nicole always found a way to call her at least once a day. Lily missed hearing her voice and biting humor.</p>
<p>She walked out into the sunshine towards her car, a used 1996 Mazda that her uncle had given her to lift her spirits. She loved the car. It gave her a long overdue sense of independence and freedom. She couldn't wait to show it to Nicole and take the blonde for a drive in it.</p>
<p>"My Nana used to have a saying: If you're not careful, your face might freeze like that,'" a silky purr shook Lily from her daze. She looked up from her feet to see Nicole standing by the car, leaning casually against it, smirking from behind her sunglasses. Lily dropped her book bag in shock.</p>
<p>"Am I dreaming?" she whispered. One pale brow rose from behind the glasses as Nicole's smirk became a full-blown smile.</p>
<p>"Ooo, if you are, I hope it's an erotic one," she teased. She unfolded her arms and walked a few feet closer to Lily.</p>
<p>"Niki?" Lily asked, still not quite believing her eyes. Nicole removed her glasses and stared directly into Lily's eyes.</p>
<p>"It's really me, Lil. And I am VERY real," she promised, wrapping her arms around Lily's neck and pulling her in for a scorching but loving kiss. Lily melted into her and after a few moments, Nicole could feel Lily's hot tears staining her own cheeks.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, baby," she soothed as she gathered Lily close and rubbed her back. Lily quietly cried into her chest.</p>
<p>"I've missed you, Lily. Missed holding you, being near you," Nicole whispered as she nuzzled Lily's hair.</p>
<p>"Missed you too," Lily sobbed softly.</p>
<p>"Please don't cry. You're breaking my heart," Nicole choked out. Lily pulled away and saw the telltale tear tracks on Nicole's face and reached up to wipe them away.</p>
<p>"You're crying too," she pointed out lovingly. Nicole sniffled.</p>
<p>"Good Lord, don't tell anyone," she joked. "I'll deny it if you do. Allergies. I suffer from allergies." Lily laughed.</p>
<p>"Sure, good one. I believe you," she hugged Nicole again. "So when did you get home? HOW did you get home? I mean...I'm confused."</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry in the dining room with the candlestick," Nicole said cryptically. Lily stared at her blankly.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry called the boarding school and pretended to be a relative or something. Don't ask, I have NO idea how she hid that accent. Anyway, she fed them this whole line of BS about my Mom being sick and in the hospital and how I was needed at home. She even got a lawyer friend of her mother's to fax some phony paperwork over. I mean, I asked her for help but girlfriend went all out. I think she's missing her calling as a spy or something," Nicole explained.</p>
<p>"God, I never thought I'd be thankful to Mary Cherry for anything, never mind so much," Lily said. She stopped to think about that for a minute.</p>
<p>"You know, I'm not sure I like the idea of being indebted to Mary Cherry," she added warily. Nicole laughed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, me either. It's a scary thought."</p>
<p>"So where are you staying?" Lily asked as she rested her head on Nicole's chest and Nicole ran her hands through the Latina's hair. "There's no room at my uncle's or I'd suggest there."</p>
<p>"It's OK. That's the cool part I haven't told you about. My eighteenth birthday is in two weeks. On that day I stand to inherit a rather substantial trust fund that my Nana left me. She figured I'd need it before my twenties given the way my mother is. So, I just have to stay under my mother's radar until then. Once I have the money, I'll start looking at buying a place for us. Because when I say substantial, Lil, I mean SUBSTANTIAL."</p>
<p>"A place for us?" Lily echoed in a small voice. Nicole stroked the side of Lily's face.</p>
<p>"If you want that," she said, hooding her eyes and waiting for rejection. She was suddenly very insecure and Lily found it endearing.</p>
<p>"Of course I want that, Niki. I was just surprised," Lily clarified. Nicole's face lit up.</p>
<p>"Then we'll get a place, just us," the blonde declared happily.</p>
<p>"What about until then?" Lily asked. Nicole sighed.</p>
<p>"I guess I could stay at Mary Cherry's," she said, her voice betraying how she really felt about that. As thankful as she was to the Texan for all her help, she still didn't want to live with the slightly off balance girl. Lily's eyes lit up as another idea occurred to her.</p>
<p>"I think the McPherson's have a couch with your name on it."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"So you and Brooke have secretly been seeing each other? You sneaky little bitches," Nicole teased Sam at the McPherson's kitchen table later that day. Jane had been more than willing to lend Nicole one of the spare rooms for the time being. Sam was rather indifferent to the idea but she was glad that Lily was so happy.</p>
<p>Nicole immediately noticed Sam's attitude. The girl was a walking storm cloud, scowl firmly in place. There was no denying that Sam was one angry young woman. And while Nicole was in no way intimidated by her, she didn't want to set her off either. She actually wanted to help find a way to ease Sam's anger and straighten out the whole mess.</p>
<p>"Whatever works," Sam said with a shrug as she absently picked at her dinner. The brunette was thinner too, Nicole noticed. Another sign that things were not going well for her.</p>
<p>(Damn you Mike McQueen) Nicole swore. (You've caused more than your fair share of hurt and heartache. I hope you get exactly what you deserve)</p>
<p>"Hey guys!" Brooke chirped as she and Terri walked through the door.</p>
<p>"Brookie!" Nicole hugged her best friend tightly. "God, it's good to see you."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you're finally home," Brooke said.</p>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p>"Brooke, does your dad know where you are?" Lily asked a tad fearfully. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No. He thinks I'm out to dinner with Terri," she explained as she walked over to Sam. "Hello Beautiful," she purred, her voice dropping an octave.</p>
<p>Nicole watched amazed as Sam's dark mood lifted the moment Brooke stepped into the room. And the kiss the two shared was fiery and passionate.</p>
<p>(Those two are perfectly matched) Nic decided. (And incomplete without the other. Who would have thought?)</p>
<p>Brooke helped herself to a seat on Sam's lap and then proceeded to start eating Sam's dinner. Sam wrapped her arms around the lanky blonde's waist and sighed contentedly.</p>
<p>"Sammy, you've hardly touched your meal," Brooke scolded. Sam shrugged behind her.</p>
<p>"Not hungry," she said simply. Brooke looked at Nicole, her expression conveying her concern. Nicole nodded her agreement.</p>
<p>"Eat," Brooke ordered while bringing a piece of chicken up to Sam's mouth. Sam reluctantly did as she was told.</p>
<p>"Well, we'll leave you four to catch up. Terri and I rented 'Shakespeare in Love.' We'll be in the den watching it if you need us," Jane said.</p>
<p>"Behave yourselves," Terri added with a lopsided grin and a wink as she left the room.</p>
<p>"Please, it's not even six o'clock. How much trouble could we possibly get into?" Nicole asked innocently. Sam snorted.</p>
<p>"Oh, enough," she pointed out as the others giggled.</p>
<p>"So, Nic, how was Switzerland?" Brooke asked while she continued to try and get Sam to eat something. She finally understood what everyone else went through with her and her eating disorders. While Sam wasn't that bad, Brooke was still beside herself with worry over how the other girl was doing and wanted to keep her healthy.</p>
<p>"Beautiful...but boring," Nicole said. "The country itself is breathtaking but it's not where I wanted to be."</p>
<p>"Now you're home," Lily sighed happily taking Nicole's hand into her own and squeezing.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am. And happy to be so. It's funny but I have to wonder about my mother's rational for sending me there in the first place."</p>
<p>"How so?" Brooke wondered.</p>
<p>"Well, think about it: she sent her openly gay daughter away from her lover. OK, I can understand that. But she sent me to an ALL GIRL'S BOARDING SCHOOL. Uh, hello, Hon? NOT exactly the most logical move." They all giggled again at the obvious truth.</p>
<p>"Now, granted I only have eyes for Lily here, but HEL-LO! Mother of God, some of those girls! How does one concentrate on school with that sort of distraction? It was like English class, math...oh look shiny. I was suddenly Rainman at inopportune moments," she joked.</p>
<p>"Hmmm, a fox in the hen house, eh?" Sam cracked. Nicole arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"Are you calling me a 'fox,' Spam?" she teased. Sam crinkled her nose.</p>
<p>"As if. The only 'fox' I see here is Brooke," Sam responded, sneaking her hands under Brooke's shirt and teasing the surprised cheerleader's skin.</p>
<p>"Saaaaaam," Brooke chastised. Nicole rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"God, nothing changed. Sex crazed weasels," she sighed. Lily leaned over and nibbled on the shorter blonde's ear.</p>
<p>"Rainman, huh?" Lily whispered. Nicole shivered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah definitely," she gasped.</p>
<p>"So," Brooke's voice broke them all from their less than pure thoughts as she batted Sam's hands away. Sam huffed at her annoyed. "Now that we're all back on the same continent, what now?"</p>
<p>Silence hung over the four as they thought about their situation. Lily and Nicole would be on their own in a matter of weeks, free from their overbearing parents trying to run their lives. But Sam and Brooke weren't so lucky. Brooke was still trapped by Mike and no where near her eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p>"I haven't a clue, B," Nicole admitted. "I wish I knew how to help."</p>
<p>"Well, let's get the two of you straightened out and then we'll worry about Sam and me," Brooke suggested. "Maybe by then, an answer will present itself."</p>
<p>"Either that," Sam started, her voice dark and laced with bitterness. "Or things will get even worse."</p>
