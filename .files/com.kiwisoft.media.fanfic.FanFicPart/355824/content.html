<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ The Cat Finally Jumps -->

<p>I tiptoed back toward my room. I always seem to pick the wrong bloody times to walk in on the two of them. Of all times to run out of fresh towels in my bathroom.</p>

		<p>I closed my door behind me and leaned against it.</p>

		<p>That was the first time I ever heard him admitting to having feelings for me.</p>

		<p>We've talked about it before, when Missus Crane made all those claims during the divorce. But he dismissed it offhand. Didn't even pause to consider it. I suppose I've always known that he was attracted to me. That was hard to miss. But... true feelings?</p>

		<p>"I'll probably never stop thinking about her."</p>

		<p>He thinks about me.</p>

		<p>Often, I assume.</p>

		<p>Oh, good Lord.</p>

		<p>I suppose I've known since Christmas that he has felt something, but... well, he doesn't exactly act as though he does. And he's been so wrapped up with Mel. He barely takes notice of me when she's in the room. So it was never really real until... well, now.</p>

		<p>But now that I think about it, there's always been something.</p>

		<p>Even just in the way he says my name.</p>

		<p>He doesn't say it like everyone else. I know it sounds ridiculous, but most people just slide over each other's names. You say enough of a name to identify and then leave it. So everyone either calls me "Daph," or they slide over both syllables as if they were one, which results in "Daph" with a slight "n" tacked onto the end.</p>

		<p>When he says it, it's different. It's reverential, almost.</p>

		<p>He says it slowly and purposefully, enunciating it clearly. And he lingers on the first syllable in a wonderful way.</p>

		<p>And he always smiles when he says it.</p>

		<p>Isn't it strange that we've been thinking about the exact same bloody line from the same bloody play. That's got to be a sign.</p>

		<p>Oh, for God's sake! Listen to me! I can't do this! I'm getting married in three weeks!</p>

		<p>....And now he's giving up.</p>

		<p>I thought that nothing was more determined than a cat on a hot tin roof?</p>

		<p>I guess I was wrong.</p>
