<p><i><b>A/N: Dedicated to Atlantic-wolf because...well, because!</b></i></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"A dance!" exclaimed Lilly after breakfast the next day. She and Miley were in arts and crafts, half-heartedly sanding the wood for their tie racks. "Well, what do you know? The first decent activity they've come up with!"</p>
<p>"Calm down," said Miley. "If they let us go, which I doubt after yesterday, then we won't be around there long enough to do any dancing. Escape, you know."</p>
<p>"Aw, Miley, we'll never get away. They'll watch us like hawks. After our performance yesterday, we'll probably be bound and gagged and nailed to the wall of the dance hall!"</p>
<p>"I have it all figured out scientifically," said Miley, her eyes gleaming. "Biologically, in fact. You see, Silver Lake is a boys' camp. Therefore, they have male clones. Once the dancing starts our clones, being of the female persuasion, will devote all their attention to the male clones. With the loud music and everything, we could probably stand at the door and wave and yell 'toodle-oo' and they'd never notice us. That's if we go at all. I have a feeling Trina won't let us."</p>
<p>"But that's not fair!" shouted Lilly. "I want to go!"</p>
<p>Chantel ambled over. "What's all the yelling about?"</p>
<p>"World politics," said Miley firmly.</p>
<p>"The dance, right?" grinned Chantel.</p>
<p>"They're not going to let us go!" yelled Lilly. "It's not fair! I want to go!"</p>
<p>"Everyone's going," said Chantel. "Even you two."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Lilly, embarrassed. "Oh, well, that's all right then."</p>
<p>"What about you, Stewart?" asked Chantel. "Don't you want to go?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged indifferently. "Well, we're going to be eating there, and the food just has to be better than here," she said. "But I don't dance."</p>
<p>Chantel laughed out loud. "The last thing you didn't do was play soccer, and you managed ten goals!"</p>
<p>"I don't dance," repeated Miley stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Sure," said Chantel sarcastically. "Keep sanding those tie racks." She walked away.</p>
<p>Lilly looked at Miley. "<i>Do</i> you dance?"</p>
<p>"Only at gunpoint."</p>
<p>"No, I mean <i>can</i> you dance?"</p>
<p>"So I'm told," said Miley.</p>
<p>If Lilly had not known better, she would have been sure she saw a distinct flush on Miley's cheeks.</p>
<p>"I just hope I'm doing the right thing," said Trina at a mid-afternoon impromptu counselors' meeting. "I mean, I know Stewart's going to try to run away. I know it. You know it, Marina—we all know it. Why on earth are we taking her to the mainland?"</p>
<p>"Maybe the boys will keep her there," suggested Marina hopefully.</p>
<p>"She says she doesn't dance," offered Chantel, "if that's any comfort."</p>
<p>"She's probably the world's greatest dancer," muttered Kitty.</p>
<p>"Well," said Chantel, "take this for what it's worth: Truscott wants to dance. If Truscott doesn't try to run away, Maybe Stewart won't."</p>
<p>There were murmurs of agreement.</p>
<p>"But we can't count on that," said Trina anxiously. "They have to be watched every second!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Marina. "It'll be all right."</p>
<p>"I wish I could believe that," moaned Trina.</p>
<p>"You," accused Miley, "have been combing your hair for fifteen minutes."</p>
<p>Lilly grinned. "I've got to look good," she argued.</p>
<p>"Why is Trina letting the nut go?" complained Ashley, washing her face. "She'll wreck the whole dance!"</p>
<p>"Keep scrubbing your face, Ashley," said Miley genially, "and maybe some of the twit will rub off."</p>
<p>"Shut up!" snapped Ashley. "Hey, what's that awful smell?"</p>
<p>"That's Amber's perfume," said Sarah, wrinkling her nose.</p>
<p>"How long until it's our turn for the launch?" asked Lilly. "Maybe I've got time to take another shower."</p>
<p>"You're as clean as it's possible to be without being boiled," said Miley. "Besides, we've only got five minutes. Come on."</p>
<p>At five o'clock that afternoon, the girls of Algonkian Island, scrubbed and shining, marched happily into the dining room of Camp Silver Lake. Lilly Truscott was the first to rouse the boys' curiosity, as she was being personally escorted to her seat by Kitty and Ruby. But their attention was almost immediately diverted by the arrival of six tall counselors who stepped inside and arranged themselves on either side of the door in military fashion. Then in marched Miley Stewart, sandwiched between Trina and Marina, each one with a hand on her shoulder. The remainder of the Algonkian counselors brought up the rear. Trina and Marina led Miley to a vacant seat beside Lilly and sat her down.</p>
<p>Miley looked around the table of boys and girls. "Maximum security," she explained.</p>
<p>Lilly laughed. "If my parents had seen me escorted here under guard…"</p>
<p>"My parents would have thought it was par for the course," commented Miley dryly.</p>
<p>"All right," said Trina, smiling broadly. "I'm Trina."</p>
<p>"And I'm Jack," replied a counselor from Silver Lake.</p>
<p>"And I'm already bored," murmured Miley.</p>
<p>Lilly snickered.</p>
<p>"Quit that, Truscott!" snapped Trina. "Now, one by one, let's hear your names."</p>
<p>"Amber."</p>
<p>"Sarah."</p>
<p>"Reed."</p>
<p>"Mike."</p>
<p>"Lilly."</p>
<p>"Hannah."</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart!</i>" yelled Trina. "Don't fool around!"</p>
<p>"Oh, all right. Miley."</p>
<p>Mike turned to Reed. "Miley's hot," he whispered.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Jack when they had finished, "let's see who remembers all the names. How about you, Miley?"</p>
<p>Miley blinked twice and began to recite with computer accuracy: "Amber, Sarah, Reed, Mike, Lilly, myself, Thomas, Ashley, Emma, Jack…" She paused and stared at Trina in perplexity. "What was your name again?"</p>
<p>"Trina! <i>Trina!</i>"</p>
<p>"So much for bird calls," said Miley. "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Oh, stop it, Stewart!" Trina turned to attractive, blue-eyed Jack. "Okay, how do we go about getting some food into this lot?"</p>
<p>"Intravenously?" suggested Miley.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed except Trina, who sighed deeply. "Stewart…" she warned under her breath.</p>
<p>The kitchen staff began to arrive with huge platters of hot dogs, hamburgers and french fries. Soon everyone was happily eating.</p>
<p>"Can it be?" said Miley faintly. "Yes, it is—food. Real food."</p>
<p>All the boys laughed, including Jack.</p>
<p>"Don't they have real food at Algonkian?" asked Thomas.</p>
<p>"Only a little swill now and then," said Miley, reaching for a hot dog. "Served in a trough, of course."</p>
<p>"Come on, Stewart," said Trina a little angrily. "These people will think Algonkian's a terrible place."</p>
<p>"The public has a right to know," said Miley solemnly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, even Trina, although she was obviously forcing herself to do so.</p>
<p>"So," began Jack amiably, looking around the table, "what do you girls do for excitement at Algonkian?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well," said Amber, "we play a lot of sports—you know, baseball, soccer and all that stuff."</p>
<p>"And we swim," added Ashley. "That's excluding Stewart and Truscott, of course. They sit around all day and play chess."</p>
<p>"Eat!" commanded Trina. She felt her dinner sticking in her throat. Things were not going to be comfortable until Stewart and Truscott were back on Algonkian Island. This was going to be a long evening.</p>
<p>Escorted by Trina and Marina, Miley Stewart entered the recreation hall and immediately walked over and seated herself on a corner bench. The hall began to fill up, and before long the lights were low and the music was pounding its heavy, floor-shaking beat.</p>
<p>Lilly sidled up to Miley. "You're not going to sit here all night, are you?"</p>
<p>Miley glanced casually at Trina, who was dancing with Jack but keeping an eye on the bench. Then, deciding there was no possible way Trina or anyone else could overhear her, she replied, "No, I'm not going to sit here all night. You see that door over there? Somehow, in the next hour or so, I'm going to be out of it and gone. Are you coming?"</p>
<p>"Aw, Miley," whined Lilly, "I like it here!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," said Miley patiently, "but you have to remember that after <i>here</i>, you go back <i>there</i>. The cell door closes and you're back to square one."</p>
<p>"Yeah," argued Lilly, "but—"</p>
<p>"It's up to you." Miley shrugged.</p>
<p>"I'll go," said Lilly quickly. "What do I have to do?"</p>
<p>"I haven't thought of that yet," said Miley. "Just watch me. I'll signal you."</p>
<p>A group of boys, led by Thomas, Reed and Mike, arrived on the scene and seated themselves around Miley.</p>
<p>"Hi, Miley," said Thomas. "We're curious about you."</p>
<p>"In what way?" asked Miley absently, raising a disinterested eyebrow as she checked out the opportunities for escape.</p>
<p>The blonde boy shrugged. "You're different. For instance, your counselors treat you like a prisoner. How come?"</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> a prisoner," said Miley. "We all are, only some of us notice it more than others."</p>
<p>"Aren't you enjoying yourself?" asked Mike.</p>
<p>"Hardly," said Miley blandly.</p>
<p>"That's because you're not dancing!" exclaimed Reed. "Come on, guys! Let's get her out on the floor!"</p>
<p>Lilly watched open-mouthed as the group, which had now grown to eight guys, dragged Miley bodily out onto the dance floor.</p>
<p>"I don't dance," Miley was saying, her calm unruffled.</p>
<p>"Dancing is easy," insisted Reed, swaying to the beat of the music. "This is all there is to it." The rest of the boys began to dance as though demonstrating.</p>
<p>The idea suddenly occurred to Miley that only by dancing was she going to get off the bench and out from under Trina's scrutiny. She began to move in time to the music with a perfect technique and agility that left everyone gasping. Her hands slid through her hair, and her slim athletic body gyrated to the beat of the music as if she had been born and raised in its rhythm.</p>
<p>"I worried about her," Lilly muttered darkly to herself. "Now she's got eight partners." Her throat was dry from watching Miley dance. She didn't like the way the guys were looking at her friend.</p>
<p>"You were holding out on us," laughed Reed. "You're an expert. Stick with me and we'll knock 'em dead!"</p>
<p>"I don't dance," insisted Miley. She dropped to the floor and rose up again in a move that left all the guys' mouths hanging open.</p>
<p>Chantel walked over and leaned against the wall next to Lilly. "Our friend Stewart is full of surprises," she commented.</p>
<p>Lilly grinned. "You'd be surprised."</p>
<p>Chantel laughed. "If she's not careful, somebody might think she's enjoying herself."</p>
<p>"Ha!" said Lilly. The thought of Miley Stewart enjoying anything that had to do with camp was absurd. "Miley hasn't changed expression since the day she arrived at Algonkian."</p>
<p>"I stand corrected," said Chantel. "Look at her now—dancing up a storm with seven or eight guys and looking as bored as if she were reading the telephone book. How do you figure her?"</p>
<p>"I don't," said Lilly. "And we're still friends. I have a feeling that's why."</p>
<p>"Hey!" came a shout from across the room. Trina had glanced towards the bench and found it empty. "Where's Stewart?"</p>
<p>"Take it easy," soothed Jack, her dancing partner. "There's your Stewart right over there, dancing with my entire group—and can she ever dance!"</p>
<p>Trina stared in amazement and then broke into a joyous laugh. "Well, what do you know? We finally found Stewart's weakness—men! Stewart has a weakness for men!"</p>
<p>"I'd say the men have a weakness for Stewart," laughed Jack.</p>
<p>"But she's having fun," insisted Trina. "Stewart doesn't have fun. At least not until now. This is fantastic!"</p>
<p>"I'm glad," said Jack sarcastically. "Now maybe you'll relax and have a little fun yourself."</p>
<p>The club-style song suddenly changed, and the beat was now a heavy hip-hop type. Miley glanced at Trina, who was looking right at her. She started walking back to her bench, but was immediately grabbed by at least three guys. Her heart sank.</p>
<p>"Oh, no you don't," Mike said, "we want to see how you'll dance to some real music."</p>
<p>Miley glared at him, but nodded her consent. Her eyes landed on Lilly, who had found a tall, tan dance partner named Rick. They were dancing close to the group.</p>
<p>Thomas dropped to the floor, performing some kind of complicated breakdance routine. Miley allowed the beat to sink into her, and when Thomas stood up again, she started her uproc. On the downbeat, she kicked her legs out, doing a 6-step and going straight into a windmill-to-headspin. Amidst cheers, she launched herself up from a handspring back to her feet again, standing and dancing back into the crowd.</p>
<p>"I hope I didn't look too ridiculous," Miley said in a bored voice.</p>
<p>"You looked great," Rick assured her. "Who taught you to dance?"</p>
<p>"A mixmaster," replied Miley. "Say, Lilly, I'm planning to invent a new dance. It's called The Exit. Are you with me?"</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed hard. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"It sounds super," raved Rick. "Will you teach it to me?"</p>
<p>"Uh—"began Lilly.</p>
<p>"Sure," said Miley. "First we start to dance towards that door."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Rick. "That kind of exit. Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Home, never to be seen again in these parts. Come on, Lilly, we're starting now." She turned to her several partners, who had all heard bits and pieces of the conversation through the din of the music. "Thank you very much for the dance. It's been nifty."</p>
<p>Before the boys' astonished eyes, Miley and Lilly danced off, weaving in and out across the packed dance floor towards the door. Miley opened the door and shoved Lilly outside. Then, executing a devastating triple spin, she was gone as though in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>"Hi, Stewart." Chantel was sitting in a comfortable lawn chair facing the recreation hall exit. "I kind of figured you'd be along soon." One hand rested easily on the arm of the chair. With the other hand she held Lilly Truscott tightly by the belt.</p>
<p>A smile almost showed itself on Miley's passive face, and her eyes gleamed in the darkness. "Curses," she said mildly, "foiled again."</p>
<p>Chantel turned to Lilly. "You said I'd be surprised. I wasn't. Well, now—do you consider yourselves officially caught, or the minute I let go of Truscott do you both take off?"</p>
<p>"Try me," said Miley softly.</p>
<p>Chantel laughed into the darkness. "I think I will." She released Lilly, reached behind the chair and produced two more folding chairs. "Sit down," she invited. "We're going to talk about all this."</p>
<p>The two girls sat down. Miley glanced at Lilly. "Remember—name, rank and serial number."</p>
<p>Lilly giggled nervously.</p>
<p>"Come on, Stewart," said Chantel. "You're not talking to Trina now. If you're trying to drive <i>me</i> crazy, you'll have to do a little better than that."</p>
<p>Miley raised both eyebrows and looked mildly interested.</p>
<p>"As you can see," began Chantel, "I've thought of everything. And I've even figured you out, Stewart. You—"</p>
<p>From inside the recreation hall came three sharp whistle blasts, followed by Trina's half-demented voice screaming, "Stop! Stop the music! Stewart's gone! Stewart's goooooone!"</p>
<p>The heavy beat of the music stopped abruptly, to be replaced by a louder, horrifying sound. Pandemonium broke loose in the dance hall. There were shouts and the sound of running feet. The door burst open and out stampeded all the Algonkian counselors, Trina in the lead.</p>
<p>"Trina! Marina! Stop!" cried Chantel. "<i>Wait—"</i></p>
<p>Nobody looked at her sitting there with the two girls.</p>
<p>Behind the counselors swarmed all the Algonkian girls, laughing, shouting and hooting in the night. The Silver Lake boys and their counselors came last, happy and laughing in spite of their confusion.</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"It's got to be that Miley Stewart."</p>
<p>"You mean the weird girl?"</p>
<p>"She's the hottest girl I ever danced with!"</p>
<p>"Let's go find her!"</p>
<p>"Maybe if we find her we can keep her! They sure don't want her!"</p>
<p>"Hey," announced Thomas triumphantly, "here she is—sitting right here!"</p>
<p>"Hi, Miley," said Reed. "Come on back inside. We haven't finished our dance."</p>
<p>"I don't dance," said Miley quietly.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh!" moaned Chantel. "That Trina! How are we going to round everybody up?"</p>
<p>"Obviously you <i>didn't</i> think of everything," said Miley righteously. "But Lilly and I can go along and help you look for everybody. Right, Lilly?"</p>
<p>"Right," squeaked Lilly.</p>
<p>"No way, Stewart. If I could trust you two, I'd be able to go find them myself."</p>
<p>"Why don't you leave them with us?" suggested Jack.</p>
<p>Chantel looked at him, a slender figure surrounded by ten or eleven Silver Lake boys. Everyone else was gone on the search. Then it occurred to her that it would be justice to leave Stewart here. They would make her dance, something Stewart seemed to hold on a par with baseball and soccer.</p>
<p>"That's a good idea. Thanks," said Chantel, turning to go.</p>
<p>The gleam in Miley's eye faded abruptly. "Take us with you," she said, rather more quickly than was usual for her.</p>
<p>"No," laughed Chantel. "I wouldn't want to spoil your fun. You go in there and dance. And in case Trina forgets to mention it, that's five more days work detail for each of you." She ran off into the darkness.</p>
<p>Jack and the boys ushered Miley and Lilly inside the recreation hall.</p>
<p>"Come on, Miley," said Jack enthusiastically. "Teach me how to dance the way you do."</p>
<p>"Do I have an alternative?" asked Miley.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Jack with an endearing smile. "Push-ups."</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "Would somebody please put on a song?"</p>
<p>The counselors' meeting back on Algonkian Island late that night was a spirited affair. With the exception of Chantel, all the counselors were in a state of rage brought on by a two hour intensive wild goose chase.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow," roared Trina, "Stewart dies! I don't care about my job! She dies!"</p>
<p>Chantel laughed in her face. "Don't be ridiculous. Stewart didn't throw you in the lake. You fell in—you and Marina and Kitty and Ruby."</p>
<p>"That's enough out of you," snapped Marina. "Why didn't you tell us you were right outside the rec hall with Stewart and Truscott?"</p>
<p>"A millimeter to the left," retorted Chantel, "and you would have tripped over us. Why didn't you look?"</p>
<p>"It was dark," lamented Kitty. "And nobody told me there was a lake!"</p>
<p>"That's why they call the place Silver Lake," Chantel explained patiently. "Because there's this lake—a silver one."</p>
<p>"Now you're sounding like Stewart," warned Trina. "Don't you dare sound like Stewart or tomorrow you die too!" She brought her fist down to pound on the table, but it landed in the pot of hot soup that had been prepared for the four wet counselors. "<i>Ow!</i>"</p>
<p>"Do you expect me to eat that now?" growled Marina.</p>
<p>Chantel was hysterical with laughter.</p>
<p>"I'd like to know what's so funny, Ms. Arts and Crafts!" demanded Clementine of Cabin 1. "I chased a squirrel up a tree because I thought it was Stewart. I fell and almost killed myself!"</p>
<p>"And wait till Lauren gets back tomorrow," said Ruby. "When she phoned she didn't sound too pleased that we forgot her there. She was sprayed by a skunk, you know, and that's no picnic! She's got no change of clothes, and they won't even let her into their wash station to clean up!"</p>
<p>"No more," moaned Chantel, rolling in her chair. "I don't want to hear any more! Please!"</p>
<p>"What about me?" cried Jenny of Cabin 18. "I'm lucky to be alive! I ran into a bear in those woods! A real bear! If I hadn't kicked at it and scared it away—"</p>
<p>"<i>You!</i> Was that you?" shouted big Lucy. "That was <i>me</i> you kicked! Me! I'm not a bear!"</p>
<p>"Then why did you reach for me?" cried Jenny.</p>
<p>"I thought you were Stewart!"</p>
<p>"I'm going to write a book about this!" raved Chantel. "It'll be a best-seller!" Tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"And as if I hadn't been through enough," finished Trina as though no one else had spoken, "I get back to the rec hall soaking wet and looking like an idiot and what do I find? Stewart, dancing with Jack—<i>my</i> date! It's too much! I tell you, it's the end!"</p>
<p>The meeting lapsed into angry silence. Trina clenched her fists, Kitty sneezed violently, Jenny and Lucy scowled at one another, and Ruby lapped sulkily at a bowl of soup. Chantel wore a grin that stretched from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Finally Marina spoke. "If I wasn't so filled with anger, hatred and self-pity, I swear I'd be laughing my head off!"</p>
<p>Lucy's scowl bloomed into a toothy smile. "Jenny thought I was a bear!"</p>
<p>"I kicked her!" guffawed Jenny.</p>
<p>"And all for nothing," said Ruby quietly. "Stewart didn't even get away. How about that?" She broke into gales of laughter.</p>
<p>"Lauren!" snickered Marina. "We forgot Lauren!"</p>
<p>"She's always complaining she never gets off the island," added Chantel hysterically. "When she gets back, she'll never leave again!"</p>
<p>The merriment was contagious, and soon all the counselors, with the exception of Trina, were roaring with laughter.</p>
<p>"What's all this stupid laughing?" Trina shouted. "What's so funny?"</p>
<p>"Us!" howled Marina breathlessly. "We almost killed ourselves! Silver Lake thinks we're a bunch of crazy savages! And it was all for <i>nothing!</i>"</p>
<p>An odd look came over Trina's face. Ridiculous. So ridiculous. Everything had gone wrong. Everything. Four guys in the lake. Jenny kicking Lucy. Clementine up a tree. Lauren, sprayed and stranded. And Stewart, the cause of it all and yet not really responsible, dancing her way through the whole insane business. Stewart was so—so funny!</p>
<p>She threw her head back and began to laugh, not just at the events of the evening, but at everything. That Stewart!</p>
<p>The beaver lay at peace on a bed of soft pine needles and gazed upon his masterpiece. At last, the dam was completed. And a beautiful dam it was, constructed with all his skill. He sensed rain in the air, but it would still be a day or two before it came. Then his dam would be tested.</p>
