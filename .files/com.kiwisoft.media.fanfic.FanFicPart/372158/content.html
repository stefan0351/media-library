<P>a/n: well so I just realized I have nothing else to do tonight, and I'm not tired, and I don't have to be up at 8 o'clock in the morning tomorrow…sooo I'll write another chapter! Cause I'm just in the mood to write tonight.</P><P>Chapter Five: As I Am</P><P>'Miley and her family seem really close…just from what little I know about them already I can tell…it's weird. I'm use to my crazy broken up family, and them they've got this perfect little picture family. I'm almost…jealous.' I thought to myself as I watch Miley with her dad as they talked to the vet and the vet checked on the little filly foal that was just born.</P><P>"She looks good and her mama is doing her job…nothing I can really do for y'all since she's here now and lookin' healthy." The vet said to Miley and her dad. "Just gimme a call if anything starts lookin' wrong, you know how it goes."</P><P>"Alright, thank yah Todd, how much do we owe you?" Her dad asked the vet, and Miley motioned for me to follow her.</P><P>"Oh, no Robby, you don't owe me. I didn't do anything, just looked at her. You and Miley can do that any how, you two know enough about horses I don't even know why you call me out here anymore." I heard the vet telling Mr. Stewart as I jogged to catch up with Miley.</P><P>"Nothing interesting if going to happen now for awhile, since the filly is walking and looking healthy…now those two hill billies are just gonna stand 'round argueing about if Dr. Todd needs to get paid for coming out here or not. He'll end up stayin' for dinner, you just watch. Daddy has known him since before I was born. And plus Dr. Todd can't pass up my mama's homemade pies."</P><P>I smiled, enjoying being around Miley again and it not being awkward like it was awkward. It's so calming when it's just me and her for some reason; I'm really starting to enjoy it. I followed her on the way to what I think was the way to the tack room.</P><P>"We're just gonna grab some saddles and stuff from the tack room so we can saddle up Blue and Girl, then we can go on a ride." She told me pulling the tack room door open, and started pulling stuff off the hooks hanging up that I didn't even know what it was or where it went. "Hold this; it's for 'Girl."</P><P>"Okay," I said uncertainly, trying not to drop anything she just handed me, but then as soon as she got the last thing down off the wall she took it from me.</P><P>"I'll carry it, it's kinda heavy." She grinned at me as she pushed the door open for me, holding it open, "After you you." She nodded for me to go.</P><P>"Thanks." I shuffled quickly out of her way.</P><P>"Blue probably is already saddled; Travis might have had him out earlier." She told me, "Why don't you go get him, he won't give you any trouble…just don't act nervous. I'll get 'Girl ready for you."</P><P>"Alright," I nodded at her, walking away uncertainly trying to remember where Bluejeans' stall was…it turned out to be on the other side, and it was already occupied by somebody. "Uhh, hey." I said. "Uh, Miley wanted me to get Bluejeans for her."</P><P>He stood up, "Oh hey…you must be Lilly." He smiled, and stuck his hand out for me to shake. "I'm Travis; Miley told me about you…you're here for a month or something right?"</P><P>"Um, yup. That's me…Lilly." I shook his hand, it was so rough…everybody's hands were rough out here; even Miley's now that I think about it.</P><P>"So…she wants Bluejeans? Are you two going on a ride?" He asked as he grabbed the reins to Bluejeans. "I'll walk him over there…you look a little nervous, he might not like that."</P><P>"What's with horses and them not liking nervous people!" I said frustrated, "Miley said the same thing!"</P><P>He laughed, "They just know when you're nervous and it makes them nervous…they react to your mood. Just lighten up a bit, you shouldn't be nervous just 'cause they're bigger."</P><P>"That's not why I'm nervous…" I muttered.</P><P>"Oh yeah?" He looked curious, "Why're you nervous then?"</P><P>I rolled my eyes, I hadn't meant for him to actually hear that. "I dunno."</P><P>"You do know….is it 'cause of Miley?" He asked.</P><P>"Huh?"</P><P>"She's pretty intimidating at first, I know…believe me. We've had some times together where I was even nervous around her…and I've known her since we were kids!" He laughed again.</P><P>"Oh," I said.</P><P>"You don't talk much do you?"</P><P>"I do if you catch me in the right mood." I said, then was worried if I sounded bitchy or not…</P><P>"So you just don't talk when you're nervous," He grinned down at me, "I get that. It's cool." We walked up in front of "Girl's" stall. "Hey Miley, I've got a nervous Nellie here for you with a funny accent and a pair of Bluejeans."</P><P>She looked up and laughed when she saw me standing there looking slightly irritated with this good natured boy named Travis. "Nervous Nellie, huh? I told her not to be nervous around Blue, he wouldn't hurt a flea…unless it was a nervous flea, then he might think about it…"</P><P>Travis laughed with her, while I scowled by myself. Actually I think Bluejeans was scowling at them too, and that made me smile…almost.</P><P>"You guys are the ones with the funny accents." I said to Miley once we started off on the trail.</P><P>She laughed, "Really? I dunno, you've got a funny little accent yourself…where's it from? No where 'round here I can tell."</P><P>"California," I told her, sitting uncertainly upon the saddle…still not sure of this whole riding a horse thing.</P><P>"A city girl? Well no wonder you're nervous around horses then!" She laughed, "And don't worry about Girl there though, I think she's a little dumb…she doesn't pick up on nervous vibes…or any kind of vibes for that matter, she just likes to follow and look pretty."</P><P>"Well that's great to know, I'm riding a dummy." I said pretending to sound relieved.</P><P>Miley smiled, "Well you're a Nervous Nellie according to Travis…I think he likes you by the way, it looked like her had his flirtin' face on."</P><P>"Ew." I said quietly.</P><P>"Boys around here aren't good enough?" She laughed.</P><P>"Boys anywhere aren't good enough…" I said nervously.</P><P>"Oh yeah?"</P><P>"Yeah."</P><P>"Well," She turned to look at me, "That could be good to know." She winked.</P><P>"W-what do you mean?" I spluttered.</P><P>"You'll see…maybe." She added after pausing for a moment. "C'mon, you've got to see the falls. They're real nice." She said, then made a clicking noise to get Bluejeans to go faster. "C'mon Girl!" She called, to the horse or to me I'm not sure…but either way, Girl the horse went faster to follow behind Bluejeans, and we rode on in silence.</P><P>"This is the falls." She said, after she stopped Bluejeans and Girl, she tied their reins loosely to a post in the ground so they could graze while we were here. "Wanna swim?"</P><P>"I, uh, didn't bring anything to swim in, I didn't know." I said uncertainly.</P><P>"Oh, it's fine. I didn't either." She pulled her t-shirt over her head to reveal a blue bra, and she shimmied out of her pants while she kicked her boots off to the side. "C'mon!" She called as she ran to the water in her underwear and bra. "Nobody out here but you and me…so only I'm gonna see." She raised her eyebrows at me suggestively.</P><P>"Uh…" I glanced around uncertainly.</P><P>"And I've already seen EVERYTHING earlier…so it's not like I haven't already seen it." She taunted me.</P><P>I glared at her as I pulled my shirt off and pants throwing them into a pile with my socks and shoes. "I'm gonna get you!" I chased her to the water, where she grabbed a rope hanging from the tree and swung off it into the water.</P><P>"You'll have to catch me first." She said from the water once she surfaced.</P><P>I looked uncertainly at the water again.</P><P>"You're such a city girl," She laughed, "It's not gonna hurt you, maybe the fishies will nibble your toes…but I don't think they like Nervous Nellie's either."</P><P>I ran and did a cannon ball into the water, hoping I splashed her. But when I reached the surface of the water again I didn't see her, "Miley?" I called out uncertainly, "Wher-" I got cut off as something pulled me under down in to the water. I kicked once, twice and then got back to the top…to find Miley laughing hysterically at me. "Yeah real funny Miley."</P><P>"Maybe the fish do like Nervous Nellie's?" She laughed some more.</P><P>I swam towards to edge of the river like I was going to get out.</P><P>"I know I like Nervous Nellie's though…" She said quietly.</P><P>I turned, looking at her with one of my eyebrows raised. "Oh yeah?"</P><P>"Yeah."</P><P>"I dunno…girl's with accents aren't really my thing." I said pretending I wasn't interested…yeah, like I wasn't checking her out the second she ripped her clothes off and wasn't staring at her cute little butt the whole way into the water.</P><P>"What about girls that like horses and don't really have a life because they spend so much time working for their parents?" She questioned.</P><P>"Those girls….those girls are hott." I tried to hold back a laugh, but felt it escape anyways.</P><P>She laughed too, swimming closer to me, and I swam closer to her. "Well, I think there might be one of those here." She said quietly, "But she also has an accent."</P><P>"I can deal with the accent," I smiled and felt my stomach do a little flip when her hand brushed against mine in the water.</P><P>She moved her face closer to mine, and we closed the gap between us…almost, until… "What was that? Was that you?"</P><P>"Was what me?" I pulled back from her.</P><P>"Something touched my foot…was it you?"</P><P>"Um, n-no...it wasn't."</P><P>"Ahh! Swim Lilly swim for your life, the fishies are attacking!" She said jokingly, but still swam for the shore as fast as she could.</P><P>I followed behind her, slowly, I was almost a failure at swimming. "Wait, I don't want to get eaten." I pouted.</P><P>Once on shore she was her same cocky self, "Eaten by what?" She said suggestively.</P><P>"Uh." I felt my jaw drop, looking at her in her wet underclothes and her talking like a raunchy little boy I didn't know whether to be turned on or laugh.</P><P>She laughed, and pulled me the rest of the way out of the water. "So…where were we?"</P>
