<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 7 -->

<p>The morning was sunny and warm with only the slightest of breezes. B'Elanna was unaccustomed to spending time indoors and so when she finished her early breakfast she left the inn and headed to the harbour at a brisk walk.  She was fascinated by the ships and their cargoes.  She sat on a crate beside the wharf and watched the crewmen loading and unloading while she drank in the salty tang of the sea air.  She got up after a while and walked for several miles along the seaside, listening to the cry of the seabirds and enjoying the feel of the sun on her face.  When she was out of sight of the town she stripped her tunic off and spent some time lifting the heaviest rocks she could find along the shoreline, careful to not further injure her arm, but anxious to rebuild her strength as soon as possible.  Finally, satisfied she had done all she could, she returned to the inn.</p>
<p>The rest of her travelling companions were only walking up when she returned, so she went to her room to wash up while they broke their morning fast.  Annika's mother was still feeling a little shaky after yesterday's ordeal and she retired to her room to rest for the day as soon as the meal was done.  Lord Hansart lingered behind, drawing the young knight he had come to admire into a conversation.  He began by speaking of travel plans for the group the next day, but soon he was subtly probing for information about the young Lord's family and background.  Harry and B'Elanna had discussed this at length and so she had no trouble answering his questions.  She was bluntly honest in answer to his questions regarding her title and holdings.  After finding out the truth about the young man's landless status Lord Hansart made polite conversation for several more minutes before excusing himself to go and see to his wife.</p>
<p>As he walked up the stairs to his room he reflected on the answers he had received to his questions.  He was disappointed that the young Lord was without land or connections.  A title he had, he was looking for someone who had power and land to marry his daughter off to.  'Ah well, business is business I suppose,' he thought to himself.  Still he liked and admired the boy. 'After all Lord Beyla will be looking for a wife with family connections and land holdings as well.  With the right wife the lad will go far in this world,' he ruminated.  When he informed his wife that Lord Beyla was an unsuitable match for Annika she was disappointed as well, but she knew, as did her husband, that if they followed the tournament circuit for long enough they would find the perfect match for their daughter.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, unaware that her fate had been decided for her, went in search of Annika and the others to see if they wished to spend the day exploring the town and marketplace with her. Harry, Tom, Katherine, Annika and B'Elanna left the inn and strolled as a group toward the marketplace. Annika was happily holding onto B'Elanna's arm, and Katherine walked along beside them. Katherine, or Kate as she was called by all save her employers, was a young Irish lass whose parents had sold her into indentured servitude three years ago. In seven more years she would be free to pursue a life of her own. Although the institution of slavery was repugnant to her she had come to love the Hansarts and Annika in particular, whom she tended to think of as a younger sister. She was older than the young Lady, but Annika's status and beauty always left Kate feeling shy and awkward around her friend in public. She was feeling that way now and B'Elanna, recognizing her discomfort, went out of her way to engage the handmaiden in conversation. Annika, who disapproved of the notion of indentured servitude, was grateful to see the young Lord treating the Irish lass as an equal. Kate gradually grew comfortable with the couple and began to enjoy her day.</p>
<p>Tom and Harry were several paces in front of them and they were obviously enjoying one another's company. B'Elanna hadn't seen Harry acting as young and happy since he received word of his father's death. She smiled happily to herself at the sight of her friend engaging in such carefree horseplay with his new friend.</p>
<p>When the group reached the marketplace they strolled idly exploring whatever treasures were offered on the many tables that lined the market square. Because Dover was a seaport there were numerous exotic spices, foods and materials on display. Not even Annika or Harry had ever seen such things before. B'Elanna observed Annika examine a beautiful gold ring beset with jewels; she tried it on and admired it on her finger. B'Elanna waited until she put the ring down and moved away, before she made an excuse to slip away for a moment. She returned to the gold merchant and haggled for the ring, and placing it in a small pocket inside her tunic, she returned to Annika's side.</p>
<p>There were several food merchants cooking over open flames and they purchased several different types of meat and took them a small grassy garden just off the marketplace. B'Elanna and Harry spread their cloaks on the ground and they all sat down, talking and eating while sharing a flagon of wine that B'Elanna had purchased for the purpose. As the afternoon wore on they found they had formed a real friendship with one another despite their differences in age and status.</p>
<p>As the merchants began to pack up their wares the group purchased some fruit and wine to take back to Annika's parents. They overheard a conversation between two of the sellers about a dance troupe that was performing in the square this evening and Tom offered to return to the inn to inform Annika's father that they would be staying in town for several more hours to watch the spectacle. Harry decided to take pity on his friend and offered his arm to Kate as they strolled around the square, watching the preparations for the dancing.</p>
<p>Left alone for the first time that day B'Elanna took the opportunity to give her gift to Annika. She was surprised at the nervous clenching of her stomach as she drew the ring out of the pocket of her tunic. She had faced down knights twice her size in the lists and never had she felt so exposed and nervous as she did right now. She took Annika's hand, and kissing it, she turned it over, kissing the palm before she laid her gift in the beautiful woman's hand. The sharp intake of breathe was indication enough of Annika's delight with the present.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla, but how did you know?"</p>
<p>"I observed you admiring it when we were in the marketplace; it seemed as if you truly wanted it."</p>
<p>"I did, but you didn't have to do this my Lord." Never in her life had someone done something like that for Annika. If she wanted something she usually had only to ask for it, but to have someone anticipate her want and give her such a gift without even being asked was amazing to her. Lord Beyla made her feel as if she were the most precious thing in his world. It touched her soul to be so admired. She was at a loss for words but felt she needed to say something. "It is beautiful."</p>
<p>"As are you Lady Hansart, as are you."</p>
<p>The dancing was about to begin and the square was lit entirely by torchlight. The young friends found a spot to stand and take in the performance. The Morris dancers were extremely talented and the music was light and lilting. B'Elanna once again enjoyed the feeling of Annika's body pressed closely beside her own, and she smiled to herself as she noticed the young woman often admiring the ring she now wore on her finger. Unable to see over the head of the man who moved in front of her when the crowd stirred Annika shifted until she was standing in front of B'Elanna, as the crowd continued to move she felt herself gradually pressed back against the young Lord. She stiffened at first, but then relaxed when she realized that Beyla did not object to the physical contact. Slowly she leaned her body back into the solid form of Lord Beyla, feeling the heat radiating from his body. She felt his hands come to rest lightly on her hips and she experienced a wave of heat that washed over her body and left her weak and breathless, she leaned even harder against her Lord, feeling Beyla's breath in her ear as they continued to watch the dancers with their eyes while the rest of their bodies were only aware of the contact between them. Despite the fact that they were standing still B'Elanna felt her heart beating as rapidly as it did when she was doing her exercises. She could feel herself falling in love with the young woman, and she had no idea what to do about it. When the dancing was over they reluctantly moved apart, but as they walked back to the inn Annika held tightly to Lord Beyla's arm and they never let go of one another until they parted at Annika's door.</p>
<p>They left very early the next day, and B'Elanna had barely time to nod good morning to Annika before they were climbing into the carriage. The Hansart family was riding inside the carriage while B'Elanna, Harry and Tom were on horseback outside. Since their skirmish with the highwayman had ended in his death there was little worry about being set upon while they traveled, but nonetheless B'Elanna kept a close eye on her surroundings as they rode. Because of the early hour of their departure everyone was a little tired and so it was not until after the noon meal that Lord Hansart noticed the ring that Annika was wearing on her finger. He leaned forward and grasped Annika's hand, pulling it toward himself, his brow furrowed deeply as he examined her hand.</p>
<p>"Where did you get this Annika?"</p>
<p>"At the marketplace yesterday. Lord Beyla gave it to me after he noticed me admiring it."</p>
<p>"Take it off," he barked. He couldn't believe he daughter would do such a thing.</p>
<p>"Why father, it was a gift," cried Annika pulling her hand away from her father and cradling it protectively out of his sight.</p>
<p>"You know better than to accept a gift from a young man Annika. This is entirely inappropriate. What will your husband think if finds out you accepted a ring from another man."</p>
<p>"I have no husband as yet, and therefore no one to disapprove of this gift." She paused for a moment and then asked the question that had been in her mind for several days now. "Why do you not enter into negotiations with Lord Beyla for my hand."</p>
<p>"Because he is unsuitable as a husband for you Annika; he has no land and no connections. You know we are counting on your marriage to provide those things for this family."</p>
<p>"But father, I believe I love Lord Beyla, and."</p>
<p>"Love! You are a silly girl Annika. Love and marriage have nothing to do with one another. This is to be a business arrangement, only the poor can afford to marry for love. Your affection for one another will grow from your mutual life together after you are joined."</p>
<p>"You break my heart father."</p>
<p>"Enough! This discussion is over. A broken heart is like a skinned knee, it will heal in time. It is time for you to put aside your childish notions and grow up Annika; you are not a little girl any longer. Your family requires that your marriage be a good one, we are counting on you Annika. You will do your duty to me and to your family. Do you understand me?"</p>
<p>Annika was too grief stricken to speak, but she understood that her father was right, and so ignoring the tears that were stinging her eyes she nodded mutely and removed the beautiful ring from her finger.</p>
<p>That evening when they reached Coventry they again made arrangements to stay at the same inn before continuing on together in the morning for London. B'Elanna noticed that Annika was looking pale and drawn and so after dinner she invited the young woman out for a walk around the town square. Annika did not wish to have the conversation she knew she must initiate with the handsome young lord and so she hesitated a moment before accepting the invitation. B'Elanna saw the look of hesitation and discomfort and a felt a coldness grip her heart. She gave the young woman her arm and together they left the inn, walking in silence to the square. The square was lovely, filled with trees and flowers and lined with benches. Annika walked to one of the benches and sat down, facing Beyla so that she might do her duty toward her family. Oh how she wished she did not have to do this.seeing the look of tender concern on Beyla's face only made her task that much harder. She pulled the ring out of her waistband and held it out to Beyla.</p>
<p>"I don't understand Lady Annika. You do not like the ring."</p>
<p>"No, I love it, but I should not have accepted it from you and it would not be right for me to keep it. Please take it back."</p>
<p>Beyla closed Annika's fingers over the ring, rejecting it. "No Annika, I want you to have it."</p>
<p>"I cannot, my father has forbidden it. I am to be married to the first suitable man that my father finds and it would not be appropriate for me to have accepted this from you."</p>
<p>"Is this what you want Annika, to be married to a 'suitable' man?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter what I want. I must obey my father and do what is best for my family."</p>
<p>"And what about what is best for you Annika, because that is all that I care about."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Lord Beyla."</p>
<p>"Don't be sorry Annika. Perhaps there is a chance that your father will change his mind. Perhaps he might consider me suitable when I have won a few more tournaments." B'Elanna recognized that she was being absurd to thing that she could carry her deception to the point of taking a wife, but her feelings for the saddened young woman caused her to blurt out her feelings without thought.</p>
<p>"You have no land and no connection to the throne and that is all my father cares about."</p>
<p>"Annika, I care for you and want you to be happy, and I believe that you care for me too. You shouldn't have to marry a man you do not love simply because your father commands it. You should follow your heart. Keep the ring please, I beg you." As she spoke she unlaced a leather thong that tied the top of her tunic together. Taking the ring from Annika she slipped it onto the thong and then tied a knot in the two ends. She hung the necklace over Annika's head, gratified to see the beautiful woman hold the ring tightly for a second before tucking it inside of her dress.</p>
<p>Annika felt the ring fall into the top of her corset and nestle between her breasts. The warmth of the metal next to her heart filled her with such peace that she could not believe she was doing something wrong.</p>
<p>B'Elanna kissed her hand saying, "keep me close to your heart Lady Annika."</p>
<p>"Always."</p>
