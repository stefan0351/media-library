<!-- Live A Little \ Part 3 -->

<p>"Remind me why I'm here again?"</p>

<p>"Don't try and act all innocent! You want to see Brooke in her cheerleading uniform just as much as I do!"</p>

<p>"Whatever."</p>

<p>"I don't understand why you insist on lying to me! Hello! I'm you!"</p>

<p>"Look, I'm not a host for your ghost, okay?!"</p>

<p>"Ha. Ha. Very funny."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"I hope I wasn't this annoying when I was alive."</p>

<p>"You're this annoying even when you're dead!"</p>

<p>Nicole stops her stretching exercises and stares strangely at Sam.</p>

<p>"B? I think Spam's spaz gene finally kicked in for good this time."</p>

<p>They watch on in silence as Sam talks animatedly to herself. </p>

<p>"She's being doing this for a while now."</p>

<p>"I vote we get her institutionalized as soon as possible and throw away the key."</p>

<p>Brooke glares at Nic. "Great help, thankyou." She walks over to Sam.</p>

<p>"Sam? What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Perving, honey" Alt Sam replies with a leer, then turns to her double. "Doesn't she have great legs?" Sam shoots her a glare while Brooke watches on in confusion, waiting for Sam's answer.</p>

<p>"Nothing, just hanging around."</p>

<p>"You never watch me while I practice."</p>

<p>"First time for everything, right?"</p>

<p>"I guess."</p>

<p>"If my being here makes you uncomfortable, I can go."</p>

<p>"No, damn it!" Alt Sam cries out. "I wanna watch!"</p>

<p>Sam turns toward her with a glare. "Don't yell! I've got a headache already because of you!"</p>

<p>"We're not leaving!" Alt Sam replies stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Fine, just shut it!"</p>

<p>Brooke rubs her fingers with her temples then shakes her head. She places her hand on Sam's forehead, checking for a fever. "Sam, I'm really worried about you. I think I should take you to a doctor. Do you have a head injury or something?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine Brooke. It's just a little...complicated."</p>

<p>Nicole walks over. "Still talking to yourself, huh Spam? Even I didn't realise you were that desperate for friends."</p>

<p>"Hit the bitch Sam!" Alt Sam hisses with a scowl.</p>

<p>"Nicole, enough. Go, please" Brooke interrupts before Sam can respond.</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"Go. Now."</p>

<p>"That's my girl." Alt Sam grins proudly, sticking out her tongue at Nicole's retreating back.</p>

<p>Brooke turns towards Sam. "You sure you're okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Brooke, thanks."</p>

<p>Alt Sam suddenly stands up and throws her arms around Brooke. Sam can't help feeling touched at the scene and smiles gently. "I guess I'll see you at home."</p>

<p>Brooke offers a reluctant nod before she walks away. Alt Sam sits beside her sadly. "She didn't feel me. She didn't feel a thing." </p>

<p>"I'm sure she did" Sam offers sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No, she didn't." Alt Sam stands up, clearly upset. "Can we go?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Dumping her school bag on the floor, Sam sprawls on the couch while alt Sam sits on the arm rest impatiently. "When is she coming home?"</p>

<p>"Soon. Normally we eat together at breakfast but sometimes Mum goes in to work early."</p>

<p>"I can't wait to see her again. I miss her."</p>

<p>"I know. Can I ask you something?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"When you...died, did you see dad?"</p>

<p>"Sam, in my timeline, Dad never died. They got divorced."</p>

<p>"He's alive? Why did they get divorced?"</p>

<p>"They weren't in love anymore. Simple as that."</p>

<p>"Wow. What other differences can you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Let's see. Lily isn't a vegetarian and she couldn't give a rats ass about any animal or environmental issues. She doesn't even recycle, the bitch!"</p>

<p>"You're kidding me!"</p>

<p>"Nope! What else...oh yeah, Josh is gay."</p>

<p>"The musical?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"So, if that is when he figured it out, does that mean Brooke and he didn't...you know?"</p>

<p>"She didn't lose her virginity to Josh, no."</p>

<p>"Who, then? Harrison?"</p>

<p>"No. Me."</p>

<p>"WHAAAAT?!" </p>

<p>"It happened one night."</p>

<p>"That's it? That's all you can say?"</p>

<p>"We were drunk and being silly and it just happened."</p>

<p>"And you didn't tell her how you felt?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?!"</p>

<p>"We were both stubborn and stupid and scared. We pretended it never happened."</p>

<p>"Jesus!"</p>

<p>"He's a nice guy."</p>

<p>"Would you stop that!"</p>

<p>"And you shouldn't use his name in vain. He doesn't like it."</p>

<p>"How can you...I can't believe this! You slept with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just that one night."</p>

<p>"How can you be so stupid?"</p>

<p>"I don't regret it. I mean, it wasn't exactly the most romantic of circumstances, but I don't care. It was the best night of my life."</p>

<p>"That's not what I mean! How could you not say anything to her?"</p>

<p>"For the very same reason you won't Sam."</p>

<p>"She slept with you! You don't just sleep with anybody!"</p>

<p>"Some people do."</p>

<p>"I'm talking about me! You! You and Brooke! We don't go around just fucking anyone we come across, no matter how drunk we are! There has to be some sort of emotional attachment. You know this! What did you need? A big fucking neon sign telling you that she loved you?"</p>

<p>"When you're scared, you can miss the obvious. Besides, don't get all high and mighty with me. I went for it and yes, it didn't work out the way I wanted, but at least I tried. Can you say the same thing Sam?"</p>

<p>"Don't preach to me!"</p>

<p>"And don't judge me! I screwed up, I know this, and it cost me my life. I think about this every fucking second, of every fucking day, and I don't need you shoving it down my throat, okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. This is just so wrong!"</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be here! You shouldn't be dead! You're sixteen, you should be alive and with Brooke and...it's just so wrong."</p>

<p>"Shit happens."</p>

<p>"That doesn't help, you know."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"What happened to Nicole? Is she in jail?"</p>

<p>"Hospital actually, under watch. She's attempted suicide three times."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Believe me, she feels bad about what she did."</p>

<p>"So she should!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I'm thinking once I'm done with you, I might see if I'm allowed to pay her a visit. Tell her, that it's okay."</p>

<p>"She took your life, your future! She doesn't deserve forgiveness!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not, but she's genuinely sorry for what she did. No one else needs to die over this mess and I'm not going to spend eternity in anger."</p>

<p>"Why not visit Brooke instead?"</p>

<p>"Brooke needs to accept my death. If I visit her, she's won't be able to do that. We'll be together again, one day."</p>

<p>"Does death do that to you?"</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Make you wise?"</p>

<p>Alt Sam shrugs casually. "You get a new perspective on things." They both look up as Jane walks through the door. Alt Sam immediately begins to cry as she wraps her arms around Jane's waist. Sam stands up and stares at them momentarily before she too, envelopes Jane in a big hug.</p>

<p>"Not that I'm complaining Sam, but what's this for?" Jane asks puzzled, but obviously pleased with Sam's unexpected greeting.</p>

<p>Sam smiles. "Just because."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Sam wakes up and looks around to find Alt Sam has disappeared. Wondering where she could have possibly gotten to, she smiles and heads straight into Brooke's bedroom, to find Alt Sam sitting on the bed, watching Brooke sleep.</p>

<p>"Hey."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to wake you."</p>

<p>"You didn't. It's 4 in the morning."</p>

<p>"Ghosts don't need sleep."</p>

<p>"I guess not. How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"A while. I don't know."</p>

<p>"Can I ask you something?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to sound insensitive or anything, but why can't you do this with your own Brooke?"</p>

<p>"She's not the only one who needs to accept my death."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"I watch over the people I care about, but not like this. Not so personally."</p>

<p>"If you did, you'd never leave."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"You're saying goodbye to her. You're leaving me aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm needed elsewhere and besides, I'm getting too attached. It's easier to look over a Sam who isn't so much like me."</p>

<p>"Like the guy Sam or the Sam from Australia?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Does the aussie Sam say G'day mate?"</p>

<p>"No, she doesn't and she doesn't say "Crikey!" and they don't have kangaroos as pets, okay?"</p>

<p>"Just asking!"</p>

<p>"You are the most frustrating Sam I've ever met!"</p>

<p>"What can I say, it's a gift."</p>

<p>"Haven't I taught you anything while I've been haunting you?"</p>

<p>"More than you know."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that something has penetrated that thick head of yours."</p>

<p>"It has."</p>

<p>"Good." </p>

<p>"I must admit, if I'm anything like you, I'm a pretty cool person."</p>

<p>"And don't let anyone say anything different! We McPhersons rock!"</p>

<p>"Damn straight! Well...sort of."</p>

<p>They share a laugh. Alt Sam places a gentle kiss on Brooke's lips before she turns towards Sam and hugs her tightly.</p>

<p>"Good luck Sam. With everything."</p>

<p>"Aren't you disappointed?"</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"That I won't tell her."</p>

<p>"You will. When you're ready."</p>

<p>"How can you be so sure?"</p>

<p>"Because you don't want to end up like me."</p>

<p>"What? Dead?"</p>

<p>"No, brainfreeze! You don't want to live a life of "what ifs."</p>

<p>"And if she doesn't love me back?"</p>

<p>"You move on and find someone who will. We McPhersons are pretty easy to love."</p>

<p>"Simple as that, huh?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't, but it shouldn't stop you from trying."</p>

<p>"Okay. I'll think about it."</p>

<p>"That's all I ask. Besides, she might tell you first."</p>

<p>"I'll keep dreaming."</p>

<p>Alt Sam places a kiss on her cheek before she fades away.</p>

<p>"You do that, and don't ever let go." </p>
