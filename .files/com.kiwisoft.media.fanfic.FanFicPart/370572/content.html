<p>It was three o'clock when Miley and Lilly tiptoed out of the emergency tent which had been hastily erected for the former occupants of the now uninhabitable Cabin 13.</p>
<p>"Two hours sleep!" moaned Lilly as they made their way to the dock. The girls had been up until one digging in the rubble for their belongings and setting up the emergency tent to shelter themselves for the night. "Why can't we escape when we've had some rest?"</p>
<p>"There'll never be a better time than this," Miley insisted. "The clones are all so exhausted that they wouldn't wake up if we fired a cannon in the compound." Her eyes scanned the boats bobbing at the dock. "Here's a nice little sailboat. And there's a fairly good breeze." She nodded, satisfied. "We should be on the mainland in no time."</p>
<p>"It's too dark," mumbled Lilly, struggling into her life jacket.</p>
<p>"It's only dark," said Miley, "because you haven't opened your eyes yet. Snap out of it. It's going to take two of us to get this thing across the water." She buckled herself into her own life jacket.</p>
<p>"I'm tired."</p>
<p>"Life jackets on correctly?" snapped Miley crisply. "Yup. Emergency oars?...Yup. Bailing bucket?...Hey, we've even got a bailing bucket. How about that?"</p>
<p>"Extra gas can. You forgot extra gas can."</p>
<p>"No, thank you, ma'am," said Miley. "This is a sailboat. And may I remind you that there will be no sleeping on board by passengers or crew. We will be leaving port in five seconds. Since you still have one foot on the dock, I recommend that you make up your mind."</p>
<p>Lilly jumped aboard and looked oddly at her companion. It was remarkable how even the thought of leaving Algonkian Island managed to animate Miley's personality.</p>
<p>Miley ran up the sail and slowly the boat began to creep away from the dock.</p>
<p>"Ahoy, there, Truscott. Look alive or I'll have you swabbing the deck."</p>
<p>"Do you have to do that?" grumbled Lilly.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have to do that," explained Miley. "You're falling asleep. Take a new port-starboard heading! Man the poop deck! Trim the mains'l! Avast, ye swab!"</p>
<p>"I can't go to port and starboard at the same time," growled Lilly. "We have no poop deck. And that's not just the mainsail—it's our only sail!"</p>
<p>"You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you?" said Miley with mock dejection. "We're moving along really well, I think." She shaded her eyes in her best seafaring manner. "Thar she blows!"</p>
<p>"There what blows?" asked Lilly, annoyed. She sat up suddenly, eyes wide, and pointed to the limp sail. "Nothing blows! Nothing! Miley, we've lost the wind. What are we going to do? We're only a third of the way across."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," said Miley confidently. "We've got a long time until reveille. After last night the clones won't want the prisoners up until eight or nine. The current will take us the rest of the way by then."</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Lilly anxiously. "Maybe we should start rowing."</p>
<p>"Go right ahead," invited Miley. "I'm going to sit back, relax, and let the current do the work."</p>
<p>"Well, I guess you're right," Lilly conceded. "For a little while, anyway, until we see how things go."</p>
<p>The two girls reclined in the becalmed sailboat. Tiny waves lapped against the hull and the small craft drifted aimlessly. Soon Miley and Lilly were fast asleep.</p>
<p>A sudden jar and an odd scraping sound brought Lilly Truscott to awareness. She glanced down in surprise at her companion, who was using Lilly's leg as a pillow. The bump seemed to rouse her slightly, because she sighed in her sleep and nuzzled—<i>nuzzled</i>—Lilly's leg. Lilly smiled faintly before looking up to see what had caused the jerk, and her eyes widened. "Hey, we're here! We're here! Miley, wake up! We made it!"</p>
<p>Miley snapped to attention. It was still dark—a little past five according to the luminous face on his watch. The boat had beached itself on a sand bar not five feet from shore. "Land ho," she commented blandly. She didn't seem to realize or care that she had been sleeping on Lilly's leg. "Now, wasn't that better than rowing?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, perhaps a bit too enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Miley briskly, "time to set the boat adrift. Where's the note?"</p>
<p>"I thought you were bringing the note."</p>
<p>Miley sighed. "Must I do everything? Oh well, we'll just set it adrift without a note. They'll figure it out."</p>
<p>The two scrambled out of the sailboat, pushed it out towards the open water and waded ashore.</p>
<p>"Where to?" asked Lilly.</p>
<p>"Just walk," said Miley, "directly away from the lake." She reached into her pocket and produced a shiny quarter. "You see this quarter? When we reach a pay phone, this is our ticket home. I've been saving it since the day I arrived at Alcatraz."</p>
<p>They trudged in silence for a while.</p>
<p>"You know," said Lilly suddenly, "I don't think my folks are going to be too pleased with the fact that I ran away from camp."</p>
<p>"Oh, mine won't either," said Miley, "and Guidance will be most distressed. But after a while they'll get used to the idea. They always do." Her eyes gleamed in the darkness. "The only thing I regret about leaving camp is that I won't get to witness Ashley's punishment for starting the riot."</p>
<p>"Yeah," agreed Lilly, grinning. "Trina is so mad she's likely to put her on work detail for years. Serves her right too, the twit!"</p>
<p>Miley wrinkled her nose. "We're getting close to civilization. I smell garbage." She tossed her quarter up in the air and caught it deftly. "Where there's garbage, there's people, and where there's people, there's a telephone." She was almost smiling.</p>
<p>"Sun's coming up," commented Lilly.</p>
<p>Miley consulted her watch. "Ten to six," she announced. "Look, there's a clearing up ahead. Civilization. People. Telephones."</p>
<p>Both girls broke into a run. They came out of the trees into the clearing and stopped dead, mouths agape. There was the wash station. And the baseball diamond. And the mess hall. And Cabins 1 through 22, including the damaged 13.</p>
<p>"This," said Miley quietly, "is obviously not civilization."</p>
<p>Lilly stepped forward and spread her arms wide. "But how?"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> were steering," Miley pointed out.</p>
<p>"You fell asleep too!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but <i>I</i> wasn't steering."</p>
<p>Lilly sat down on the grass. "I don't want to be back here," she said simply. "I want to go home. Let's get another boat."</p>
<p>"Too late," said Miley, eyeing the sunrise. "The clones would catch us right in the middle of the lake. But tomorrow's another day." She grimaced. "It's a good thing we didn't put a note in that boat explaining how we'd run off. We'd look awfully stupid. And we'd also haul garbage even longer than Ashley."</p>
<p>Lilly hung her head and scratched at the turf. "I'm sorry," she said. "It's all my fault. If I hadn't fallen asleep we'd be on our way home by now."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "I accept your apology."</p>
<p>Lilly stared at her. "You mean you're not going to shoulder one bit of the blame?"</p>
<p>"Why should I?" asked Miley. "I wasn't steering."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed in spite of herself. Miley was, after all, Miley, and that was that.</p>
<p>Walking over to Cabin 13 Miley wriggled gingerly through the hole in the side wall and stepped gracefully through the ankle-deep feathers to what had been her corner. From her pocket she produced the chalk and drew a fourth line beside the other three on the wall.</p>
<p>"Four," she counted wearily.</p>
<p>"Well, you guys," said Trina at the breakfast table, "there'll be no activities for you today."</p>
<p>"Drat the luck," said Miley, poker-faced. "I was planning on a little baseball, soccer, swimming, volleyball, badminton, obstacle course, field hockey and darts. And then, <i>after</i> lunch—"</p>
<p>"Stewart, cut that out!" bellowed Trina. "We've got a cabin to fix up! If you guys are going to act like animals you're going to have to miss some of the fun!"</p>
<p>"May I remind you," said Miley quietly, "that it was not one of us who kicked in the wall."</p>
<p>"Shut up!" mumbled Trina.</p>
<p>"Yeah, shut up!" snarled Ashley. "I bet it was your fault last night!"</p>
<p>"You'd have a hard time proving that," said Miley, "considering you're the one who jumped on Sarah."</p>
<p>"The bed was broken!"</p>
<p>"Of course it was broken. You kept on hurling yourself onto it. What did you expect?"</p>
<p>"You are nothing but a nut!" screamed Ashley.</p>
<p>"And you're a twit!" shouted Lilly defensively.</p>
<p>"Now let's not lose our tempers," said Miley quietly.</p>
<p>"You guys are both crazy! We haven't got one nut! We've got two!"</p>
<p>"Two nuts and a twit!" Lilly counted, red-faced.</p>
<p>"And no cabin," Miley added.</p>
<p>"Cool it, you guys!" yelled Trina.</p>
<p>"Stay out of this!" chorused Lilly and Ashley furiously.</p>
<p>Angrily Trina doubled her fist and hit the table with a mighty crash. A leg snapped, the table tilted, and an assortment of trays and dishes slid off onto the floor.</p>
<p>There was a shocked silence, broken by Miley's dry voice: "I can just see the headline: <i>Table Destroyed At Alcatraz, toll of phantom wood-butcher rises to two</i>."</p>
<p>A piercing hoot escaped Lilly Truscott. She broke into gales of laughter.</p>
<p>Trina pointed in turn to Ashley, Lilly and Miley. "Work detail! Work detail! <i>Work detail!</i>"</p>
<p>They were interrupted by the appearance of Marina, the head counselor, in the doorway. "Attention, everybody. All campers and staff are to report to the baseball diamond after breakfast. Ms. Warden has something to say to us."</p>
<p>"And I've got something to say to her," commented Miley. "Her legs are crooked."</p>
<p>Lilly's laughter swelled again.</p>
<p>Trina pointed at her and then at Miley. "Work detail! Work detail!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," soothed Miley.</p>
<p>"Now, let's see," said Miley as she and Lilly settled themselves in among the crowd on the baseball diamond. "I got two days work detail and you got two days work detail, but little Ashley got only one. It looks as if twits have a higher standing than nuts around here."</p>
<p>Lilly was just getting herself back under control. "Oh, Miley, don't make me laugh! <i>Please</i> don't make me laugh when the Warden comes!"</p>
<p>All eyes were drawn to the camp director's cottage at the edge of the baseball field. The front door opened and Ms. Warden emerged, smartly dressed in a white tennis outfit. She strutted briskly to the small platform that Marina had set up for her, mounted it and reached for the microphone.</p>
<p>"Look," murmured Miley, "you can see half the camp through her legs."</p>
<p>Lilly held her head. Surviving this assembly without receiving more work detail wasn't going to be easy.</p>
<p>"Good morning, girls," said Ms. Warden sternly. It was obvious to all that the director was furious. "You all know why I've called you here this morning. I'm referring to the outrageous events of last night. I have no doubt that most of you were involved."</p>
<p>"Some more than others," said Miley, staring at Ashley.</p>
<p>"Miley—" whispered Lilly warningly. Trina was glaring in their direction.</p>
<p>"Now, girls," said the director, "this is Camp Algonkian Island. It was founded thirty-one years ago by my grandfather, Elias Warden, and in all that time, not once before last night has any wanton destruction occurred. Much damage was caused by your foolishness, damage that must be repaired at the camp's expense. Since you have proved that you cannot be trusted on your own, in future, patrols will be posted during counselors' meetings. Meanwhile, you will all take turns assisting the girls of Cabin 13 in repairing their unit. That takes priority over everything."</p>
<p>She paused to let her words sink in. "It would benefit campers, <i>and</i> counselors," she added, glaring at Trina, "if we all learned to practice a little self-control.</p>
<p>"And one more thing—a two-man sailboat is missing from the dock. There can be only two reasons for this, both of them unacceptable to me. Either the boat was improperly tied and drifted away, or someone has taken it without permission. Whoever is responsible had better own up soon.</p>
<p>"Your counselors will tell you what hours you will be working on Cabin 13. See that the events of last night are not repeated. Good day."</p>
<p>"Gee, she's crabby," remarked Miley.</p>
<p>Groups of campers spent the morning clearing out the wreckage of Cabin 13, salvaging bedding and whatever reusable lumber they could find. Shortly before noon two professional carpenters arrived by launch from the mainland.</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart!</i>" Trina shouted at one point, "You get in there and help!"</p>
<p>"I don't salvage," was Miley's reply.</p>
<p>"The heck you don't!"</p>
<p>So Miley bent her back the same as everyone else.</p>
<p>"Sentenced to one month hard labor," Miley recited, hauling a mattress out to air on the grass, "the Noble Nuts are forced to toil endlessly in the hot sun for the satisfaction of the dreaded clone taskmasters."</p>
<p>"This is definitely slave labor!" grunted Lilly, beating the dust out of a pillow.</p>
<p>"Come on, you guys!" shouted Trina. "Hurry it up! Keep moving!" She walked up to Miley. "Do you know anything about that missing sailboat, Stewart?"</p>
<p>"I don't sail," said Miley.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised to hear that," said Trina. "All right, you guys," she bellowed, "break for lunch! Wash station first!"</p>
<p>"I don't know about you," said Miley as she and Lilly entered the wash station, "but they've seen the last of me on that job site. My parents sent me to camp to have fun."</p>
<p>Lilly splashed water onto her sweaty face. "How are you going to get out of it?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to get poisoned from lunch and sleep it off in the infirmary," Miley decided. "With my radio. Miraculously, it survived the disaster."</p>
<p>"They found my guitar," said Lilly forlornly. "Smashed."</p>
<p>"Alcatraz will probably pay for the repairs," said Miley. "After all, it got smashed in <i>their</i> cabin which was destroyed by <i>their</i> campers. And the finishing touch was delivered by <i>their</i> clone. Hey," she went on, "I wonder if anyone's fixed our mess table. We may have to eat off the floor."</p>
<p>"That'll be okay for you," said Lilly. "It'll be easier to get poisoned off the floor. I'm going to have to work this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Why don't you get poisoned too?" suggested Miley. "I'm sure there's plenty of poison to go around."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head. "I'd better not. They'd get suspicious if there were two of us. You go ahead."</p>
<p>The girls arrived in the mess hall to find that table 13 had been replaced by a long sheet of plywood resting on two sawhorses. Because the sawhorses were of slightly different sizes, the new table had a pronounced slope.</p>
<p>Lilly put down her tray and watched helplessly as her orange rolled away towards the end of the table. It hit the edge of Trina's tray, bounced into the air and landed with a resounding <i>plop!</i> In the counselor's soup.</p>
<p>"Nice shot," commented Miley dryly. "You gave her a real snootful."</p>
<p>"Cut the comedy," snapped Trina, wiping the soup off her face. "All right, you guys, hurry up. We've got a job to do this afternoon."</p>
<p>"And don't eat anything round," advised Miley. She tasted her tomato soup. "Hey, this tastes spoiled!"</p>
<p>"It's not spoiled," said Trina.</p>
<p>"Well, you ought to know. You're covered in it." Miley finished her soup, making sour faces all the while. Then she turned to her hot dog and took a bite. "Ugh! Where do they store the meat? Out in the sun?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with those hot dogs, Stewart," said Trina warningly. "Eat."</p>
<p>Miley ate, and when the last bite was gone she doubled over on the bench and gasped, "You made me eat and now I'm sick!"</p>
<p>"She's not sick," sneered Ashley. "She's just trying to get out of working this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Shut up, Ashley!" snapped Trina. She turned to Miley. "You're not sick, Stewart! You're just trying to get out of work this afternoon!"</p>
<p>"I'm sick," said Miley. "And if I don't get to the infirmary soon I'm going to die at your hands, just like the cabin and the table."</p>
<p>"That does it!" growled Trina. "There was nothing wrong with the food and there's nothing wrong with you. Now sit up straight and save your strength. You're going to need it for this afternoon."</p>
<p>"If I die…" warned Miley.</p>
<p>"I'll take that chance!"</p>
<p>"We're lucky," commented Miley, heaving a huge garbage bag into her wheelbarrow. "We got off work so we could serve our work detail. Isn't camp fun?"</p>
<p>"Ugh! Spaghetti!" exclaimed Lilly, taping a torn bag. She laughed. "Did you notice that Trina sat at the high end of the table at supper? Good thing too."</p>
<p>"Yeah," agreed Miley. "After all, it was Her Cloneship who spilled the spaghetti that came oozing down at Ashley. That twit'll be picking spaghetti out of her lap for the duration."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed again. "Anyway, we'll have a roof over our heads tonight. The wall's back up and they're setting up the bunks now." She grasped the handles of the wheelbarrow and started down the path. "Are we going to give escaping another shot tomorrow?"</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "I'd like to, but it's not practical," she replied. "The clones are really watching the dock since that sailboat—ahem—disappeared. Let's give it another day and see what happens."</p>
<p>They approached the dump to find Ashley already there emptying her wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>"Well," said Miley. "Observe the typical Algonkian Twit in its natural habitat."</p>
<p>"Shut up, Stewart! It's your fault I got work detail! Everything is your fault!"</p>
<p>"I try," said Miley modestly.</p>
<p>"Oh, you make me so <i>mad!</i>" screamed Ashley.</p>
<p>"That's because you're so <i>nasty!</i>" shouted Lilly.</p>
<p>"You two leave me alone," warned Ashley, "or I'll tell Trina you attacked me."</p>
<p>"Liar!" shouted Lilly, outraged. "Twit!"</p>
<p>"Kindly move out of the way," said Miley to Ashley. "I'm dumping my garbage."</p>
<p>"Truscott, you're even worse than <i>her!</i> You're a real nut!"</p>
<p>"How'd you like to eat this garbage?" warned Lilly.</p>
<p>"<i>Nut!</i>" screamed Ashley in a white-hot rage. "<i>Nut!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Twit!</i>" Lilly screamed back. "Bonehead! Skunk!"</p>
<p>"<i>Awww!</i>" Blindly Ashley stormed out of the clearing in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Miley cupped her hand to her ear with something almost like a smile on her face.</p>
<p><i>Splash!</i></p>
<p>"She's in the creek!" crowed Lilly. "Ashley fell in the creek!"</p>
<p>"Help!" came a gurgling voice.</p>
<p>"Come on," said Miley wearily. "Let's go fish her out."</p>
<p>"I suppose we have to," said Lilly sadly.</p>
<p>Miley nodded.</p>
<p>Each hauling on an arm, Miley and Lilly pulled Ashley to her feet in the shallow water of the creek.</p>
<p>"I'll fix you!" she spluttered. "I'm going to tell Trina you threw me in!"</p>
<p>"Well, in that case…" said Miley. Her eyes met Lilly's. Both girls nodded. They dropped Ashley back in the water.</p>
<p>"And Ashley says they threw her in the creek, and Stewart says she fell in," finished Trina at the counselors' meeting later that night.</p>
<p>"Well," said Lauren, "it's obvious Stewart's lying."</p>
<p>"That's what I said to her," said Trina. "And do you know what her answer was? 'I don't lie.' And do you know what? I believe her. She may be everything else in the world, but a liar she isn't."</p>
<p>"Trina," began Marina, the head counselor. "we've been doing quite a bit of talking about your kid Stewart, and we've decided that she's a real problem."</p>
<p>"Well, hallelujah," said Trina, chin in hand. "Now tell me something I don't know." She looked up suddenly, eyes anxious. "That sounded like Stewart! I'm starting to sound like Stewart!"</p>
<p>"Just take it easy," soothed Marina. "Don't let the kid get to you. Tomorrow all your problems will be solved."</p>
<p>"How?" asked Trina. "Are you going to drown Stewart? Would you do Ashley too? And maybe Truscott?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow," said Marina determinedly, "we're all going to make your Stewart take part in our sports program—and we've got an extensive one planned."</p>
<p>Trina was not impressed. "<i>You</i> tell her," she said.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," promised Marina. "We'll tell her."</p>
<p>The beaver was still trembling. The sound and smell of humans was often in the woods, but this had been different. One of them had been in the water, dangerously close to the unfinished dam. Nothing must interfere with his work. Nothing must harm the dam.</p>
