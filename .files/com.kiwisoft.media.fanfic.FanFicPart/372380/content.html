<P>A.N. As promised, here's Miley's POV. Enjoy!</P><P><U>Closer When Dreaming â€“ Chapter Four</U></P><P>Moving into our new apartment had gone really smoothly. Daddy had insisted on sorting out our bedroom furniture first meaning that our beds were ready that first evening. For the next week, or ten days if you want to be really specific about it, Lilly and I both slept in our own rooms but then on the morning of the eleventh day I woke up to the most beautiful sight that I never thought I'd see again. Lilly sleeping soundly next to me, or practically under me as our usual sleeping positions go. I happily smile down at her sleeping form before kissing her collar bone and sighing in contentment. I couldn't believe how much I had missed this. I didn't care why she was there, I didn't care that she had got in my bed without permission, this is Lilly I was talking about. I put my head back onto her shoulder and extended the moment I got to hold Lilly by not waking her up. I wanted this to last as long as possible. Who knew when the opportunity would raise itself again.</P><P>I felt Lilly stir and then stiffen. I knew she had realised where she was and my heart dropped, maybe she had sleepwalked or something. So I sat up, smiled at her to show I wasn't angry and then went into the bathroom for a shower. She wasn't there when I was finished.</P><P>The next few days, I didn't wake up to find Lilly with me and every day my heart broke just a little bit more and then about a week after that morning, I woke up in the middle of the night to Lilly shouting in her room. I quickly stood up and ran into her room where I could see she was in the throes of a pretty nasty nightmare. I couldn't make out what she was saying but I was too busy running over to her side and stroking her hair to try to figure it out. The minute I started to whisper soothing words to her, she stopped tossing and grabbed the hand I had placed on her arm and leaned into the touch of my other hand on her forehead. She wouldn't let go of my hand which was pulled onto her stomach where she held it tightly. I gently crawled onto the bed next to her, noticing that my hand was in the place it usually rested when I woke up in the morning. I smiled at this a moved as close as I could to Lilly and whispered goodnight before I let sleep pull me into my own, thankfully nice peaceful dreams.</P><P>When we woke up the next day, Lilly looked at me a little confused. I hesitated for a moment. Lilly hated her own weaknesses and I knew that she would consider nightmares a weakness so I smiled at her and told her I missed sleeping next to her. She had smiled back at me and nothing more was said. We had a knack for leaving things unsaid.</P><P>After that, Lilly would end up in my room most nights. I never questioned this change but on the odd night she didn't turn up in my room, I'd go to hers and she didn't seem to mind this either. We always seemed to wait for the other person to fall to sleep first because I never saw Lilly come into my room and Lilly was always sleep when I went into hers but either way this continued for a few months.</P><P>Lilly and I were both busy with college and Hannah and Lola. She had insisted on doing all my Hannah stuff with me. I think it was to keep me from over working myself as she would constantly remind me that I was supposed to be halving my workload. She was an angel about it though and helped me pick and chose which concerts and appearances to do. One of the concerts she helped me pick was for a children's charity concert.</P><P>After we got home that evening from the concert I was ready for bed and lying on top of the covers staring at the ceiling. I wanted to be lying next to Lilly already. I didn't care she wasn't asleep yet, we didn't when we had out sleepovers, I reasoned to myself. I stood up and walked to my door, before pausing and taking a step back. Could I really do this? Could I really go to Lilly's room like this? I nodded my head, yes I could. Lilly hadn't said anything about it. I walked back to the door and opened it but I didn't walk through it. What if she didn't want to upset me? No that was silly, she came into my room most nights. I took a few steps closer to Lilly's room before turning back on my heel and walking into my room again. I couldn't do this. I took a deep breath and chastised myself. This was Lilly my best friend. I walked back into the hall and hesitated only for a second in front of her door before opening and walking inside. I glanced at Lilly as I walked towards her. She was reading her English Literature book that she had been reading in my dressing room earlier. I smiled at this and before she could say anything I slid under her covers and cuddled into her side, at once feeling better as Lilly's armed snaked around my shoulders.</P><P>From that night onwards I always went to Lilly's room after I was ready for bed.</P><P>I started leaving things of mine in her room, accidentally at first but then one morning I woke up almost late for my lecture and when I got back to our apartment that afternoon, Lilly had cleared out one of her drawers on her dresser and had already put my pyjamas I had flung off on my way to the bathroom in there, all neatly folded up. I loved my drawer.</P><P>A few months after this, we go to see our parents and end up at the beach. I just wanted to spend some time at our old hang outs with Lilly but there was this guy who would not leave me alone. He was cute and all but I just wasn't interested in him. Eventually we managed to ditch him and I did not give him my number but for some reason Lilly was really quiet, like she was deep in thought, the whole way back to our apartment.</P><P>The next morning I woke up first as usual and sighed as I tried to figure out what had made Lilly so upset the day before. She had been fine until the beach and then that guy turned up. It couldn't have been that she liked him could it? And she was upset that he was taking an interest in me instead? No that was silly, Lilly gave up those jealous type feelings about guys years ago ... maybe she was jealous he was flirting with me and <I>she </I>wanted to flirt with me. I rolled my eyes at my wishful thinking as I felt Lilly begin to stir. I decided to pretend to be asleep to give her change to sneak away if she wanted but what happened next shocked me.</P><P>Lilly kissed me! She actually kissed me and then whispered that she loves me! Was I dreaming?</P><P>I opened my eyes to see her closed ones and watched as they opened. I could see the panic in her eyes as she saw that I was awake and I could almost hear the word she would have said if she had spoken aloud.</P><P>... Shit.</P><P>A.N. I have one final chapter after this so my originally only a one shot spiralled into a five shot (if such a word/thing exists lol) Anyways please let me know what you think, thanks Nicki xoxo</P>
