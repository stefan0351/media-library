<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 16 -->

<p>The cemetery was lit only by the soft eerie light of the crescent moon.
The tombstones, mausoleums, and surrounding trees cast strange shadows
that were able to hide a multitude of evils.
The tall dark figure watched the two young women as they made their way
across the grounds. A patchy ground fog hid their feet to the ankles. A
smile crossed his lips as he watched the two make their way cautiously
from shadow to shadow.</p>

<p>The figure had watched with interest as the pair encountered young but
determent vampires, three encounters, three dusted vampires. It was
clear to him that the petite blonde and her red haired companion hadn't
lost anything since he'd last seen them. They had taken out their
opponents with impressive speed and efficiency of motion. </p>

<p>He was beginning to wonder what had prompted Giles' frantic call for
help. The ex-watcher was not known to panic unnecessarily and the tall
figure knew the deceptively mild mannered man would not risk the
inevitable temper fest if the Slayer found out he was here, unless
absolutely necessary. ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>After all Buffy had made it quite clear his presence was no longer
needed when she'd told him of her new relationship with Willow. Granted
he had not reacted well but considering she'd just sprung it on him with
no warning what so ever. What had she expected?
ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>The real trouble was that by the time he'd had enough time to sort out
how he really felt about her newly discovered lifestyle, they'd already
had a devastating fight, complete with the usual vicious comments
recriminations and nasty name calling. He was sure that the young
sensitive girl wasn't about to forgive him. </p>

<p>Of course, in her defence, she'd never would have been so enraged at him
if he'd confined his venomous verbal remarks to her. But when he'd
verbally attacked Willow he realized, too late, that he'd crossed the
line. </p>

<p>Buffy had gone ballistic, and in a flurry of punches and kicks she'd
driven him from Giles' home demanding that he never come near her or her
friends again. He was told to keep his bigoted small minded opinions
away from them. ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>The next evening he'd packed what he wanted of his belongings and left
Sunnydale and not returned until tonight.</p>

<p>Oh sure he'd tried to apologize for his stupidity, but his one time love
had coldly rebuked each attempt without hearing them. At home he had a
small mountain of returned unopened letters, packages, flowers and candy
as evidence of his heart felt regret for hurting Buffy and her beloved
witch Willow. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;If I'd only kept it between us and left the love of her life out of
it.&lt;&gt; the brooding vampire speculated. &lt;&gt;All that would probably be
behind us by now and I wouldn't have to hide to help her.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>He sighed deeply when he thought of how much he missed the easy
camaraderie they'd shared for years. How the sound of her laugh had been
able to lift his soul from the deepest abyss. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Well I guess that's all over now.&lt;&gt; he thought, as the almost constant
depression slipped back over him. &lt;&gt;There's no way old Angel would be
welcome back in Sunnydale as far as Buffy Summers is concerned. Gods I
miss her, even just as a friend.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Angel's thoughts were interrupted when sudden movements appeared in the
shadows that the two girls were coming close to. </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow walked through the cemetery as if this was any other
night, but no matter how casual they appeared on the surface, underneath
they were both tensed and on guard with every sense alert, scanning the
depths of each shadow for signs of the expected ambush. </p>

<p>As they went along on their regular patrol, they tested and learned the
limits of their newly acquired mental link. </p>

<p>So far they'd figured out that they shared thoughts and emotions but it
wasn't like they were talking to each other. It was more like they
instantly knew what the other was thinking and feeling. They'd also
figured out how to block each other out so they each could have a
certain amount of privacy. </p>

<p>When Willow sensed a presence watching them earlier, she let Buffy have
access to her thoughts so she was warned. </p>

<p>To her frustration the witch was unable penetrate the barriers the
entity had erected around itself and wasn't able to identify it as
friend or foe. </p>

<p>"Damn!" Willow muttered under her breath. "I still can't figure out who
that is out there." </p>

<p>"No prob Wills." Buffy said softly to reassure her friend. "If they
weren't friendly..." </p>

<p>"...they would have attacked by now." Willow finished with a smirk. "I
realize that but not knowing makes me..." </p>

<p>"...nervous." Buffy finished, smiling back at her companion. "Relax
Wills, I've got a feeling I know..." </p>

<p>"Angel?" Willow asked surprised at her lover's thoughts. </p>

<p>"Yeah, I think he's trying to make amends for what he said." the Slayer
whispered. "I know he's sorry, but after 246 years you'd think he'd know
better." </p>

<p>Willow blurted out a laugh at Buffy's comment. </p>

<p>"How long ya' gonna make him suffer?" Willow asked trying to hide her
nervousness. </p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know." Buffy said smiling secretly to her lover. "He looks
so good when he mopes, I'd hate to be the one to spoil his fun." </p>

<p>Their levity was interrupted when Buffy's "Slayer sense" went off,
alerting her to the nearness of her favorite kind of opponents. Willow
could feel her mate's sudden tension and immediately knew it's cause.
ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>Buffy stepped back, placing herself between her beloved Willow and the
shadows and assumed her combat stance. </p>

<p>Three large extremely mean looking vampires glided from the shadows. </p>

<p>"Hello Slayer." one of the creatures purred menacingly. "I can't tell
you how truly delighted we are to see you." </p>

<p>"Is that so?" Buffy said, trying to buy time for her allies to get into
position. She could hear Willow chanting under her breath. "Do you
really have that much of a death wish, vamp?" </p>

<p>She used that particular nickname for the undead because she knew how
much they hated it. </p>

<p>"Ah that remains to be seen, my tiny Slayer." the spokesman said scoring
a hit of his own. </p>

<p>She looked at the still handsome face of the lead vampire, and wondered
if she'd ever met him before he was turned, he looked familiar. She was
going to ask but decided it didn't matter now and shrugged it off. </p>

<p>"No love, you've never met him before." Willow giggled into the Slayer's
ear. "He's from out of town. I think it's time." </p>

<p>Buffy turned slightly and nodded her head to let her partner know she
understood. </p>

<p>"So are we here to fight or are you trying to bore me to death?" Buffy
asked sarcastically, contempt dripping from her voice. "Don't any of you
know anything new?" </p>

<p>The lead vampire snarled at the small blonde's insult and losing control
he launched himself at the Slayer. She met his attack with a flurry of
spinning kicks and back fists that not only stopped the undead
assailant, but began to drive him back toward a big ornate tombstone.
One of his allies snuck around behind Buffy in an attempt to blind side
her. </p>

<p>"Buffy! behind you!" Willow shouted to warn her mate. </p>

<p>Thanks to Willow's warning Buffy caught the vamp's movement and ducking
under his punch, she launched a side snap kick into his chest, jumping
up as her second attacker flew backwards to slam into a tombstone. </p>

<p>As he straightened back up Buffy threw her arm forward releasing a long
sharply pointed wooden stake that blurred through the air to penetrate
the vamp's chest piercing his heart. ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>Pain and surprise registered on his face just in time for him to explode
in a cloud of dust. </p>

<p>The Slayer turned her attention back to her original opponent.
unobserved by Buffy the third vampire launched a more cautious attack on
the Slayer's red haired companion. </p>

<p>Surprised by the attack Willow fell back using her staff to fend off the
vampire's assault. ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>When Buffy's opponent suddenly turned and ran, she took off after him
unaware that her Willow wasn't right behind her. </p>

<p>"Come on Wills." Buffy shouted enthusiastically over her shoulder. "I
think this is it!" </p>

<p>Buffy ran at full speed disappearing over a slight rise that placed her
out of sight, unaware that her single minded concentration had cut her
off from her lover's thoughts. </p>

<p>Willow was too busy holding back the third vampire that was slowly
forcing her back toward an old vine covered mausoleum. </p>

<p>The harder he pressed the harder she tried to concentrate. Finally her
extra training and natural defences took over and the mystical eerie
neon green glow of her metaphysical powers began to rise.
The brighter the glow the stronger her counterattack became. The tide of
battle slowly turned in Willow's favor and as she began pushing the
vampire back she forgot to guard her own back.
ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>A vampire that neither Buffy nor Willow had detected earlier slipped out
of the shadow of the mausoleum and stealthily approached the witch from
behind. </p>

<p>Knowing that his mistress wanted this slender girl alive with a minimum
of damage the vamp was preparing to strike her from behind. </p>

<p>Anticipating his rewards the vampire failed to check for any other
possible opponents, an error he didn't live long enough to repeat. </p>

<p>"Willow, down!" a familiar voice shouted from behind the vampire she was
facing. </p>

<p>Without thinking Willow dropped to her knees, a blur flew over her head
and a stake appeared in the chest of the vampire that was sneaking up
behind her, and as he disappeared in a swirling cloud of dust a dark
figure appeared behind the vampire facing her. </p>

<p>An arm wrapped around his throat and the vampire was bent backwards over
a tombstone and an arm came down hard driving a sharp wooden stake into
his heart. </p>

<p>As that one joined his comrade in a dust cloud Willow rose to her feet
and looked into the dark eyes of her rescuer. </p>

<p>"Thank you Angel." Willow said gratefully and smiling at him shyly. "We
were wondering when you were going to join us, we missed you." </p>

<p>"It was no big deal, Willow." Angel said embarrassed by the girl's
gratitude. "I'm just glad I was here for you." </p>

<p>"Me too." the witch answered awkwardly, remembering why he'd been gone
so long. "Does this mean you forgive Buffy and I for being in love?" </p>

<p>He nodded his head looking down in shame over his rude comments, that
he'd made about both girls. He started to say something but stopped when
he saw the shy smile disappear from her lips. ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ </p>

<p>Angel could tell something was wrong. </p>

<p>Willow was suddenly overcome with feelings of fear, revulsion, and rage
that swept over her. The sudden change in the girl's expression
concerned Angel. </p>

<p>"Willow?" he inquired worried "What is it? What's wrong?" </p>

<p>The witch's green glowing eyes locked on the souled vampire's dark gaze,
a look of pure horror came over her face and she whispered the one word
that conveyed her feelings of hopeless soul shattering terror.
"BUFFY!" </p>
