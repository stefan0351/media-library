<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ I Dream Of Sammy -->

<p>Brooke twirled around in front of the mirror admiring her
reflection. The dress was perfect. Mid-length, smokey red with a waist hugging
bodice and it was strapless, coming up just above her breasts. It had a short
matching jacket that went over it. Not her usual style but what she wanted for
this go around. Sam's pants set was the same color with a little white trim and
classically cut. Together they looked awesome. Sam smiled at her from a few feet
away. </p>
<p>"Very nice," she whistled at Brooke. Brooke gave her a toothy
grin. </p>
<p>"Not bad yourself," she responded. Sam spun around so Brooke
could get a good look at the whole outfit. It really did look good on her. "Nice
ass." </p>
<p>"Brooke!" Sam scolded but the grin on her face gave her away.
Brooke was glad that they were back to teasing each other like they used to. The
incident with Pierce had come close to destroying them, or at least Sam and it
had taken a long time to settle back into their normal routine. Sam's depression
still reared its ugly head from time to time but together they fought their way
through it. </p>
<p>"So, we're really going to go to the Prom?" Brooke asked just
to make sure although she knew there was no way Sam would let her miss it. </p>
<p>"I certainly hope so for the amount of money we've spent on
tickets, outfits and the limo," Sam joked. "Besides, I wanna see everyone's face
when I walk in with the prettiest, most sexy girl at Kennedy High on my arm."
Brooke arched an eyebrow at her. </p>
<p>"I thought you were going with me," she pouted. Sam folded her
arms across her chest and sighed dramatically. </p>
<p>"I was, although you keep that up and I might change my mind,"
she said dryly. Brooke smiled at her. </p>
<p>"I was just joking, Sammy," Brooke said as she walked up and
wrapped her arms around Sam's waist. Sam wrinkled her nose. </p>
<p>"I know, Princess," she said. "I want prom night to be special
for you so is there anything else you want besides the limo?" Brooke thought for
a few minutes, genuinely touched by Sam's offer. Sam was determined to make Prom
night everything Brooke could possibly imagine but all Brooke really wanted was
to have a nice time with her. </p>
<p>"Just you," she finally told Sam. "And to have a great time."
Sam nodded with a smile. </p>
<p>"Done," Sam said. Brooke laughed causing Sam to look at her
strangely. "What?" </p>
<p>"Nothing, I just had this image of you dressed like the woman
from I Dream of Jeanie and crossing your arms and saying `Yes, Master'," Brooke
giggled. Sam's eyebrows raised. </p>
<p>"Ooo, costumes and dominance fantasies. Didn't know you had
that in you, Princess. Kinky," she joked, loving the sudden blush that rose to
Brooke's cheeks. </p>

<p>Brooke kicked off her covers with a sigh. (There are 87
ceiling tiles) she sighed. (I hate it when I can't sleep) She rolled over onto
her stomach and punched her pillow, trying to get comfortable but she was too
wound up. Everytime she closed her eyes, she relived that horrible spring night
when Nicole's car came racing towards her. She hadn't been this bad off in a
long time. With a final frustrated growl, she got up out of bed and headed to
Sam's room. </p>
<p>To her surprise, Sam wasn't in bed. She was sitting in the
window with her Walkman on with her feet up on the windowsill, letting the warm
spring breeze flow over her. Brooke frowned. While Sam was notorious for
suffering from occasional bouts of insomnia, she usually ended up in Brooke's
room when they were apart, not sitting alone in the dark. It made Brooke wonder
exactly how much sleep Sam really got and how often. </p>
<p>(Does she come to my room everytime she can't sleep or only
sometimes?) Brooke wondered, bothered by the thought that Sam didn't sleep. (Is
she not telling me something?) She walked up behind Sam and placed her hands
gently on Sam's back causing Sam to jump slightly. Sam reached up and removed
her earphones and gave Brooke a quick smile. </p>
<p>"Hey, Princess, what's the matter? Can't sleep?" she asked.
Brooke sat down on the edge of the bed a few feet away. </p>
<p>"Shouldn't I be asking you the same thing?" she countered. Sam
frowned before looking back out the window. </p>
<p>"It's a beautiful night," Sam said instead. Brooke sighed.
(Defensive Sam, not a good sign) </p>
<p>"Yes it is, Sammy. But why are you awake?" Sam looked back at
her. </p>
<p>"Why are you?" Brooke sighed again. (Defensive and stubborn.
Great) </p>
<p>"I'm wired," she explained knowing the only way to get Sam to
talk was to talk first. "And having flashback problems." </p>
<p>"Ah," was all Sam said. </p>
<p>"It's been almost a year," Brooke started. She saw Sam nod.
"That's got to make you think, Sammy." </p>
<p>"Uh-huh," Sam responded. Brooke wanted to kick her.
(Defensive, stubborn, and cavewoman. Batting 1000, Brooke) </p>
<p>"It was a night a lot like this one," Sam said suddenly,
startling Brooke. "Warm but breezy and clear. I never thought my life would come
down to one second caught in a pair of halogen headlights." Brooke leaned
forward slightly. </p>
<p>"But your life is more than that one moment, Sammy," she said
patiently. "It's made up of a series of moments. Some good, some not so good but
you can't spend your time stuck in that one." Sam looked at her with an
unreadable expression. </p>
<p>"It's like that U2 song, `Stuck in a Moment'- that you can't
get out of. And while I don't regret it and wouldn't trade anything that came
after it, Brooke, you especially, I can't help thinking that I'm still stuck
there. Doomed to replay that moment." </p>
<p>"We both are, at times, Sam," Brooke told her. "But we have to
stop letting it run our lives. Maybe this prom will do that for us, give us the
closure we need to move on," she said hopefully. Sam gave her a small smile. </p>
<p>"You're a pathetic optimist, you know that?" Brooke smiled
back at her. </p>
<p>"Yes, I learned it at Cheerleading camp," she joked. She
stretched out her hand for Sam. "Seriously, we both need to sleep, Sammy, so
come to bed." Sam grasped Brooke's hand and let herself be led to bed. They
settled in together, snuggling close. </p>
<p>"I love you, Brooke," Sam whispered. Brooke kissed her
forehead. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Sam." </p>
