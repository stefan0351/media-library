<!-- Becoming One \ Part 3: Gathering -->

<p>Buffy walked into Giles' house at a little past nine a.m. She couldn't concentrate on anything. Sitting in her classes would have been pointless. She just kept seeing his face. The evil, the hatred, and passion toward her that was in his eyes. She just wanted to wake up, and then he'd be gone. She wasn't expecting this. When she had said goodbye to Angel, she thought that was the end. Angelus was trapped, and Angel was free.</P>
<p>Angel, the true Angel, was at rest now. Wherever souls went once they passed on. But why would Hell spit out Angelus? He was so evil, so homicidal; she pictured him revered in Hell, kind of like a demon's paradise. She just didn't understand why everything was always against her.</P>
<p>As soon as things started to settle down, she was punished again. But for what? She had always done what she was supposed to. Well, except quit the Council. That didn't matter though, did it? She was still fighting after all. And Willow. She didn't deserve this either, but Angelus would do whatever it took to take her out, and if he ever got Willow she…well, she probably would die.</P>
<p>Willow had wanted to come with her, but she told her to stay and be the responsible student. There was no reason for both of them to put a blemish on their college careers. Plus, she had a feeling that by the time she stopped him, if she stopped him, there'd be a whole lot of blemishes to try and clear up.</P>
<p>She walked over to the couch, where Giles had fallen asleep. She shook him.</P>
<p>"Wake up, Giles. You can't be sleeping at a time like this!"</P>
<p>He opened his eyes, and when his vision cleared, he jumped a little.</P>
<p>"Buffy…what…knock…"</P>
<p>"If you didn't want me to barge in, you shouldn't have given me a key. Now, please tell me you found something. I left early, got on a bus, and I'm missing classes because I'm completely freaked."</P>
<P>Giles pulled himself out of his early morning drowsiness, and became concerned. "Are you all right? Willow? Oz?"</P>
<p>"Yeah, he hasn't…nothing serious. Will and I couldn't sleep last night, and I've been having Oz call every hour. He hasn't come after you or Xander has he?"</P>
<p>"No, not yet. I can tell you some theories I have, but beyond that…resources on Hell, and most everything else, are severely limited now."</P>
<p>"You're not angry with me for quitting are you?"</P>
<p>"No, of course not. The Council has lost sight of the reasons it was founded to begin with. But that really is not the issue at the moment." Giles said, clearly agitated at his former employer. "I'm surprised Willow didn't come along."</P>
<p>"She wanted to, but in case we found anything really bad, I didn't want to…what am I saying? I can't stop her from hearing the bad stuff anymore." Buffy frowned. Giles was staring at her. "Sorry. She just can't pay much attention to her professor right now. This is really getting to her too."</P>
<p>"This is truly amazing. I've read about telepathy, mainly between demon species, and I've actually gone into heavier research ever since Willow told me, and it's…"</P>
<p>"Angelus?"</P>
<p>"Right…I'm sorry. Well, Angel's soul is…"</P>
<p>"At rest. Peaceful. I knew this."</P>
<p>"My point is, that unlike the last…incident with Angelus, where Angel's soul was trapped in between worlds, awaiting the outcome of whatever was going to happen to his body, he is not trapped anymore. He is fully in what is commonly called the afterlife."</P>
<p>"So Angel's soul won't be a factor in stopping Angelus."</P>
<p>"Yes."</P>
<p>"Okay…" Buffy took a breath, and 'let' Willow know. "So why is he here? He should be trapped forever."</P>
<p>"I don't know exactly. For people with goodness and purity Hell is damnation, but for demons, especially one as vile as Angelus, Hell is a haven. However, given his track record and his obsession with you," he paused, "it's obvious that it would be more beneficial to the darker forces to have him on Earth."</P>
<p>"To hunt down me and my friends. The last people who stand in their way of making Earth their mega evil playground." Giles nodded. She could see that even he was worried.</P>
<p>"Just be on guard. Don't let him disrupt your life."</P>
<p>"How can I not? I have to stay here and watch out for you guys. I'll get Willow, cause she wants to be here and Oz…"</P>
<p>"Listen to me. I've told Xander, and he has protection. As do I.  The last thing you should let him see is that his arrival his affected you, because that's what he wants most. To see you suffering."</P>
<p>Buffy hesitated before responding. "Okay, but you have to promise to watch out for mom."</P>
<p>"You have my word." Buffy started to walk to the door, and he stopped her. "In regards to the telepathy, you can block your thoughts from one another, if necessary."</P>
<p>"The last thing we wanna do is hide from one another. Especially now."</P>
<p>"Just be aware of that. I'm just beginning to research this, and as I've found out too many times before, as much as something may be a benefit, there are downsides as well."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Wiping up the broken pieces of a wineglass, Xander was done for the night. He didn't realize fancy restaurants were open this late. Well really, the last diners had left at around 10:30, but he wasn't let off work until the place was spotless, and it was just coming up on half past eleven. If he looked on the bright side, at least he wasn't cleaning up at McDonald's. Plus, this was the longest he'd held down a job so far.</P>
<P>But if he kept expensive dining materials, he'd be fired pretty soon. He went back into the kitchen area and dumped breaking glasses and other the pieces in the trash. He looked up and saw the manager giving him an angry stare.</P>
<P>"Sorry. You can take it out of my paycheck."</P>
<P>"Thanks for the permission, Harris. One more time. One more time and you're gone. Hear me?"</P>
<P>"Yeah. Sorry."</P>
<P>Checking to make sure his cross was still firmly in his back pocket, he walked out the kitchen entrance/exit, and into an alley. </P>
<P>That was the other downside to working late. Vampire attacks. And now that Angelus was back, he wished he had pushed just a little harder for the dayshift. As soon as he had heard the news, he wasn't so much scared as he was angry.</P>
<P>They had been rid of him. Finally. And Xander felt especially pleased at that. The guy was a vampire, a killer, and a bastard. He had never seen the difference between demon and soul, even though Angel had saved his life. He always hated him. </P>
<P>Jealousy for Buffy was what started it, and in the back of his mind he knew that he was being idiotic. But when Angel became Angelus once again, his hatred was finally justified. It had taken awhile for everybody to realize what needed to be done, and there had been loss, but Buffy had eventually sent Angelus packing.</P>
<P>This time everyone was on his side. They all wanted Angelus dead, and nobody was considering any other options. Of course, if they had listened to him the first time…no, forget the past. This time, Angelus would be dust, and he'd see it. It gave him a sense of purpose again, because ever since the school blew up, he had been wandering.</P>
<P>Job after job after job. While everyone moved on and changed with their new circumstances, he still tried to hang on to the days at the library. Researching, contributing. When the Scooby Gang was together every second. Now, he had just become another useless, faceless member of the American working class. What else was he going to do? He had never set any expectations for himself, although maybe he should have. But nobody really expected him to do much of anything, so why should he? </P>
<P>Well, that wasn't entirely true. Buffy and Willow tried to push him into going to college, and on rare occasions, Cordelia had also. But he would get crushed in college. He knew that. And the people who were supposed to encourage him to do something were his parents, but…well, they weren't too concerned with him at all.</P>
<P>"Here's an idea. The Xander Harris Self-pity Tour. Come see the loser." He muttered as he reached the end of the alley.</P>
<P>Right before he reached the sidewalk, a figure jumped down from the fire escape that was above him on the building.</P>
<P>"I'd pay to see that. Seeing people pity themselves, especially you, gives me such a happy feeling." Angelus said.</P>
<P>Xander stood frozen for a moment, and then pulled out the cross he had responsibly brought, and held it out in front of him. Angelus winced a little, but didn't move.</P>
<P>"A cross, Xander? I thought we were past that."</P>
<P>"I like distance. I've been hurt."</P>
<P>"No you haven't. But you will be." Angelus kicked the cross out of Xander's hands. "Don't tell me that's all you brought. Although," He had an amused look in his dark eyes, "I guess I shouldn't have expected any more of a challenge from you."</P>
<P>Xander snapped out of it. He was impatient, and wasn't in the mood. "So, let's go. What are you going to do?"</P>
<P>"I like to think myself as a guy who's open to ideas. What would you like me to do?"</P>
<P>"Die." Xander said, coldly.</P>
<P>"We talked about this before didn't we?" As Angelus moved forward, Xander moved further back into the alley. "As I remember, there was a threat. 'You're going to die and I'm going to be there when you do.' </P>
<P>"So typical of you. Only brave and macho when you were sure nothing could hurt you. In a crowded hospital, surrounded by people. But now there's no one here. </P>
<P>"Buffy's white knight. Well," He chuckled, "not anymore. Now you're just a peasant."</P>
<P>Xander just stood, unmoving.</P>
<P>"What? No words of bravery? So what happened, Xander? Nobody care about you anymore? Lose your girl? Cordelia would have been a pleasure to taste. I'm guessing you never got that chance." </P>
<P>Xander punched him in the face, full of rage. Angelus wasn't even fazed, but didn't retaliate. When he didn't, Xander got a little braver.</P>
<P>"You lost yours." He spat, angrily.</P>
<P>"Buffy. She's good for about five minutes, and then the attraction wears off. Loving her was his mistake."</P>
<p>Xander grinned. "Sorry, I never made the distinction between good you and evil you. You love her. And it kills you. The evilest demon on the planet loves the Slayer. She'll never be yours; she'll never be evil. So you want to kill her instead."</P>
<p>"You never did know when to keep your mouth shut. Eventually, it's going to get you into trouble."</P>
<p>Xander didn't listen. "It must really get to you that she's not all in pieces and weeping. That she totally pushed you out of her mind and moved on. To a female. That must really sting. </P>
<P>"Your reputation as a torturer and killer demon took a blow, and," Xander said, and in a moment of foolishness walked up to him, "your 'performance' as a man was so bad that she switched sides. Buffy and Willow will have a connection that you never had with her, and never will. Talk about taking a major ego shot. </P>
<P>"I shouldn't be feeling sorry for myself, I should be feeling sorry for you."</P>
<p>Angelus' face changed to its vampiric form, and he picked Xander up.</P>
<P>"I warned you." </P>
<p>He threw him against the chain link fence at the far end of the alley. Xander wasn't unconscious, but he was badly bruised, and guessed he had a few broken bones. Before he could focus, Angelus was already over him.</P>
<p>"You know, maybe soul boy and I weren't so different after all."</P>
<p>"Yeah…?"</P>
<p>"He hated you just as much as I do. He didn't maim you because he respected your loyalty to her, but I, however, could care less about that."&#9;</P>
<p>On the other side of the fence, more vampires reached through, and started to pull Xander up and over to their side.</P>
<p>"What are you doing?"</P>
<p>"Gathering recruits. And they need to eat." Xander looked horrified. Angelus faked a look of sympathy. "You won't feel a thing." He punched Xander hard in the face, and knocked him out. "Well, except maybe that."</P>
<p>Satisfied, he scaled the fence and walked to his car, and began to think. Was there something deeper to Buffy and Willow's relationship? What did Xander mean by 'connection?' He looked at the kid's body being pulled into the car by his men, and smiled. He knew only one person who would be able to tell him what he needed to know.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow watched Buffy's reflection through the glare on her computer screen. Buffy was lying on the bed studying. She had missed the entire day and was really trying to catch up. Not that she wasn't happy that Buffy was focusing on doing well, but she knew that was only part of the reason she was burying herself in the books.</P>
<P>They had gone on a patrol for at least six hours around the campus, and the graveyard closest to it. There had been no sign of Angelus, or any other vampires for that matter, and Buffy was worried. And so was she.</P>
<P>She and Buffy both had the feeling, despite Giles' reassurances, that something was wrong. They had called his house several times, and he was fine. And Xander said he was working late, and he said he'd check in once he got home. Still, Xander should have called by now, and there was still a lot of night left to get through.</P>
<P>Finishing the last line on her paper, Willow hit the print button, and turned around.</P>
<P>"How's it coming?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"I'm tired." Buffy closed her book, and sat up.</P>
<P>"I know. We both are."</P>
<P>"It's just…Giles is telling me to go on and pretend like he isn't messing up my life, but I can't. He is, he frightens me, and I hate him for it. I feel like any second he could just pop up and…"<I>  </P>
</I><P>"All we can do is wait." Willow said sitting next to her. </P>
<P>She hated that they had no other choice, but they had no idea what he was up to, and beyond wandering around hoping to get lucky, or fall into a trap, they couldn't do anything else. All the patrols were wearing them both down, and they couldn't afford to be not at full strength. That's what he would want.</P>
<P>"You're not the only one who hates it. How come the good guys are always the ones with the disadvantage?"</P>
<P>The phone rang, and somebody knocked on the door.</P>
<I><P>'I'll get the door, you get the phone.'</P>
</I><P>Willow nodded, and picked up the phone. There were definitely advantages to telepathy.</P>
<P>"Giles…hi. One second." She whispered.</P>
<P>Buffy walked over to the door, grabbing a stake. She stood to the right of the knob, and slowly turned it. Then, she flung the door open, ready to drive the stake into…Oz.</P>
<P>"Not how I usually answer the door, but your way definitely has its place. Good way to scare off girl scouts." He said.</P>
<P>"And vampires. Sorry, Oz. Just a little on edge."</P>
<P>"Understandable. Just thought I'd stop by. See how things were going."</P>
<P>"Still don't have anything to go on. If you wanna join the tension fest, feel free."</P>
<P>Willow, seeing it was Oz, smiled in greeting, and held out the phone to Buffy.</P>
<P>"Giles found out some more stuff on telepathy, he thought you might want to know."</P>
<P>"Any extra benefits?" Buffy grinned, happy to get her mind off evil, and onto her and Willow for a change.</P>
<P>"He didn't say." Willow grinned in return.</P>
<P>Buffy picked up the phone, and Willow walked over to Oz.</P>
<p>"How you holding up?" He asked.</P>
<p>"I think waiting is the worst part. We're both…stressed, but she knows she's going to have to fight him and face him, and she's…barely holding on. Before this telepathy thing, and our being together, I never realized how hard it was for her to keep from breaking down.</P>
<P>"Every second she's trying to stay cool and calm…"</P>
<P>"Makes you have more respect for what she does. How hard she works."</P>
<P>Willow smiled. "Yeah, it does. It also makes me want to hold her and make this all go away. I don't know how she keeps going when she's so bogged down inside. I couldn't do that."</P>
<P>"She has you, that's how. And yes you could keep going, because you're doing it right now. With her. She doesn't have to struggle alone anymore."</P>
<P>She thought for a second. "No, she doesn't."</P>
<P>Buffy, still talking to Giles, looked up and smiled at her.</P>
<P>(You want us to come over?)</P>
<P>(I really should talk to you two about this in person.)</P>
<P>(Sure, but what is it?)</P>
<P>(It…Excuse me, Buffy. There's someone at the door)</P>
<P>Buffy heard Giles put the phone down, and she waited. A few seconds later, she heard a voice in the background.</P>
<P>(Hello, Rupert.)</P>
<P>It was Angelus. She slammed the phone down, grabbed her already made bag of supplies, and turned to Willow and Oz. He didn't need to be telepathic to know what was going on.</P>
<P>"Van's right outside."</P>
<P>They ran out the door.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"It's always a pleasure to see you." Angelus started to walk forward, but ran into the invisible barrier that blocked his entrance. </P>
<P>"I hope you didn't believe that I’d foolish enough not to reverse the invitation."</P>
<P>"A guy can hope, can't he?"</P>
<P>Giles walked to a side room, and quickly came back with a crossbow, loaded and pointed at Angelus' chest.</P>
<P>"I will fire."</P>
<P>"Even after all that quality time we spent together. That hurts me, really." Giles started to push his finger back on the trigger. "You are better armed then some people, though. I'll give you that."</P>
<P>He pulled Xander into view, and held him by the back of the shirt. Xander was bruised all over his face, his left eye was cut and half open, there were two sets of teeth marks on both sides of his neck, and his left leg was broken.</P>
<P>Giles took one look at him, and was stunned. There was no way Xander could still be alive. But then, he groaned. "Dear God…"</P>
<P>"Oh come on, Rupert. You didn't think I'd come to your doorstep without an insurance policy, did you?"</P>
<P>"Why…?"</P>
<P>"It. Was. Fun. He was out for awhile, but the best part was when his leg snapped. I've heard lots of screams over the years, but…wow. I would've killed him, but it's better to have him alive for now. Well if you can call that alive." He grinned. "I figured a dead body wouldn't really help me."</P>
<P>Giles didn't budge.</P>
<P>"Let me make this clear. If you don't let me in, I'll drain the little blood that's left, out of him, and then crush his skull just to see if there's anything inside. I've always been curious about that. You don't want to test my patience. He did, and well, you can see what the result was."</P>
<P>Giles sighed, about the biggest mistake of his life.</P>
<P>"Come…"</P>
<P>"He's counting on you."</P>
<P>"Come in."</P>
<P>Angelus stepped in, and threw Xander down on the floor. He grabbed the crossbow, and smashed it with his bare hands. He then started to walk around, while Giles leaned over Xander.</P>
<P>"I'll tell ya, you had to be the most resilient person I ever tortured. Got to give you credit there. Hope you're still as tough."</P>
<P>"What do you want?"</P>
<P>"Information." He walked over to Giles' weapons chest, and pulled out a mace. He started swinging it slowly. "It's been a long time since I've used one of these. They say the weapons today are more efficient, but nothing beats the classics."</P>
<P>Still holding the mace, he walked over to the desk where a lamp was shining down on a couple open books. A few notes were written on a piece of paper, and Buffy and Willow's names were included in them. The paper was stuck in between two pages, being used as a bookmark.</P>
<P>He closed one book, and looked at the title. It said, 'THE ABILITY OF TELEPATHY AND METHODS OF CONTROLLING IT'</P>
<P>"Well, isn't this interesting. See? I knew you'd be useful. I'm gonna borrow these."</P>
<P>"I suppose any objection I have to that would mean nothing to you." They stared at one another. "Thought not."</P>
<P>Angelus walked and stood over Giles and Xander.</P>
<P>"I'm finished with you."</P>
<P>"Then go. You've done enough."</P>
<P>"I'll decide when I've done enough." </P>
<P>He raised the mace.</P>
<P>"No, I will." Buffy said, rushing in and kicking the mace out of his hand.</P>
<P>Rather than risk losing the books, he kicked her in the face and she fell backward. Seeing Willow, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that she seemed in pain as well. She seemed to stumble some.</P>
<P>This night was full of surprises. As he made his way past Willow, he looked her right in the eyes.</P>
<P>"You'll die."</P>
<P>"Probably, but not before you do."</P>
<P>She surprised him, her pain from before over, and splashed a bottle of holywater that she had hidden, on his face. He growled fiercely, flung his arm at her, and bolted. She landed on top of Buffy, who broke her fall.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Later, in the hospital Buffy and Willow were talking to Giles.</P>
<P>"He was lucky." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Yes, he'll need extensive transfusions, and he'll have to wear a cast for a few weeks, but the first treatment went well, according to the doctor. He should be released in a few days." Giles said.</P>
<P>"He almost died." Buffy said, angry with Angelus and herself.</P>
<P>"But he didn't. You saved him, and me as well."</P>
<P>"Yeah, after he got pummeled, and after you were forced to invite Angelus in."</P>
<P>"Buffy, tonight was bad, I know that. Xander was hurt, but he'll be okay. It isn't your fault. You may or may not have been able to stop him, but I know Xander doesn't blame you for what happened. The only one who should be blamed, and killed, is Angelus."</P>
<P>"He will be, Will. I swear."</P>
<P>"As much as I agree with that, you must be careful. He took my books on telepathy and," Giles had an apologetic look on his face, "he knows about your connection now. He is obviously targeting the both of you, and eventually, he may learn how to use your telepathic, and from what you've told me from what happened tonight, possibly empathic, abilities to his advantage."</P>
<P>"How?" They asked simultaneously.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>A woman watched from a distance as Angelus sat in the mansion, reading over his newly obtained information. She'd have to interfere more than she had planned on originally. She could see that a plan was most certainly forming in Angelus' mind.</P>
