<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Seven -->

<p>Once. It only happened once and now I'm here while Helena's out there
actually having fun. Wasn't it punishment enough that I got stuck in
a damn window? I mean, I just don't think Barbara understands the
complete humiliation I had to suffer through because of that. Has she
ever been stuck in a window? I don't think so. No. Perfect Barbara
Gordon wouldn't do something like that. She's the one that thinks of
everything ahead of time and doesn't make a single mistake.</p>
<p>And how does she choose to punish me? I'm not allowed to do sweeps. I
have to sit up here in this place and watch what's happening below
without being able to do a damn thing. Of course, she tells me that
she wants me to learn a little something about what she does up here
but I don't see why I need to know. She runs this place just fine. I
want to be out there doing something. I want to be with Helena.</p>
<p>I wonder what she's doing right now, probably fighting off some bully
and rescuing the damsel in distress. She's good at that sort of
thing. She just swoops down in all her leathery glory and kicks the
bad guy's ass without even breaking a sweat. Then she'll usually turn
around look straight into the eyes of who's she's rescuing inquire if
they're okay and then...then she just disappears. If I were out there
with her I'd be right by her side and we'd both disappear into the
night then we'd take a break and she'd buy me ice cream. Of all
things she'd buy me ice cream. The first time she did it really
surprised me, I didn't expect that from her. It was kind of romantic
actually.</p>
<p>Then we'd finish walking the streets and rooftops while checking in
with Oracle every once in a while. She'd tell us if we were needed
somewhere else or if we needed to investigate anything else.
Sometimes she'd just tell us to come home and we'd return to the
clock tower laughing, not because anything particularly funny
happened but just because we're both happy to be back.</p>
<p>We understand what we risk by going out every night. We know what
could happen, so when we return and know Barbara is waiting for us
patiently it makes us playful, although we're normally playful. All
of us are, even Barbara.</p>
<p>If the night were a particularly slow one then we'd all sit down and
discuss our days outside of the night we just shared. Even if the
night was particularly difficult for some reason we'd still sit back
and talk, except we'd talk about what happened and if one of us
wasn't ready to talk yet then we'd just sit around and be with each
other...always happy that we could be together at the end of the night.</p>
<p>"Dinah are you paying any attention to me at all?" Barbara asks in
what sounds like a slightly frustrated tone.</p>
<p>"Of course I am," I put my hands on my hips. "I know everything
you've said."</p>
<p>"And what did I say?"</p>
<p>Oh damn. Well that last thing she said was...well she was talking about
that uh... "That button over there controls the video cameras to
fluctuate between the various surveillance cameras in the city?"</p>
<p>Barbara looks at me for a moment then shakes her head, but she's
smiling.</p>
<p>"Did I get it right?" I ask hopefully because if I did then I'm a lot
better listener than I first thought.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Oh...well damn. "What did you say then?"</p>
<p>"I asked you if you wanted to go out and get some dinner."</p>
<p>Barbara wants to leave the clock tower? As in she actually wants to
step outside when Helena is out and doing something as important as
sweeps? Is this a trick question?</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Is that a question or an answer?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Well do you or don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Dinah." I don't like the way she said my name. It kind of gives me
chills. "Do you or do you not want to go out and have dinner with me?
Personally, I'd like to go out with you so that we can spend some
time together outside of the school and this place. We haven't really
talked in a while and I miss it."</p>
<p>Oh well in that case. "Of course I do. We can go to that restaurant
that just opened up. I know you said something about wanting to go
there when it was being built." So does this mean I'm no longer
punished for going out to a bar? Maybe Barbara is still going to let
me go and do sweeps afterwards. Maybe she thinks she's being harsh on
me.</p>
<p>"When we're done eating we'll come back here and you can play Oracle
for the night."</p>
<p>So that still means I can't do sweeps but I have to watch over the
whole city from above. I don't want to do that. That's hard. That's...
what if something happens to Helena and we lose communications and I
can't talk to her and I don't know what's going on? I don't want to
do that. Barbara is so much better at doing that sort of thing.</p>
<p>"I thought this was supposed to be a purely learning through watching
exercise tonight?"</p>
<p>"You've been watching me for a while now and I think you're ready to
handle whatever might arise tonight. If something gets to be too much
then I'll be right there with you."</p>
<p>She's giving me that look now. That special look that she always
gives me when she wants me to try something new and she knows I
really don't want to. It's that 'I believe in you' look that she's
mastered. She was the first one to ever give me that look and really
mean it. She gave me the look even before Helena did.</p>
<p>"Okay fine. I'll do it."</p>
<p>"Great." Barbara smiles. "You'll do fine. Believe me."</p>
<p>Oh I believe her. I have to believe her. The minute I stop believing
in Barbara is the minute my entire foundation starts to fall apart.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>We're sitting in the restaurant and our orders have already been
taken. Barbara and I haven't really said all that much to each other
but I think that's just because Barbara is waiting for me to say
something. I wonder what she expects me to say. I don't need to say
anything. She can stop staring at me now with that expectant look on
her face. I don't want to say anything. I have nothing to say. We've
already talked about everything I needed to talk about.</p>
<p>"I didn't drink when I was at the bar you know." I don't know where
that came from.</p>
<p>Barbara nods. "I know."</p>
<p>"And Helena already knew that I was going out so it's not like no one
knew where I was." Where am I going with this exactly?</p>
<p>"Barbara nods again and takes a sip of her drink. "I know."</p>
<p>"Then why are you punishing me?" Yes whining is always good. Makes me
sound just so mature.</p>
<p>"I'm not."</p>
<p>Oh yes well that makes perfect since. She's not letting me go out on
sweeps because she's rewarding me. "You're not?"</p>
<p>"No Dinah, I'm not. You know you shouldn't have gone to that bar but
you're almost eighteen years old, you can pretty much make your own
decisions and I know that sometimes I can seem a little overbearing
but...well I just want you to be careful."</p>
<p>I guess it's my turn now to say, "I know."</p>
<p>"Well now that that's all settled why don't you tell me how you and
Helena are coming along? You know she came and talked to me the night
you got stuck in the window."</p>
<p>"She did?" Why didn't she tell me about this? I knew she wanted to
talk to Barbara but she never told me that she already had. Although,
lately she has sort of seemed like there's been something on her mind
that she just doesn't want to talk about yet. I've decided to give
her space. I figure when she really wants to talk about it then
she'll come to me and if she doesn't come to me soon then I'll force
it out of her.</p>
<p>"Yes she did. She wanted to know how I felt about your relationship."</p>
<p>"And?" I prompt.</p>
<p>"Nothing really," Barbara shrugs. "She just wanted to know how I
felt."</p>
<p>"What'd you say?"</p>
<p>"I told her that what I thought didn't matter but that I support you
both anyway."</p>
<p>I nod. "Well that makes since. I knew that already though."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Barbara looks down at the tablecloth and I know she's
thinking about what to say next. "I'm going to go away for a weekend...
eventually."</p>
<p>Well I wasn't expecting that. "What?"</p>
<p>"Wade and I, we're going away for the weekend." She explains
hesitantly. "I just thought I'd tell you."</p>
<p>Hey wait. "So me running all the heavy equipment tonight, is that
like a trial run?"</p>
<p>Barbara clears her throat. "Yes."</p>
<p>So I'm not being punished I'm just being trained as the standby. I
can handle being the standby. "Well why didn't you just say that
before. It would have made me pay closer attention."</p>
<p>Barbara raises her brow at me. "You should have been paying attention
anyway."</p>
<p>Well if you wanted to use the whole logic argument then what she says
is true. However, I prefer to stick to the immature argument that I
didn't have to pay attention to what she was telling me because I
thought I was being punished. It's really simple. I pay her back for
punishing me by not listening to her. I don't know why anyone would
insist on calling my logic complicated.</p>
<p>"Well that may be true," I have no problem conceding to the points
she brings up, "But it would have made sense."</p>
<p>Barbara looks at me for a very long time then just starts laughing.
It's not a soft demure laugh either; it's a real laugh. She's
laughing at me and I don't really care because I love to see her
smile. She should do it more often. Which is why I'm so exceedingly
happy that she has finally decided to let Wade get a little closer to
her. I know that even though she's the big bad Oracle she still needs
some lovin' too.</p>
<p>"Okay so tell me all about this weekend you've got planned," I
order. "I want all the vital details. You know all the what, when,
where, and how stuff."</p>
<p>Our waitress comes with our food before Barbara gets a chance answer
and we concentrate on our food until I encourage her to speak more
about her eventual weekend getaway.</p>
<p>"So come on now. Tell me what's going on. I need details."</p>
<p>Barbara smiles at me indulgently then carefully sets down her
fork. "What is it you want to know?"</p>
<p>I lean onto the table and can't help the evil smirk that comes across
my face. "Everything," I practically purr.</p>
<p>Barbara actually blushes and I know that it's going to be a fun
night. We'll get dessert, chat about our significant others, then go
and watch over the city by using an intricate system of computer
equipment that tracks everything that goes on. It's going to be a fun
night.</p>
