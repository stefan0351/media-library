<!-- I Can Crack All Your Ribs But I Can't Break Your Heart \ Part 4 -->

<p>The girls' gym was empty. For a brief window of time, from just after the dismissal bell rang until about twenty minutes past three, when the gymnastics team started trickling in for their practice, Brooke could usually count on this giant space to be as private as a confessional. She stood in her glamazon workout gear, leaning against a waist-high stack of practice mats, waiting for her tryst to begin. A moment later the heavy door slammed shut and the rhythmic click of cleats could be heard crossing the polished wood floor.</p>
<p>Josh approached in almost complete uniform; he carried his shoulder pads, and his scrimmage jersey was draped over his t-shirted shoulder. The sight of his dear face made Brooke smile, and he smiled back. It had been about six weeks since that first letter, and they were well and truly together again. It was not like before, when Brooke had been plagued by insecurities and always had half her mind on the image the two of them were presenting. She did not care about that anymore. All that mattered was this beautiful boy coming towards her. He had opened up to her in the only way he could, by sending her the contents of his heart in Times New Roman on cheap copy-paper, and she loved him so much for it.</p>
<p>They never talked about the letters; Josh made it clear in the beginning that they were not to be discussed. She received about two a week, always typed now after the first handwritten one. Although a hand-penned love letter was the standard, Brooke was secretly relieved not to have to stop and decipher Josh's illegible penmanship every few lines.</p>
<p>When Josh reached Brooke he touched her arm and hopped onto the mats, letting his legs dangle. "Hi," he said. "How was your day?"</p>
<p>Brooke wanted a kiss, but Josh did not presume anymore. "Fine. Lots of homework over the break, of course."</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too." Josh ran his hand up and down her back for a moment. "You're still having practice today even though there's no game tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"We have our cheering competition Friday, remember?" Brooke had told him; why couldn't he remember things that were important to her?</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. I can't believe there's no game tomorrow. First time in I don't know how many years there won't be a game on Thanksgiving. We're going to my grandmom's. Be gone until Sunday night."</p>
<p>"You won't be around at all this weekend?" Brooke was bummed, although she didn't know why it mattered; she would be gone the whole time as well. She was leaving early Friday for the competition in San Diego and wouldn't be back until Sunday either.</p>
<p>"Nope," Josh shook his head.</p>
<p>"And I can't even call you. When are you getting a new cell phone?"</p>
<p>"As soon as I make some money to pay for one," Josh had left his phone in his jeans pocket and his mother had sent it through the wash.</p>
<p>"Can I call you at your grandmother's?"</p>
<p>Josh looked pained at the suggestion. "She's kind of weird about the phone bill and stuff."</p>
<p>"Instant messaging?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't have a computer."</p>
<p>"So we're incommunicado until Monday?"</p>
<p>"Looks like it."</p>
<p>"Will you write me a letter?" Brooke asked coyly, wrapping her arms around one of his.</p>
<p>The pained expression again. "Brooke, I thought we weren't going to talk about the letters."</p>
<p>Brooke couldn't understand why Josh refused to discuss his ardent, romantic letters with her. She knew he was both modest and shy, but to hide this remarkable talent under a bushel was such a shame. She supposed his fervent declarations were not very macho, and directly opposed to the jock image he successfully cultivated. It bothered her that he was happy to be perceived as stupid when he so obviously wasn't. "I know, but I can't help it. I just love them so much, and love knowing what you really think, and I want to be with you all the time."</p>
<p>"I'm glad. I want to be with you too," Josh looked into her eyes. "Can I kiss you?"</p>
<p>"Yes please," Brooke smiled. She lifted herself onto the practice mats and faced Josh. Their lips met in a tender kiss, a little more than chaste, but without much urgency. Nice and comfortable, Brooke thought, a cozy comfortable kiss. The kind of kiss I could spend the rest of my life with, she assured herself. Ever since that time in the library, Josh had been very solicitous of her feelings, not allowing himself to go too far. Brooke appreciated that.</p>
<p>When they separated, Josh lay back against the mats and stared at the ceiling. Brooke reclined on her side and supported her head with her hand, studying him. Something had changed in his demeanor and he looked morose. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," he replied in a monotone. Josh wanted nothing more than to make Brooke happy. And what made her happy was receiving the letters that he had been forced to continue accepting from Sam. He wanted to be the kind of guy who could write that kind of letter, to fashion a beautiful sentence that would explain how he felt about her, and know that the appreciative expression in her eyes was earned. He wasn't that kind of guy, but Brooke obviously loved them, and he wound up feeling guilty as hell. What could he do?</p>
<p>Brooke mistook his glumness for something altogether different. "Maybe one of these days we could both ditch practice after school and go somewhere to be alone. Would you like that?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I always want to be alone with you."</p>
<p>His genial response confused her. Wasn't he being moody because she wasn't putting out? She knew he was thinking about it; his letters skirted the issue but it was there, between the lines. And even though they hadn't been back together for very long, she wanted to be more intimate with him. Perhaps then they could be as close as she felt she was to him when she was reading his letters. "I was thinking about a different kind of alone. The kind that involves a hotel room, candlelight and a big bed," Brooke looked meaningfully at Josh.</p>
<p>Josh sat up on his elbows. "Really? You really want to?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said simply, enjoying the sight of his dawning pleased expression. "Why don't we do it next week, after Thanksgiving and the competition, and after you come back from your grandmother's?"</p>
<p>"I think that's the best idea I've ever heard," Josh grinned.</p>
<p>"Good." Brooke leaned in and gave him a quick kiss. "I have to go; we're not practicing tomorrow so today's is going to be extra long."</p>
<p>"Okay. Will I see you before I leave tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Call me tonight if your practice finishes before ours," Brooke said collecting her gear and heading for the door. "Or you can always write me a letter," she added, over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Josh laughed uncomfortably. "Maybe I will," he replied, knowing he would not.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Happy Thanksgiving," Sam simultaneously knocked and pushed on the ajar door to Brooke's room. The sight of Brooke sitting on her bed reading one of her letters made Sam's heart leap a little.</p>
<p>"Hey, Happy Thanksgiving," returned Brooke, folding the letter and tucking it into a book. She stood up and faced her housemate, waiting for her to state her business. When she didn't, Brooke prompted her, "Did you want something?"</p>
<p>"My mother wanted me to ask if you wouldn't mind helping out with some of the dinner preparations. She's got the turkey in the oven but I guess that's just the tip of the iceberg," Sam said wryly. "Don't worry; I'm not getting out of it either. We'll both be slaves for the day."</p>
<p>Brooke looked at the clock on her night table. It was ten in the morning and they weren't eating until five. Were there really seven hours worth of kitchen tasks to accomplish? "I was just going to start packing for tomorrow. Can I come down in, like, an hour?"</p>
<p>"Sure, whatever," Sam replied nonchalantly. "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>Brooke sighed at Sam's nosiness, but answered politely. She should at least try to keep the peace on national holidays - for her father's sake. "I have a cheering competition in San Diego. I'll be gone until Sunday night."</p>
<p>The snarky comment she was expecting from Sam didn't come. In fact, there had been a distinct dearth of snark coming from the McPherson camp lately; she wondered why Sam was falling down on the job. Lack of inspiration, maybe?</p>
<p>"Oh. Good luck with that. See you later," was Sam's simple reply, and then she left.</p>
<p>Several hours later, after Brooke had procrastinated helping in the kitchen as long as possible, she went downstairs to find Jane putting on her coat.</p>
<p>"Oh good, Brooke, Sam could use some help," Jane reached for her purse as she imparted her instructions. "There's a list of things to do on the counter, if you wouldn't mind pitching in. I just have to run to the store and pick up a few more things. I shouldn't have left the shopping to your father. He bought canned cranberry sauce! Is that what you usually have on Thanksgiving?"</p>
<p>"Um, we usually just go out," Brooke said.</p>
<p>'Well, not this year. See you in a little while." Jane was out the door a minute later.</p>
<p>Brooke continued into the kitchen to find Sam at the newspaper-protected kitchen table, engaged in the process of separating a large number of potatoes from their skins.</p>
<p>She waved her potato peeler in greeting. "I hope you like mashed potatoes; we're going to have massive amounts of leftovers."</p>
<p>"What should I do?" Brooke asked, a bit uncomfortable with the prospect of being alone with Sam while Jane was out.</p>
<p>"Why don't you grab another peeler? I still have about," Sam gauged the quantity of potatoes that remained in front of her, "three pounds to go."</p>
<p>Brooke settled herself at the table and picked up a potato. She watched as Sam attacked the one she was holding, flicking at it rapidly with her peeler, sending brown bits of peel in all directions. Approaching the task with less frenzy, Brooke carefully and slowly worked the peeler, coaxing long and curly strands from the outer layer of the potato. They worked in silence, neither knowing how to initiate a civil conversation.</p>
<p>Sam observed Brooke covertly as they worked. She tried to analyze just what it was about Brooke that had captured her heart so thoroughly. Of course, Brooke was beautiful, but Sam thought her beauty was something incidental, a physical manifestation of her goodness. Sam saw how Brooke treated everyone else in the world except for her. Even to the lowliest and most socially-unconnected of her classmates, Brooke was polite and considerate. Parents loved her; she was respectful without being obsequious. It was only Sam whom she treated with anything less than decorum, a fact for which Sam - if she were honest with herself - could not fault her. Did she want to emulate that goodness or merely bask in its glow? She didn't know the answer to that question, only certain that she wanted some of that goodness to flow in her direction.</p>
<p>Distracted as she was, Sam didn't notice that Brooke had been making her own appraisal of her housemate. Brooke thought Sam slightly goofy as she sat with her legs wrapped around the rungs of her chair, hair done up in a loose, lopsided bun on the side of her head, tip of tongue slightly protruding from between her lips in concentration as she assaulted the potatoes. Once she was finished peeling, she carelessly dropped each one into a pot of cool water, usually splashing herself in the process. Where was the fearsome opponent she had come to regard with knee-jerk distrust?</p>
<p>There had been times since their forced cohabitation had begun when Brooke had absolutely loathed Sam, and then times when she had felt sorry for her. Once she remembered briefly feeling admiration for her, when she had done some selfless thing that Brooke would never have considered doing, but then Sam would commit the inevitable foul deed that would earn Brooke's suspicion again. After all the back and forth and up and down, Brooke could not manage the upheaval of reforming her opinion of Sam every few days; instead she now adopted a habitual, composed indifference - and that generally worked - except for the times when she had to swing back towards antipathy for one of Sam's malicious stunts against her.</p>
<p>Still, Sam seemed vulnerable right now; for once the girl had dropped the arrogant, blustery swagger she normally assumed. Perhaps, Brooke mused, Sam suffered from multiple personality disorder, and the dominant persona, that particularly aggravating one that so easily got under Brooke's skin, got the day off on national holidays. The absurdity of that notion struck Brooke as funny, and she smirked to herself. Sam, however, was busy counting the remaining potatoes and missed it.</p>
<p>Racking her brain for something clever to say had produced nothing for Sam except the beginnings of a headache. For reasons unknown to her, she picked up a large potato and pressed it against her forehead, then pushed it against her nose, enjoying the gritty cool feeling of dirt and earth on her face as she smushed it right against the tip, flattening it down to the cartilage. Realizing how strange she must appear, trying to merge her face with a potato, she didn't have to look to know that Brooke was regarding her with curiosity and perhaps concern for her sanity. Without removing the potato, Sam cut her eyes over to Brooke's and casually commented in a nasal voice, "I'm considering rhinoplasty. What do you think?"</p>
<p>Brooke looked surprised for half a beat, then she broke into loud guffaws, dropping her own peeler and half-naked spud onto the table helplessly as the mirth took hold. For some reason, she found Sam and her potato nose hilarious. She gurgled with laughter and pointed at Sam, even though Sam had lowered her potato-prosthetic. Sam was giggling and grinning at her accomplishment, which while not the suave witticism she had planned, had satisfactorily broken the ice. More than that, it was one of those rare moments of exquisite silliness that can reduce two people to simpering heaps. For the next ten minutes all they had to do was glance at each other and another wave of gleeful cackling commenced.</p>
<p>When Brooke had regained the power of speech, she said, "Miss Potato-head, charmed I'm sure," which unsurprisingly sent them back into paroxysms of giggles.</p>
<p>After their laughter died down and they were sufficiently relaxed, abdominals aching from the workout, Brooke caught Sam's eye. "You have some dirt just there," she reached out and Sam leaned in as Brooke brushed at her forehead.</p>
<p>Sam gloried in the contact, reluctantly pulling back after Brooke returned to her half-exposed potato.</p>
<p>"That really was funny, Sam," Brooke said. "I didn't know you had such a good sense of humor."</p>
<p>Sam thought about that for a minute. "Neither did I," she confessed. "I'm not normally known for bringing the funny." She didn't really think what she had done was all that funny; it was just a weird coincidence that they had both been so amused.</p>
<p>"You hide it pretty well, at least when I'm around," Brooke said. "Too busy cataloguing the injustices of the world, maybe."</p>
<p>Sam acknowledged Brooke's diplomatic way of calling her humorless with a nod of her head. Why argue with the truth? She guessed she really did need to lighten up. "My dad was a total cornball, always making jokes and cracking people up, my mom most of all. Maybe it's a latent trait that will develop."</p>
<p>"Do you take after your father in other ways?" Brooke asked, regarding Sam speculatively.</p>
<p>"Well, obviously, there's the journalism thing."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but do you think you began to write because he did? Or would you have been a writer even if you had never known that your father was?" Brooke had been thinking about some things lately that paralleled her question to Sam; it was what made her interested in Sam's answer.</p>
<p>"I do feel like it's more natural for me to write words down instead of saying them," Sam replied. "I get a lot more nervous just talking to someone, and do a lot more self-censoring. I feel freer to write what I truly think when there is that separation between me and the person I'm communicating with." Sam soberly gazed at Brooke. "Does that make sense?"</p>
<p>"I think it answers my question. Writing must be in your genes."</p>
<p>"If I couldn't write it would be like losing one of my senses," Sam said, cringing at the dramatic turn of phrase. But she was determined to be honest now, even though so many of her dealings with Brooke were undertaken with the aim to obfuscate. Sam was thrilled to be having such a personal, serious discussion with the object of her affection. Somehow, they had both let their guard down at the same time, like opposing soldiers meeting in no-man's land on Christmas day to share smokes and a chat. For however long it lasted, Sam was determined to keep the conversational peace. "Did you inherit many of the qualities of your parents, do you think?"</p>
<p>"My dad and I are a lot alike, I guess," Brooke said, her eyebrows furrowed. "But I honestly don't know about my mother." She stopped what she was doing and gazed levelly at Sam. "Do you think I'm destined to be like her?"</p>
<p>Sam took her time considering the question, watching Brooke carefully. She didn't know how to answer and didn't want to get it wrong.</p>
<p>"I mean," Brooke elaborated, taking Sam's circumspection for confusion, "do you think it's, like, a predetermined thing? That it's not possible for me to be a good wife and mother because she failed at is so miserably?" With everything that was happening between her and Josh, she needed reassurance that she could do right by him. While Sam was not the ideal person to ask, and perhaps she would regret it later, this fleeting atmosphere of openness allowed her to disregard her natural distrust. Besides, there was no one else to ask. This was not a question Nicole would ever take seriously.</p>
<p>"I think what your mom did was make a choice," Sam said gently. "Her choices don't pass down to you genetically. She is responsible for the things she has done, and you are responsible for the things you do. Because you have witnessed the damage her actions have done, I would think you are even less likely to behave the way she did."</p>
<p>"Really?" Brooke asked, looking at Sam with relief, and watched her nod emphatically. She thought she owed Sam some explanation for the heavy turn the conversation had taken. "You know that Josh and I are back together, right?"</p>
<p>Sam nodded hesitantly, not wanting to devote even one word of this precious conversation to the subject of Josh.</p>
<p>"I would just hate to think that I was going into a situation with the odds stacked against me, you know? Because it's not just me I have to think about, Josh deserves someone who can be the best wife and mother she can be."</p>
<p>"Whoa, wait. You're getting married?" Sam was incredulous.</p>
<p>"Not right away!" Brooke laughed. "But eventually, yeah."</p>
<p>"But how do you even know that he's the right one?" Sam asked, thinking it a valid question despite her intensely vested interest.</p>
<p>"Ever since we got back together it's been so different than it was before," Brooke gushed. "He's the same in many ways, but he's also showing me this other side, this mature, loving, romantic, private side. It's amazing!"</p>
<p>"Wow. That was almost like a cheer. Put your pom-poms down, Miss Cheerleader, we're just talking here." Sam said.</p>
<p>But Brooke had warmed to her subject. "He deserves his own cheer! Sam, you would not believe how different he is underneath the jock exterior. He is the most beautiful person. So warm-hearted and generous and kind -- and the soul of a poet. He's smart too; you know that after tutoring him. He probably just needed you to help him focus, because I know for a fact that he is brilliant. He sends me these incredible, miraculous letters. And handsome," Brooke chattered away. "With those gorgeous blue eyes and broad shoulders, his children are going to be adorable!"</p>
<p>"He sounds perfect," Sam said dejectedly, realizing that Brooke had fallen in love with her brain and Josh's body: the recipe for the ideal man. The tangle of implications her secret communications to Brooke caused was beginning to hit home, but Sam couldn't' stop to think about them as Brooke continued.</p>
<p>"You know how people think women shouldn't be just stay-at-home moms and homemakers any more? I think that's a lot of crap. What could be more fulfilling than devoting your life to taking care of your husband and raising his children? It's the ultimate expression of love, don't you think?" Brooke dreamily asked.</p>
<p>"No, I don't think," Sam answered, a bit annoyed. "You are totally intelligent, Brooke. Why in the world would you want to waste your brain being a Stepford wife?"</p>
<p>"I don't expect you to understand, Sam. We all know who the go-getter is in this family. It's not what I want. I would be perfectly content in the cute little house with the white picket fence, loving wife and mother, raising 2.4 children."</p>
<p>Sam wrestled with the impulse to continue arguing with Brooke, then decided to let it go in favor of keeping this newfound peace. "If that's what you want then I hope you get it," she said sincerely, feeling guilty that Brooke's perfect image of Josh didn't quite match up with his reality.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke appreciated Sam's support, unlikely though it seemed. She collected a new potato and began peeling. A thought suddenly occurred to her. Josh might expect her to make Thanksgiving dinner one day, here was a perfect learning opportunity. "So what do we do once we've peeled all these potatoes?"</p>
<p>Although a lingering sense of dismay at the largeness of the monster she had created remained, Sam was glad to move on to a topic that didn't involve navigating layers of subterfuge. "We boil 'em until you can stick a fork through them. Then mash 'em up with lots of butter and cream and salt and pepper," she replied. "But we still have..." she reached over and plucked her mother's list from the counter, "... a casserole and the stuffing to make, not to mention dessert."</p>
<p>Just then Jane returned, walking into the kitchen with a bag from the grocery store, and surveyed the scene. She immediately began to marshal her forces. "Hi girls. The potatoes are almost finished? The store was still crazy with people buying last minute things for dinner." She looked into a pot on the stove. "Sam, would you add some more water to the giblets? And Brooke, do you want to make the cranberry sauce?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Jane. Will you teach me? I probably should know how to do it," Brooke jumped up to help with the groceries.</p>
<p>Jane was surprised at Brooke's change of heart. She thought the girl had been exhibiting signs of reluctance when she left. But she welcomed the help. "Sure, Brooke." Jane looked to where Sam was finishing the last potato. It was more familiar for Jane to order her daughter around. "Then Sam, after the giblets, you want to start chopping celery and onions for the stuffing?"</p>
<p>"Okay," Sam obliged. She was a little sorry that the dynamic in the kitchen had changed, but was relieved too. Her conversation with Brooke had given her much food for thought, but at that moment all she wanted was to not think about anything except the mindless instructions on a recipe card. But while she was not thinking, she could enjoy the view of a happy Brooke moving about the kitchen, and tell herself that she was partly responsible for that happiness.</p>
