<!-- The Closet \ Part Twenty-Two -->

<p>"You look tired," Nicole commented with a grin as Brooke slumped down  into the seat next to her.  Harrison had taken over her seat next to  Sam; apparently the sheet of paper he was waving in her face was of  the utmost importance so she decided to steal his seat.</p>

<p>"Don't start with me," Brooke responded turning to face Nicole,  though the smile on her face took away any sting her words may have  had.  </p>

<p>"Is she any good?" Nicole asked looking at Brooke intently.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know," Brooke responded.  "THAT'S not why I'm tired," she  continued shooting her friend a look.  "I've never walked so much  continuously in my entire life.  My feet are bleeding; my feet have  to be bleeding.  This is too much, I mean my god, I'm from L.A. not  Wisconsin or something."</p>

<p>"So you haven't…" Nicole asked her voice incredulous.  After what she  had seen the night before, the idea that the two of them had somehow  managed to control themselves in the past was unimaginable to her.</p>

<p>"No."  </p>

<p>"Would you tell if you had?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Didn't think so," Nicole said looking towards the front of the bus  as the engine started up.</p>

<p>"Lady's never kiss and tell," Brooke responded.</p>

<p>"I always tell."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Brooke replied with a grin, thinking she had just called  checkmate.</p>

<p>"So, is she any good?" Nicole responded seeing the self satisfied  look on Brooke's face and knowing that it wouldn't be there for long.</p>

<p>"I just said…"</p>

<p>"I know," Nicole said interrupting.  "But I don't know any lady's who  would be caught dead doing what you were last night … so dish."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to tell," Brooke responded.  "You saw everything,"  she added in a rather militant tone.</p>

<p>"Let me guess, you're so deeply in lurve that you're relationship has  grown so that it's deeper than a physical love," Nicole responded  grinning happily.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Brooke responded.  "Besides, who would say that, that's  the most retarded thing I've ever heard."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, so there's always room for S-A-M-M-Y, huh?" Nicole asked.</p>

<p>"You're going to torture me for the rest of the week because I called  you a peon aren't you?" Brooke asked miserably.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Now I'm going to make some breast jokes, and you better laugh  like you mean it!"</p>

<p>Brooke sighed as Nicole began speaking again.  Why did relationships  have to be such hard work?</p>

<p>"You look really…I don't know, think of something poetic and pretend  that I said it."</p>

<p>Sam looked up from the notes she had spread out in front of her when  she heard the washroom door nosily creak open.  When Brooke had  decided to take a shower after dinner, she had taken out the notes  she had received from Arabian Knight, and for the first time in days  returned her attention to what had gotten her so excited about this  field trip in the first place.  However, as she watched Brooke exit  the washroom, clad only in a white bathrobe with wet, messy hair  silhouetting her face, Sam quickly remembered why she had forgotten  all about her article in the first place.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked looking over at Sam with a slight smile sensing  the girls eyes on her.  "You're not going to accuse me of hogging the  shower again are you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.  No.  I mean wow," Sam breathed out still unable to pull  her eyes off of Brooke.  "You look really, really…I don't know," Sam  said shaking her head and blushing as she realized that she couldn't  think of a word to adequately describe how breathtaking Brooke  looked.  "I can't…why don't you just think of something really poetic  and pretend like I said it."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled at her flustered roommate and walked over to her bed  flopping down on the side not occupied by the notes Sam was gathering  up.  Once horizontal, she reached her arms back placing them under  her head, which in turn caused her robe to inch a up a little,  smiling as she watched Sam become fascinated by the newly revealed  areas of skin.</p>

<p>"It's going to be really hard for you to write that article if you  can't think of any adjectives," Brooke commented drawing Sam's  attention back to her face.</p>

<p>"I know, shame on you," Sam responded her gaze looked on Brooke's  lips for a moment, before she finally gave into her desires and  leaned down pressing her own lips against Brooke's.</p>

<p>"Shame on me?" Brooke asked once their kiss broke.  "What did I do?"</p>

<p>"You're so irresistible that you leave me almost literally  speechless," Sam responded, as her hand slowly crept across Brooke's  robe covered abdomen, before coming to rest on her hip.</p>

<p>"I can't help the fact that I'm sinfully delicious," Brooke  responded, her own eyes fastened on Sam's face as the brunette  watched her hand play across Brooke's mid-section.</p>

<p>"McQueen, deep and delicious," Sam replied smiling, before returning  to her serious contemplation of the shapes her hands were making over  Brooke's robe.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking?" Brooke asked, placing her hand over top of  Sam's watching her carefully.  There was something in the brunette's  gaze that eluded her, but was also exciting her.</p>

<p>"That," Sam said pausing so that she could look up into Brooke's  eyes.  "That I'd like to see what's under this," she continued, her  fingers idly tracing the tie of the robe.</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, and then lifted up her hand so that  it came to rest on the side of Sam's face.  Then, propping herself up  on her other hand, she leaned forward bringing their lips together,  softly at first then with increasing intensity as she felt Sam's  hands begin to work the tie of her robe.</p>

<p>As Sam's hand slipped inside of her robe, Brooke's arm gave way and  she fell back against the bed, Sam easily rolling on top of her,  their lips only separating when Sam rose up to watch her actions once  she had settled herself on top of Brooke.  </p>

<p>Brooke watched Sam's face, her lips were slightly parted and her eyes  hooded, as her thumb stroked Brooke's stomach lightly.  Brooke felt  her breath start to come in quicken and her heart flutter as Sam  slipped her other hand inside of the robe.  The blonde felt herself  shiver as she realized what Sam was about to do, and then the  brunette fulfilled her prophecy.  Slowly, Sam slid her hands up  Brooke's torso, the robe spreading apart in the wake of her hands.  </p>

<p>Sam was still for a moment once she had revealed Brooke's nude torso  to her hungry eyes, then she leaned forward bringing their lips  crashing against each others once again passionately, as she placed  her hand on Brooke's bare breast for the first time, swallowing the  blonde's groan hungrily.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked softly as the need for oxygen finally forced them  apart.  Her heart was beating so fast she was sure it was going to  break free of her chest.  She felt as if she were on fire, she felt  like she was suffocating and Brooke's skin was air.  She needed…she  needed…</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke whispered, her own body shivering with  anticipation.  Sam had stilled her hand when she spoke, but it made  no difference to Brooke's body, Sam had merely removed the cause, not  the symptoms.  "I want…I'm ready," she continued bringing one of her  hands up to rest over top of Sam's, using it to make Sam's hand  squeeze her breast once more.</p>

<p>Sam was silent for a moment, her attention focused on her hand, which  had started to massage Brooke's breast once more, then she smiled and  leaned forward bringing their lips together once more.  And, as she  felt Brooke's hands begin to slide under her own shirt, she thought  to herself, so this is what love is.  </p>
