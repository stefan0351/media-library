<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 26: The Ladies Of The Evening -->

<p>The horses were groomed and fed with the remainder of the oats in
		Phoenix's saddlebag while Rebecca and the other women washed up at the brook. Only Stacey
		and Josie remained behind. The prostitute tied her red hair up into a bun and pinned it
		into place to keep it off her neck in the heat of the late day sun. Josie leaned back
		against the wagon wheel her black hat pulled down far enough to block Stacey's view of her
		ice blue eyes. For the longest time, not one word had passed between them as the
		gunslinger methodically cleaned her weapons while the prostitute watched. It was Josie who
		finally broke the silence. "Something you find interesting about me?" she asked,
		her eyes never leaving her task.</p>

		<p>"Actually there is."</p>

		<p>"Yeah?" she asked with no sound of interest in her
		voice.</p>

		<p>"Why would someone like you try to help someone like
		us?" the redhead asked, her tone indicating her fear as well as her feelings about
		the woman with all the guns that she assumed to be a common murderer.</p>

		<p>Josie looked up, her blue eyes locking with the green across from
		her. "You mean a thieving, murdering pile of dung like me?" she said in mock
		distaste. The green eyes dropped immediately, guilty that her feelings were so obvious.
		Josie looked back down at her gun, spinning the barrel before snapping it shut and looking
		down the sight. She returned it to her holster and removed the other one before
		continuing. "I don't like to see women punished by the very men that put them in that
		position." In a lower voice she asked, "How many of the men in that crowd were
		regular customers?"</p>

		<p>"More than I'd care to admit," Stacey replied. Her gaze
		drifted off to the clouds as her mind traveled back to a simpler time. "After my
		husband died, I didn't..."</p>

		<p>"You don't owe me an explanation," Josie interrupted as
		she rose in one fluid motion. "I'd better go check on the others." She pulled
		the gun out of her left holster and held it out, butt first, toward the whore. "You
		know how?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," the redhead replied, rising to her feet and
		taking the offered weapon. The gunslinger nodded and walked off in search of the rest of
		the group.</p>

		<p>Two women were sunning themselves on the flat of a large rock.
		Their clothes were scattered nearby. Even in the distance, Josie was able to pick out the
		telltale criss-cross marks of repeated whippings on the back of one of the women. The
		black hair wasn't long enough to cover the red lines of a recent beating. Unable to look
		any longer, the gunslinger turned her attention to finding Rebecca. It took only a moment
		to spot the familiar blonde hair bobbing around, laughing and splashing with two of the
		younger women. The others were milling about in the water, enjoying the freedom of being
		naked without being pawed at. Josie called out, getting her attention. The women started
		getting out of the water, all naked save for Rebecca, who retained her thin cotton slip.
		The gunslinger smiled slightly at the young woman's modesty as she watched her gather her
		clothes and move behind the large rock to change. The others simply stood in the open and
		helped each other get dressed. Josie leaned back against a nearby tree and waited. She
		kept one eye on the rock that Rebecca was behind and the other on the naked bodies
		prancing about in front of her.</p>

		<p>Josie discovered that Elaine, the woman with the whip marks, was
		an excellent shot and the two of them set out to catch enough meat for dinner. In less
		than two hours, they had caught plenty of jackrabbits to feed the group. Neither spoke a
		single word during the hunt, but both learned much about the other. Elaine remained
		focused on her task, refusing to allow herself to be distracted by the distant sounds of
		the coyotes or fooled by the wind rustling the leaves of the brush. Josie understood this
		woman's determination to succeed in securing dinner for her friends. Elaine was clearly
		the one they turned to for guidance and protection.</p>

		<p>They were walking back toward the camp, each carrying three
		skinned and cleaned rabbits. The evening sun had set, the orange now only a slit on the
		horizon, the sky a dark gray, providing just enough light to see the camp clearly in the
		distance. "I could have caught enough for us by myself," Elaine said, her hazel
		eyes staring forward. "I didn't ask you to help."</p>

		<p>"Didn't matter; I had to catch food for us anyway,"
		Josie shrugged, not bothering to look at her.</p>

		<p>"That Rebecca is quite the child."</p>

		<p>"Meaning?" The gunslinger felt herself tense up, unsure
		of what the whore meant.</p>

		<p>"Just that she is naive. She knows nothing of the world
		around her, yet she rides with you, a woman with a price on her head." Elaine held
		her hands up in a defensive position when the gunslinger stopped suddenly and turned to
		face her. "Don't take much to figure out you're wanted for something. Innocent people
		don't run around with that many guns."</p>

		<p>Josie started walking again and the black headed woman fell into
		step. The bounty hunter's eyes stared straight ahead. "What I can't figure out is why
		you let that girl ride around with you. All you're going to do is get her an early meeting
		with Saint Peter."</p>

		<p>"Would you rather she became a whore like you?" the
		gunslinger said with a sneer.</p>

		<p>Elaine stopped and faced Josie. Her fingers dug into the
		carcasses as she fought to control her anger. "I guess that'd be a far sight better
		than being a murderer."</p>

		<p>"Perhaps," Josie replied, her voice betraying none of
		her feelings. "But be either long enough and it makes no difference." She turned
		and started walking again, not waiting for a response.</p>

		<p>The sun was low in the sky when they returned to camp. Josie
		deposited the dead animals near the fire and pulled Rebecca aside. "I have to go get
		the wagon."</p>

		<p>"Now?" she asked, looking at the sky. "Josie, it's
		almost dark. Can't we go get it in the morning?"</p>

		<p>"No. Stay here with them. I'll leave you the shotgun for
		protection."</p>

		<p>"How long will you be gone?" she asked. The gunslinger
		caught the tinge of fear in her young friend's voice.</p>

		<p>"I should be back by midnight." At her surprised look,
		Josie added, "I have to take the long way around the town coming back with the
		wagon."</p>

		<p>"Josie?" Rebecca's``` green eyes locked with those of
		the gunslinger. "Promise you'll be careful?" she asked, concerned. The bounty
		hunter looked at her for a moment before answering.</p>

		<p>"I promise, Rebecca. You try to stay out of trouble."</p>

		<p>"Me?" she asked, feigning innocence. Josie arched an
		eyebrow before grinning with her friend. The mirth ended a moment later when the
		gunslinger whistled for Phoenix. She mounted the steed and with one backward glance, she
		took off to retrieve their belongings. Rebecca stood there and watched until Josie was no
		longer in sight before turning around and joining the rest of the women.</p>

		<p>The aroma of roasting jackrabbit filled the air as the women
		circled around the fire and settled in for the evening. Victoria, the brown headed woman
		who was the last one rescued from the saloon, reached under the seat of the wagon and
		pulled out several bottles of whiskey and rum.</p>

		<p>"Victoria!" Stacey exclaimed as she rose and took one
		of the bottles out of the younger woman's hands. "When did you hide these in
		there?"</p>

		<p>"I been hidin' 'em there for a few months now. I take one
		every week or so. Nobody seemed to notice." Victoria looked over at Rebecca and
		added, "I got a few bottles of sarsaparilla too, if ya want."</p>

		<p>Rebecca hopped up and moved over to the opposite side of the
		fire, joining Victoria next to the wagon. They were born only months apart, and the
		proximity in age helped to make them fast friends. Within minutes, bottles were passed
		around along with pieces of cooked meat, skewered on sticks. Elaine and Stacey dumped part
		of a bottle of sarsaparilla out and replaced it with rum before passing it to Rebecca. The
		young woman gratefully accepted the bottle and drank deeply. The sarsaparilla tasted a bit
		odd to her, but Rebecca was determined to be polite and took another sip and smiled.</p>

		<p>As the evening wore on, Rebecca found that she liked the taste of
		the soda more and more. Victoria giggled slightly when she turned her head and saw Stacey
		pouring out over half of the remaining bottle of sarsaparilla and refilling it with the
		rum. One look at her new friend's green eyes in the firelight told her just how drunk she
		was.</p>

		<p>"Give it a try, Rebecca," Victoria urged, nudging the
		blonde woman with the half-empty bottle of rum. While they all had a turn with the bottle,
		the majority of the missing liquor was used to spike Rebecca's drinks.</p>

		<p>"Oookay, but only a slip," she replied, seemingly
		unaware that her speech was slurred slightly. All she knew was that she was feeling good
		and everything seemed funny to her. The others realized this as well and began to pepper
		her with jokes that no respectable woman would dare repeat, sending the young woman into
		fits of giggles. The soft laughter reached Josie's ears as she returned to camp with
		Flossy and the wagon. She looked up and saw Rebecca surrounded by the women she'd rescued,
		all laughing and giggling. Although she couldn't see her friend, Josie did see the almost
		empty bottle being passed around. She had no doubt that Rebecca was drunk. The gunslinger
		took a deep breath before walking over to them.</p>

		<p>"Where ya going?" Stacey asked the slightly swaying
		Victoria, who had a firm grip on Rebecca's shoulder to keep herself from falling.</p>

		<p>"I gotta pee," she said, her eyes closing for a moment
		as she fought to keep her balance.</p>

		<p>"Ooh, me too," Rebecca said as she got to her feet a
		little too quickly and lost her balance. She unceremoniously flopped back down to the
		ground, taking Victoria woman with her, a feat that she found incredibly funny. The crowd
		of drunken prostitutes around her parted as the imposing gunslinger made her way through.
		Rebecca looked up, her head feeling twice as heavy as normal, to a not-so-happy pair of
		piercing blue eyes. "Uh...hi Josie," she said before breaking out into another
		giggle fit. Nervous looks were exchanged between the other women as they realized just who
		it was that had rescued them from the saloon, but their sense of fear was eased when they
		saw her squat in front of the drunken blonde and scoop her up gently into her arms.</p>

		<p>"You're drunk," Josie said as she carried her friend
		off to a private area in the nearby brush.</p>

		<p>"Am I?" Rebecca asked in all seriousness. She looked
		around and realized for the first time that she was being carried. "Oh...guess I
		am," she said softly before breaking into giggles again. Her sides hurt from the
		constant laughter. Josie smiled softly.</p>

		<p>"You are. Here we go. I'm going to stand you up now; don't
		fall," she said as she set Rebecca's feet down on the ground. The drunken woman
		wavered for a moment before gripping the gunslinger's upper arm for support. The laughter
		ceased as a new feeling washed over her.</p>

		<p>"Josie, I don't feel good."</p>

		<p>The gunslinger watched the sudden change and recognized it for
		what it was. Without wasting time, she got Rebecca down on her knees and held her hair out
		of her face as the contents of her stomach churned out onto the ground. Josie was aware of
		the small crowd forming behind her. "How much did you give her?" she demanded.</p>

		<p>"Enough," Elaine said.</p>

		<p>"Too much," Stacey corrected with a touch of regret,
		noting the continued nausea that gripped the blonde woman. Josie shook her head in
		annoyance at their reckless actions as she continued to care for Rebecca. She leaned in
		closer and softened the tone of her voice. "You feel better, sprite?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded, but a moment later lurched forward for another
		round. The other women discretely left Josie to care for her friend.</p>

		<p>Rebecca woke in the middle of the night to find a cool cloth on
		her forehead and a concerned Josie sitting next to her. "How ya feeling?"</p>

		<p>"Awful."</p>

		<p>"You should. From what I gather, you drank quite a bit
		tonight." She sighed at the thought of the hangover that would visit her young friend
		in the morning. The green eyes closed once more and Josie allowed herself to relax and lay
		down on her blanket, keeping herself a mere arm's length away from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>Elaine watched the scene from her side of the fire. Although she
		couldn't hear the words exchanged, she knew how long the tall woman had been awake,
		watching over her friend. She remembered the conversation she had with the reclusive
		gunslinger earlier in the day. She never would have suspected the woman in black to be so
		understanding and compassionate toward someone who was simply drunk. Elaine fully expected
		Josie to have yelled at them or worse for getting her friend in such a condition. Yet she
		said not a word to them when she returned to the camp. All she did was help Rebecca into
		her blankets and sit next to her. No one dared to disturb them. There wasn't one of them
		that hadn't heard tales of Josie the train robber. They said she killed at will, sometimes
		just for target practice. Elaine looked over at the couple again. She had no doubts that
		Rebecca would be up during the night, nor did she doubt that the gunslinger would be right
		there to lend assistance if needed.</p>
