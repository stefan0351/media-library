<!-- By the Light of the Silvery Moon \ Two Months later - Third night of the full moon -->

<P>The wolf was stomping and growling, hammering at its newest environs, a modified titanium shark cage that Oz had gotten by trading his van to a washed up diver who'd surfaced too fast one too many times. He'd done all the modifications himself, reinforcing it to make sure it would hold his ex-girlfriend's alternate form,&nbsp; installing an electronic lock, then setting the bars on the bottom into a newly poured concrete floor in Giles' basement. Then he'd quietly left town, hoping that some of one of the historic libraries or supernatural societies in Europe might be able to help find a cure for Willow.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Buffy suspected he'd also left town because it hurt too much to stand by the wayside and watch the love that had blossomed between herself and her best friend. They had tried to spare him, but there was no way to hide that intensity of emotion, not when they sought each other out at the slightest provocation, touching and holding hands with an automatic naturalness that they could no more cease than they could stop breathing. Anya, with her usual tact, had been the first to notice and made Xander aware of the relationship by seriously asking, "Now that you and Willow are orgasm buddies, have you tried spanking? Xander and I really enjoy it."</P>
<P>Xander had nearly imploded on the spot. Torn between jealousy, arousal, shock and embarrassment, he'd simply sat in his usual seat in the Bronze coughing and gagging as though he'd swallowed his tongue until Anya thumped him heartily on the back and asked if something had gone down the wrong way.</P>
<P>Buffy suspected the ex-demon was wholly unaware that she'd nearly killed her boyfriend.</P>
<P>Later, after Xander had caught his breath and kickstarted his brain, he'd privately confronted Buffy, demanding to know if it was the truth and then quietly threatening to hurt her if she ever did anything to hurt Willow after she'd admitted it was. The Slayer had kindly not pointed out that she could break him into tiny pieces if she was in the mood. After all, it was the thought that counted. They were cool with it now, though Buffy was comfortably certain she didn't want to know anything about Xander's fantasies on the subject. He was&nbsp;a good guy, but he was a guy after all.</P>
<P>As for Giles, Buffy was sure he'd noticed, but in his inimitable way was avoiding seeing. After all, he was the one who'd told her how to lessen the werewolf's rage; Oz was gone, and Anya would never let Xander off his leash long enough for him to be a candidate, which left only one player who could have effected the cure. Still, Giles had firmly refused to take notice, though he carefully never put himself in a position where he might have to. She couldn't blame him. After all, he'd already been stuck finding out far more about their previous sexual experiences than he would have preferred. After all that, she had a funny feeling that even if she tried to tell him outright, he'd simply clamp his hands over his ears and hum loudly.</P>
<P>"Just as well," the Slayer decided aloud, then looked up from her book. She sat on a mattress on the floor, cross-legged, a stack of school books on the floor nearby next to the ever-present dart gun. "I'm not sure I'm ready for that much openness in my life." Then she straightened, squaring her shoulders. "Homework," Buffy muttered to remind herself that there were some major books to crack. "Humanities waits for no werewolf." She sighed softly, took a sip from the cup of coffee on the floor near the mattress, then began in again, reading quietly, her soft voice filling the room.</P>
<P>"O! Swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon.<BR>That monthly changes in her circled orb,<BR>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable...."</P>
<P>Her voice was lost in a hearty roar of displeasure that brought her head up from the book. Buffy sighed softly, flashing an indulgent smile at the angry werewolf. She was pretty sure the footstamping was mostly boredom. The wolf tended to start chafing at its limited environs by the third night--particularly toward morning--as though it sensed it was about to be locked away from the world for another month. Despite that, they'd seen nothing of the horrifying rages that had marked the early bouts in three months--not since they'd truly become a couple and figured out their own emotions. Though it still fussed and tried to escape, fiddling with the bars when Buffy didn't find ways to distract it, the efforts seemed to primarily be a way to entertain itself.</P>
<P>Buffy glanced down at her book once again. "Guess the Shakespeare's just not cutting it, huh?" she mused aloud. "Can't say that I blame you. Romeo and Juliet's not exactly what you'd call a real cheerer-upper...and probably the whole moon motif isn't a crowd pleaser right now, either." She flagged the page and tossed it aside, then reached for another book on the stack. "Okay, if that won't do, there's got to be something in here that will get a nice wolfy smile...or at least less growling."</P>
<P>The wolf did a slow pivot, eyeing her like&nbsp;a particularly tasty layer of frosting on a very thick multi-layered cake.</P>
<P>Buffy noted the look with a raised brow. "I wish I knew what you're thinking when you look at me like that," she mused aloud. "I mean, when Will gives me the eye like that, I know what's on <I>her</I> mind, but with you...I can never decide if you think I look <I>really</I> tasty, or if you think I look really <I>tasty</I>."</P>
<P>The werewolf stared at her for a long moment, then let out a low growl.&nbsp;</P>
<P>"And no, I won't let you eat the Slayer just to cheer you up," Buffy chastised and then realized what she'd said and blushed a bright shade of pink. "I...that is--"</P>
<P>The wolf roared, threatening to have a lupine temper tantrum.</P>
<P>"Not a big one for the art of the double entendre, I see," she muttered, wondering at her own embarrassment when there was no one there but the wolf. And even if Willow was there--sort of--well, it wasn't like the joke wasn't appropriate.</P>
<P>The Willow-wolf grabbed the bars, using its massive upper body strength to try and wrench them apart. Much like its human counterpart, it wasn't one to handle boredom well. Thankfully, Willow-person didn't have claws, extra sharp canines, or the strength of ten men, and Willow-wolf didn't have the ability to cast spells, levitate objects, or summon demons, or they would all have been in trouble when things got slow.</P>
<P>"Okay, okay," Buffy soothed and grabbed another text from the stack. "How about we try the Coleridge?" She flipped the heavy volume open to a flagged page, clearing her throat before she began to read.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"It is an ancient Mariner,<BR>And he stoppeth one of three.<BR>`By thy long beard and glittering eye,<BR>Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Slayer's voice dropped low, vibrating gently as she fell into the poetry's vivid meter, rising and falling with the tale of the cursed mariner's life of woe. The comforting warmth of the Slayer's voice seemed to soothe the beast, and it slowly began to calm, watching her with sharp eyes. Occasionally, the creature let out a soft growl, or a low snort, but it settled onto the concrete, heavy haunches drawing up as it sat.</P>
<P>"You like that one, huh?" Buffy murmured at some point.</P>
<P>The beast let out a soft snuffling grunt that almost seemed like a confirmation while Buffy went back to reading the poetic saga.</P>
<P>Morning was almost upon them as she neared the end of the poem. The beast curled onto the cement, quieting as the sun began to rise in the east, and its imprisonment neared the end for another month and it was the Slayer's voice that accompanied it into the unnatural sleep that went with the transformation.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"...He prayeth well, who loveth well<BR>Both man and bird and beast.</P>
<P>He prayeth best, who loveth best<BR>All things both great and small;<BR>For the dear God who loveth us,<BR>he made and loveth all...."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Willow blinked, slowly lifting her head as she instinctively fought to throw off the unnatural daze always left after her transformation.</P>
<p>"Sleeping Beauty wakes," Buffy murmured soothingly.</P>
<p>The hacker rolled into a sitting position, tipping her head up to peer at Buffy where she crouched on top of the cage, peering down through the trap door--Oz had left the original top entry along, figuring that the wolf was least likely to try that mode of exit--and offered a bleary smile. "Well, I guess that's one thing the werewolf has done for me," she muttered as she scooted out of the way so Buffy could drop the jointed metal ladder used to get in an out of the cage down, watching as it unfolded for her use. "I do come out pretty high on the beauty scale when compared to all that hair and claws."</P>
<p>"You're beautiful, Will." The Slayer ignored the ladder to drop into the cage, landing in a crouch next to Willow, the hacker's clothes tucked under one arm. "Compared to anyone." Still crouched, she reached out to stroke her lover's pale cheek.</P>
<p>Willow rolled her eyes, though her smile was pleased. "Yeah, right." Despite the dismissive note to her tone, she let Buffy draw her into a languid kiss, relaxing against the Slayer's body as her lover's scent and feel filled still-inhumanly alert senses. The thing was still in her, and it still frightened her sometimes, but it was calmer now, its bloodlust at least partially satiated along with Willow's regular old fashioned lust-lust. Most of the time she wasn't even aware of it. "Then again..." she exhaled when their lips parted.</P>
<p>Buffy grinned. "Brat." She dropped another kiss on Willow's lips, then thrust the pile of clothes under her arm into her hands. "However, since Giles is probably getting ready to start his morning tea ritual, and will be down to check on us in a few seconds--"</P>
<p>"Clothes are good," the hacker inserted as she grabbed clothes and began yanking them hurriedly.</P>
<p>Buffy shrugged. "Not all the time." She grinned and winked, her look making any number of erotic promises.&nbsp;</P>
<p>"Careful," Willow drawled, her voice low and sultry. She grinned and growled softly, reaching out to catch a handful of the Slayer's blouse in her grip and tug her lover close. "You don't want to arouse the animal in me."&nbsp;</P>
<p>"Wanna make a bet?" Buffy drawled knowingly.</P>
<p>The sound of Giles' step on the stairs brought both of their heads up.</P>
<p>"Later," Buffy mouthed as she stepped back and smoothed her clothes.</P>
<p>And later, they would make love, arousing and taming the animal at the same time, sharing heated caresses and hotter emotions, surrendering to each other in a way that could and would only grow deeper over time....</P>
