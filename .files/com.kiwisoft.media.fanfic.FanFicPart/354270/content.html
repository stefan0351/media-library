<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 24: Storm clouds -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway left the reception, went to her ready room and tried to bury
herself in her work. Three hours later she had completed all of the personnel
reports that weren’t due for two more weeks and she still couldn’t shake the
image of B’Elanna’s hand resting on Seven’s belly. It was obvious that Seven was
completely in love with B’Elanna and utterly devoted to her. Kathryn wasn’t the
sort to waste her time thinking about what could have been, but she also wasn’t
the sort to turn her feelings off like a light switch. Seven had two and a half
years to fall in love with B’Elanna, but Kathryn didn’t have the luxury of time.
She had sent Seven off on a simple away mission, only to have her return a week
later with everything changed. </P>
<P>"This is ridiculous," Kathryn said to the empty room. She took a drink of her
coffee that had cooled hours earlier. It tasted as bitter as she felt. "Okay,
you should just be happy for them," she told herself. She knew she couldn’t
offer half of what B’Elanna had given Seven. Kathryn was married to her ship,
she couldn’t take a crewmember as a lover, and even if she did, she could never
give that lover her whole heart. And the bottom line was, Seven had been through
so much already, she shouldn’t have to settle for anything less than everything.
</P>
<P>Kathryn leaned back in her chair and rubbed her eyes. She was tired, too
tired to sleep. She thought about the way B’Elanna had looked at Seven, her eyes
full of adoration, not a single ounce of doubt, full of complete trust, and
offering her heart and soul, her whole heart and soul, not the meager leftovers
after the <I>USS Voyager</I> had taken her pound of flesh. </P>
<P>She stood and paced, and remembered growing up on the agricultural park; she
remembered her mother. Gretchen Janeway was a good Starfleet wife, she stayed
home, raised the children, never complained, and she waited. She waited for the
day when her husband would put her first, when Starfleet would get enough of
him. That day never came. Kathryn waited too; she waited for the day that she
would see the sorrow and the loneliness leave her mother’s eyes. That day never
came either. Her mother never came first, and Kathryn realized that she would
never wish that existence on Seven. </P>
<P>"Don’t ever put her second, B’Elanna," Kathryn whispered to the empty
room.</P><I>
<P>*"Larson to Captain Janeway."*</I> the bridge officer’s voice echoed over
Kathryn’s comm badge.</P>
<P>"Janeway, here."</P><I>
<P>*"Ma’am…I wouldn’t normally contact you for this, but since you are in your
ready room…"*</P></I>
<P>"Go ahead, Larson." Janeway smiled, wondering if she had ever been that eager
to please. Of course she had.</P><I>
<P>*"Ma’am, I ran some extra scans of our flight path… and long range scanners
are showing some dark matter. I thought you might want to take a look. Maybe we
can harvest some anti matter."*</P></I>
<P>"Thank you, Larson. That’s a good idea. How far out is it?" Janeway stood and
headed to the door. </P><I>
<P>*"Twelve hours, ma’am."*</P></I>
<P>"Good work," she said. It was always a good idea to recognize extra effort,
even if she couldn’t offer her crew the same promotions they could get in the
Alpha Quadrant. "Dark matter can have a nasty gravity well that extends
thousands of light years... Have the helm plot us a course that keeps us out of
range."</P><I>
<P>*"Yes, ma’am."*</P></I>
<P>Janeway walked onto the bridge, nodding at Larson as she went to her command
chair. She might as well log some time with the gamma shift. They didn’t get to
work with her often.</P>
<P>"Let’s see that dark matter," she said as she scanned the data at her comm
station. She frowned. "Helm, alter course to 242 mark 132. We’re already in the
outer current of the gravity well. Let’s stay clear if we can avoid it."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven was not quite awake, she twisted and tried to roll over onto her side
but something blocked her. She opened her eyes and could tell it was still the
night shift, the lighting was lowered, but there was enough light for her to see
that B’Elanna was not beside her, then she heard mumbling. She smiled and lifted
the covers.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was curled around Seven’s body, her cheek pressed to Seven’s waist
while her hand cradled the soft curve of Seven’s belly. B’Elanna was asleep, but
she was nuzzling Seven’s side and mumbling.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered. "Come back up here, darling." She reached down and
guided B’Elanna back up to her pillow.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and then whimpered a very unKlingon sound and smacked her
lips before she crawled onto Seven’s chest and hummed contentedly. Her hand
drifted up and settled over Seven’s heart, B’Elanna’s second favorite location.
Any time the Klingon’s hand wasn’t on Seven’s belly, it was resting over her
heart.</P>
<P>Seven ran her fingers through B’Elanna’s hair. She liked the longer style,
loved to gather it up and tie it off in a ponytail with a piece of leather
lacing and then swish it when the mood struck her.</P>
<P>She smiled in the darkness, then shifted her weight when she felt a twinge in
her side. She reached down and rubbed the offending muscle, then felt B’Elanna’s
hand meet hers on her stomach. The twinge became a dull pain, and she shifted
trying to stop the cramp.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s leg moved over Seven’s thigh; even in her sleep the Klingon like
to cover Seven with as much of her flesh as possible. Her knee slid higher until
it gently nudged Seven’s bladder.</P>
<P>"Ouch," Seven squirmed and pushed B’Elanna leg away and took in a deep
gasp.</P>
<P>"Mmm. Seven?" B’Elanna’s eyes opened, though she was far from awake. "Ya’
okay?" she asked with a yawn as her eyes closed.</P>
<P>"Cramps," Seven responded and kissed B’Elanna’s head. "Go back to sleep."</P>
<P>"Roll over," B’Elanna said as she shifted her weight off of Seven. "Come on,
I’ll have your back relaxed in no time," she said without opening her eyes.
B’Elanna was used to rubbing Seven’s back in the middle of the night. Seven’s
long body seemed prone to cramps that settled in her lower back.</P>
<P>"Not my back," Seven said even as she rolled onto her side, after all,
B’Elanna’s back rubs were the Omega molecule of touch…pure perfection. "Ouch,"
Seven said once she was on her side.</P>
<P>"Where?"</P>
<P>"My stomach, and sides." Seven rubbed her belly, the skin felt tight, and she
was sure she was getting as big as a class two shuttle craft.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna sat up, fully awake. "Computer, lights." The room
brightened, and both women squinted against the bright light. "Why didn’t you
wake me? Should we call the Doctor?"</P>
<P>"No, it is just a cramp," Seven insisted.</P>
<P>"How do you know?" B’Elanna asked. She ran her fingers over Seven’s stomach
and sides. "Where does it hurt?"</P>
<P>Seven rolled her eyes, an affectation she had only recently picked up. "It is
a cramp. It is almost gone." She slid B’Elanna’s hand to the spot where the
cramp had been.</P>
<P>"You sure?" </P>
<P>"Yes, now go back to sleep." Seven settled back down onto her pillow.</P>
<P>"Wake me up if it happens again, okay?" B’Elanna settled down and spooned
Seven from behind, reaching down and pulling the bearskin blanket up around
them.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," Seven said. "Computer, lights out."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tom Paris sat alone at a small table in the mess hall nursing his cup of
coffee. He was also nursing a severe hangover. He had left the reception the
night before and went to Fairhaven, drowning his sorrows in drink and Becca’s
holographic arms. Both cures left him feeling empty.</P>
<P>"Tom, mind if I join you?" Harry asked his friend. He wouldn’t normally ask,
but Tom had chosen a small table well away from the rest of the crew who were
having breakfast.</P>
<P>"Hey, Harry." He nodded at an empty chair.</P>
<P>Harry settled his meal, carefully arranging his utensils and coffee cup, and
then began seasoning his eggs with enough pepper to make them turn battleship
grey.</P>
<P>"Jesus, Harry, how can you eat those?"</P>
<P>"What? They’re good." Harry shrugged and continued his meal. "You left in a
hurry last night," Harry said quietly.</P>
<P>Tom let out a disgusted snort and rolled his eyes. "Why should I stick around
to see that Borg rub my face in it?"</P>
<P>"Tom, they love each other. Maybe if you had stayed last night you would have
seen that." Harry set his fork down, making sure it was centered on his napkin.
He was nothing if not organized.</P>
<P>"Oh, please," Tom said. He emptied his coffee cup in one gulp. "Lana’s gonna’
come to her senses soon, and when she comes crawling back to me… I’m gonna’ make
her beg."</P>
<P>Harry bit his lip, then took a sip of his coffee. He stared at his meal,
suddenly wishing he had sat somewhere else. "Seven’s pregnant," Harry said as he
put down his cup.</P>
<P>"What?" Tom demanded. "She freaks out ‘cause I slept with a hologram, but she
stays with Seven after she screwed some guy?"</P>
<P>Conversation in the mess hall stopped as Tom’s yelling echoed through the
room.</P>
<P>"It’s B’Elanna’s baby," Harry said quietly.</P>
<P>"Come on, Harry. She may be the all mighty Borg, but she’s not that mighty."
Tom was fuming. He had asked B’Elanna about kids and she had said that they
weren’t even ready to get married, let alone talk about kids. She also said that
Tom wasn’t ready to be a father, and he needed to grow up before they could talk
about it.</P>
<P>"It’s true, Tom." Harry looked over at his friend. He knew Tom was having a
rough time, but suspected it was more about ego than a broken heart. "Don’t push
this, Tom. You have no idea what you’re getting into." His dark eyes narrowed as
compassion covered his dark features.</P>
<P>"No," Tom said as he stood. "That Borg bitch doesn’t know what she’s getting
into."</P>
<P>"Tom," Harry stood and grabbed the helmsman’s arm. "Damn it, Tom. It’s over.
Let B’Elanna be happy."</P>
<P>Harry saw the punch coming, but was too shocked to block it or even flinch.
He dropped to one knee and grabbed his jaw. "That could have went better," he
whispered.</P>
<P>"Stay out of this, Harry. It’s none of your business," Tom said as he stalked
out of the mess hall.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway sat at the head of the conference room table and studied her
officers. Tuvok waited patiently for the captain to explain, the Doctor was
reading over a medical data padd that most likely contained his latest opera,
and Harry wasn’t looking at anyone. That was the good news. </P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven, who were both still officially off duty, looked like two
teenagers at their senior prom. They tried to look professional, but the
frequent stolen glances and smiles were more obvious than if they had just
broken down and held hands or offered to carry each others’ notebooks to study
hall. It didn’t help that neither woman was in uniform, having been called to
the meeting during breakfast in their quarters. B’Elanna was wearing black
slacks and a blue-gray tank top, covered by her ever present leather jacket.
Seven was radiant in a pair of cream slacks and matching silk top and she wore
her thick braid hanging over her left shoulder down to her belly. </P>
<P>The remaining two officers were staring at the couple. Neelix had a goofy
grin as he studied Seven. Tom Paris’ expression was unreadable as he watched
B’Elanna, although Janeway suspected it was at the hostile end of the
spectrum.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway began. "We are entering an area pocked with dark matter.
We need to plot a course through the sector that avoids the gravity wells but
doesn’t add two months to our journey. As it is, going through this sector will
take four months because we won’t be able to go to warp. If we go around the
dark matter zone, it will take us six months at maximum warp." She turned to
B’Elanna. "I’m sorry to cut into your leave, but I could really use your input,
B’Elanna. The gravity wells are going to play havoc with the warp engines, so
I’d like you to enhance the forcefields around the critical systems. We may just
take them off line if we have to since the gravity wells make it impossible to
form a static warp field."</P>
<P>"Of course," the Klingon answered. She was figuring out which schematics she
would have to study for the task at hand. She didn’t like being rusty and had
been pouring over all the ship’s technical manuals.</P>
<P>"Seven," the captain said as she turned toward her, "We need the most
accurate charts possible, and you are the best." Kathryn smiled ruefully.</P>
<P>Seven nodded. "I would find the challenge a pleasant diversion. Too much free
time can be… unsettling."</P>
<P>"Tom," the captain said as she gave him her attention, "You’ll need to be on
top of whatever Seven gives you."</P>
<P>Tom rolled his eyes. "I didn’t think giving was in the Borg vocabulary."</P>
<P>"Ensign?" Janeway demanded. "Is there a problem I should be aware of?"
Kathryn kicked herself for her poorly chosen words.</P>
<P>"No problem, ma’am…just a little joke to lighten the mood," Tom said.</P>
<P>"I suggest you leave moral to Neelix." Janeway’s voice left no doubt that she
was furious. She didn’t like Tom acting like a spoiled child, especially when he
dragged his temper tantrums into her staff meetings.</P>
<P>"Understood," Paris said.</P>
<P>"Doctor, does the increased gravity pose any risk to the crew?" Janeway asked
the hologram.</P>
<P>"None, captain. Fortunately, the human body, being made up of mostly good old
fashioned water, is less fragile than B’Elanna’s engines." The Doctor was smug,
as if he were personally responsible for the human form and its advantages over
the ship’s engines. "With the exception of some space sickness, enduring a few
of the gravity wells will not be a problem."</P>
<P>"Space sickness?" Tuvok asked. "Would it not be prudent to avoid all of the
gravity wells?"</P>
<P>"Now, now, Commander," the Doctor said. He added a tisk tisking sound before
continuing. "I’m sure you’ll manage just fine." </P>
<P>"Indeed?" Tuvok wondered if the Doctor would be as glib if his matrix were as
effected as Tuvok was when he got space sickness.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway said, cutting off the useless debate before it could
begin. "Let’s get to work. Harry, I want a class four probe prepared within the
next week. Use the Borg shielding so we can send it into one of the dark matter
clouds and recover some anti-matter. But let’s get our course safely plotted
first." </P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." Harry smiled. He enjoyed special projects and the challenges
they offered.</P>
<P>The group stood and slowly left the table. Tom came around the table and
quickly left. Seven waited for B’Elanna to catch up with her so that they could
walk out together.</P>
<P>"Will you meet me for lunch?" Seven asked coyly. She felt like she was making
her first date. Illogical considering she knew she had B’Elanna’s heart.</P>
<P>"Think Neelix will have anything as good as that stew you used to make for me
when it rained?" B’Elanna had to consciously remind herself to not hold Seven’s
hand. It was not professional, and they didn’t want to start any bad habits.</P>
<P>"Stew?" Neelix asked as he joined them. "Seven, have you been doing more
cooking? I can always use another helper in the mess hall." He smiled, waiting
to see if he had successfully hooked the exdrone.</P>
<P>"Conditions on the planet were harsh," Seven said gravely. "I do not think
the captain would allow cannibalism on board. Plus it would considerably reduce
the crew manifest."</P>
<P>Neelix’s jaw almost hit the floor. He stopped and gapped at her like he was a
fish yanked out of its tank, his mouth opening and closing.</P>
<P>B’Elanna took Seven’s elbow and herded her out of the room. "You are so bad,
Seven," she whispered as they climbed into the turbolift.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Harry Kim entered the Astrometrics lab and cleared his throat. "Ah, Seven?"
He asked.</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim, how may I assist you?" Seven asked without looking up from her
calculations.</P>
<P>"I was wondering if you could help me modulate the Borg shielding for the
probe."</P>
<P>"That project is to be completed after we finish plotting our course through
the dark matter zone." Seven looked up at Harry, her expression chastising.</P>
<P>"Well, yeah," he stuttered. "But there’s nothing more I can do to plot the
course, so I thought I’d get a jump on it."</P>
<P>Seven let him off the hook. "Your initiative is admirable. However, I am
still busy calculating the most efficient flight plan."</P>
<P>"Well, do you need some help?" he offered.</P>
<P>She paused, torn between her preference for working alone and the prospect of
finishing the task sooner.</P>
<P>"That would be...acceptable," she finally said.</P>
<P>"Great," Harry said enthusiastically. "Where should I start?"</P>
<P>Seven smirked, but didn’t let him see it. "I am tracking what appears to be
an ion trail through the sector. It would seem logical that the other ships
traversing this sector would have had similar concerns as <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"Yeah, that’s logical," Harry said, but he doubted he would’ve thought to
check for old ship courses.</P>
<P>"Access the aft sensor information and use it to create a map that overlays
the various gravity wells and the cumulative effects they have on each other,"
she ordered.</P>
<P>"No problem," Harry said. He retrieved the data and began cross referencing
the material as Seven had suggested. It was a time-consuming process.</P>
<P>"So, are you excited?" Harry asked when the silence became bothersome to
him.</P>
<P>"It is a routine action. Plotting a course could hardly be called exciting."
Seven moved from console to console adjusting the sensors to get the latest
results.</P>
<P>"I meant about the baby," Harry said with a disarming smile.</P>
<P>"Oh…" Seven was stymied. Of course she was excited. Why did people insist on
asking questions with obvious answers? She couldn’t understand why crewmembers
continually asked her if she was happy, or excited, or her least favorite,
"don’t you wish the baby was already here?"</P>
<P>"So," Harry asked again, "Is B’Elanna excited?"</P>
<P>"Yes." Seven smiled, and then consciously chose to let her guard down with
Harry. "She can barely wait. I think she is the epitome of ‘the nervous
father.’"</P>
<P>Harry laughed at the image that painted. "Hey," he said he looked down at his
completed data. "Look it this."</P>
<P>"Intriguing," Seven said she studied the way the overlapping gravity wells
interacted. The conflicting gravity made the surrounding space look like a
Labyrinth, but that was not what caught her eye.</P>
<P>"Ensign, check these areas here… here… and here, then see if the increased
gravity of the overlapping fields is stable."</P>
<P>"Okay," he said slowly. "Why?" he asked even as he checked the data. His eyes
widened. "Yes, it is."</P>
<P>"Is there a consistent direction of movement? Is it in the direction we wish
to travel?" she asked as she leaned over the console with him.</P>
<P>"Yes..." he said. "What are you thinking?"</P>
<P>"That we may have found a way to cut several months off of our journey,"
Seven said.</P>
