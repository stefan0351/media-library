<!-- Realms \ Part 16 -->

<p>Faith sat in the waiting room crying, Tara was the first person that
she had actually loved, sure she had liked the others she had dated
in the past but she loved Tara.  </p>

<p>The brunette looked over at her fellow slayer and friend, "It's not
fair B.  She never did anything to hurt anyone, the only reason he
took her was because of me, she's gone and it's my fault," sobbed
Faith.</p>

<p>Buffy placed her hand on the brunettes' shoulder, "Faith listen to
me, it's not your fault, Tara was involved in this before you two
became an item.  The Warlock only said what he did to hurt you," her
voice was filled with compassion for her hurting friend as she looked
Faith in the eyes, "We'll find The Warlock and we'll get Tara back."</p>

<p>"And we'll make him pay," Added Faith as she wiped the tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow sat next to Faith and continued to comfort their
friend as Giles paced back and forth across the waiting room.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart all this pacing isn't going to make the doctors get here
any faster," replied Joyce as she got up and went over to her fiancé.</p>

<p>Giles wrapped her arm around her, "I know, I can't help it, I think
of all of them as my children and…and this is…it's to much, I don't
know what to do," replied Giles, his eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"There's nothing we can do now but wait and see what the doctor has
to say."</p>

<p>"You're right, "sighed Giles, "but what about The Warlock."</p>

<p>"Rupert, you'll think of something, you always do," lovingly replied
Joyce.</p>

<p>"What if I can't," replied Giles his voice laces with doubt, "I've
already let them down once and look what happened."</p>

<p>"Rupert, you didn't let them down, there is no way you could have
know when or how The Warlock would attack," replied Joyce as she
tightly wrapped her arms around Giles.</p>

<p>The two of them stood there comforting one another till a voice
interrupted their moment, "Excuse me you wouldn't happen to be Mr.
Giles would you?"</p>

<p>Giles released Joyce from their embrace and turned to face the young
doctor, "How are they?"</p>

<p>"There stable," replied the doctor pausing for a moment to give the
older couple time to prepare themselves for what he was about to
say, "you might want to have a seat I have several things I need to
tell you about their conditions."</p>

<p>Giles and Joyce held tightly to one another's hand and he placed his
other arm around Faith.  Buffy grabbed a hold of her mom's hand and
wrapped her arms around Willows waste as the red head sat down on her
lap.  Giles looked to at the doctor, "OK, we're ready."</p>

<p>"Right now it's to early to speculate about either one of their
conditions.  The next forty-eight hours are going to be very critical
for both of them.  I will tell you what we do know at this point.
First of all I would like to start with your nieces condition Mr.
Giles."</p>

<p>"OK," replied the watcher, tightening his grip on Joyce's hand.</p>

<p>"She has suffered massive head trauma from the large amounts of
energy her body absorbed…she is currently unconscious, the next
couple of days will tell us what her chances of a full recovery are.
I wish I could tell you more but with that kind of injury it's
difficult to make any determination on her status until we have had
more time for observation.  Do you have any questions?"</p>

<p>"Any idea on what are we looking at with her?" nervously inquired
Giles.</p>

<p>"Like I said before it is still to early to tell.  All I can really
do at this point is give you the best and worst case scenario of what
could possibly happen.  The best-case scenario would of course be a
full recovery…I'm afraid that the worst-case scenario however would
be that she doesn't regain consciousness and lapses into a comma.
Before you start to panic I want to remind you that is the absolute
worst case scenario and we will do everything in our power to prevent
that from happening."</p>

<p>The doctor waited for a moment to allow them to absorb what he has
just said, "Do you need more time or do you wish for me to continue?"</p>

<p>"We'll be OK, what about Xander?"</p>

<p>"Your nephew is conscious, however I'm afraid that most of the damage
appears to be to the spinal cord.  Right now he has no feeling from
the waste down, but has full function of his upper body."</p>

<p>"Is he going to be paralyzed?"</p>

<p>"I simply don't know; it's just to early to tell."</p>

<p>Later that evening. . . .</p>

<p>Joyce nervously looked out the window as the sun began to set over
Sunnydale, she felt helpless, not only where Cordelia and Xander
badly injured but now Rupert, Buffy, Willow, and Faith where on their
way to face the monster who had put their friends in the trauma
center.  Tears rolled down her face as she leaned up against the
windowsill, and whispered a prayer to the Goddess, "please watch over
them and bring them back to me safety." </p>

<p>The group cautiously entered the warehouse that Willows tracking
spell had led them to.  Buffy and Faith were both prepared to attack
as they moved slowly into the main room, scanning it for any sign of
The Warlock or his allies, but found none.  The only one who was in
the room with them was Tara who was tied to a chair in the middle of
the room and gagged.  As Faith rushed to free her love, Buffy
motioned to Willow and Giles that the cost was clear.</p>

<p>Hidden in the shadows of the warehouse Torin the assassin stealthily
moved into position.  His unholy blood rapidly pulsed through his
body as the blonde slayer came into his sights.  The demon slowly
took aim with his ever-faithful blowgun and patiently waited for the
just the right moment to fire.</p>

<p>Faith grabbed the ropes that bound Tara to the chair and tore them in
half, as soon as she did the blonde reached up and yanked the gag
from her mouth, "Get out, it a trap!"</p>

<p>Torin blew into the gun sending the deadly dart towards an
unsuspecting slayer.  A sinister smile spread across his demonic face
as he watched the blonde grab at the dart that was now lodged in her
left shoulder, then collapse.</p>

<p>Willow dropped down to her knees next to Buffy and quickly removed
the dart from her shoulder.  She quickly scanned the area to see a
Grey demon moving quickly towards the door, "No," screamed the red
head as a blue bolt of light soared through the air the retreating
demon.</p>

<p>Torin dropped buckled over in pain as the magical energy scorched his
back.  Turning to face his attacker, Torin howled out in agony.  His
eyes filled with panic as he watched the red headed mages eyes
pulsate with power.</p>

<p>Willows hand began glowing a bright blue light as she pointed towards
the beast that had harmed her beloved, "Die".</p>

<p>A wave of magical energy shot from her hand and rippled through the
air towards the demon, and disintegrated the fowl creature as soon as
it struck.</p>

<p>Willow slowly kneeled down by Buffy's side, she found herself growing
dizzy, everything around her was becoming a blur, looked up at the
others who had rushed over to the fallen blondes side, "Something's
wrong," replied Willow in a weakened voice before collapsing next to
her beloved.</p>

<p>"How sad, the Warrior of Light and her Mage have fallen,"
sarcastically stated Ciarán as he appeared next to the group.</p>

<p>The Warlock looked down at the two young girls who laid motionless on
the grown, "Rupert, it would seem that I have won.  I would stay for
awhile and kill you and your slayer myself, but I have to prepare to
open the Hellmouth, so I'll leave that task to them," replied Ciarán,
pointing to the twenty plus vampires who where emerging on of the
back rooms of the warehouse.</p>

<p>The Warlock turned to Faith and Tara, "See how long you can last
without your friends," he snarled right before vanishing.</p>

<p>Faith and Giles took up fighting positions in-between the oncoming
vampires and Buffy and Willow as Tara quickly worked to put up a
protective shield over them.</p>

<p>The three of them stood there in shock as they watched all of the
advancing vampires burst into flames.</p>

<p>Faith and Giles both turned around to Tara who had just as a confused
look on her face as the others.</p>

<p>"Don't just stand their staring at each other, we have little time,
the poison is already destroying her," replied a voice of to the left
of them.</p>

<p>"Fey, what can we do to help them," inquired Tara as she turned to
meet her long time friend.</p>

<p>"We must rid the slayers blood of the poison it is the only way to
save the two of them."</p>

<p>"What do we need to do?" asked a very panicked Giles.</p>

<p>"There is nothing you can do," replied Fey as she turned to
Faith, "Only one of you can save them."</p>

<p>"Me?" questioned a rather confused slayer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Child…you."</p>
