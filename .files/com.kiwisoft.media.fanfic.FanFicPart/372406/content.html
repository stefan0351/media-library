<P>AN: I'm really really sorry but college and writer's block just don't mix lol. I'm not exactly sure of my direction anymore. I'm kind of just letting my characters tell the story…off the top of my head…it just feels right.</P><P>Chapter 7</P><P>(Beth POV)</P><P>I want her. I want her more and more everyday. I want her so much that it's killing me. I think I'm starting to slip…I don't know how much longer I can pretend. My world has lost it's color and food has lost it's taste. She's my world and she doesn't even know it. I can't do this anymore…I have to tell her.</P><P>(Kate POV)</P><P>Beth's been acting very strange lately but she won't tell me what's wrong. I think she's trying to distance herself from me, physically and emotionally. I'm not going to let it happen…can't she see that the more she pushes me away, the tighter I hold on. I'm so pathetically in love with her that I feel like I'm stuck in some sappy soap opera. I think I'm losing Beth…I should tell her the truth even though it could easily end our friendship. But if I'm going to lose her regardless, I would rather she know the truth.</P><P>(Beth POV)</P><P>I can do this. She's looking at me like she wants to tell me something but I have to get this out before she says anything.</P><P>"Kate, can I ask you something?" Wait, where am I going with this.</P><P>"Yeah. What's up?" She's giving me a curious yet confused look.</P><P>"Um…What would you think if Brooke and Peyton became a couple." What? Where did that come from? Oh well, thank god for One Tree Hill maybe it can help me out with this one.</P><P>She gives me a confused smile, "Actually, I think they'd make a great couple. I mean they're the closest best friends I've ever seen in my life and they understand each other like no one else can. I think Breyton could be the next Naley."</P><P>Wow…didn't expect that one but that's amazing. Kate and I are just like Peyton and Brooke. "I agree. I believe their love is the stuff of legends." Just like ours.</P><P>She's smiling at me and I'm once again captivated. I can't, nor do I want to, stop myself from leaning towards her. She looks shocked but she's not moving away. "Kate, I'm about to do something very stupid so if you don't want me to you better move now."</P><P>She surprises me by moving forward and connecting our lips. It starts off slow and unsure but soon turns passionate. I run my tongue over her bottom lip asking for permission which she quickly grants. A bolt of electricity shoots through both of us as soon as our tongues clash. She moans and it drives me over the edge. Her hands grab onto my hips and she quickly tugs me towards her so I end up straddling her. One of my hands is cradling her face while the other is lost in her blonde curls.</P><P>She breaks the kiss for much needed oxygen but I trail my kisses to her neck. I find her pulse point and start to suck on it. She throws her head back and a throaty moan escapes her mouth. I pull away completely when I feel her hands tracing my stomach. We're both breathing heavily and we rest our heads against one another.</P><P>"Wow." That's all I can say at this point…my brain is absolute mush.</P><P>"Yeah…wow." I don't think her brain is working either.</P><P>"I'm in love with you, Kate Spencer." I said it. I've never been so scared in my entire life.</P><P>She smiles softly, "I'm in love with you too, Beth."</P><P>(Kate POV)</P><P>Holy crap, this is a lot to take in. First, Beth comes in all nervous and asks me about Brooke and Peyton being a couple. That one was out of left field but oh well it all worked out in the end because when I told her that they belong together I was also talking about us. We both know that we are exactly like Brooke and Peyton. Then my dreams came true when she leaned in to kiss me. I was so shocked at first that I didn't know what to do. Then she told me I should move if I didn't want it. Yeah right, that was the only thing I did want so I leaned in the rest of the way and kissed her. The kiss was amazing…the best kiss I've ever had and I couldn't stop myself from moaning a couple times. It got a little out of control which surprisingly, was mainly my fault…oh well.</P><P>When Beth told me she was in love with me, it was the happiest moment of my life. I couldn't stop from smiling before quickly telling her the same. I can't believe that we are actually in love with each other. I wonder how Carrie, Heather, and our parents are gonna take it. Oh well, I don't care. Beth and I are together now, that's all that matters.</P><P>AN: I promise this was real…not a dream   Sorry about the length….short but very juicy lol. I haven't decided if I want to end it in the next chapter or continue on. If I stop it now then there are so many possibilities. I could write a sequel or a whole new fic. Or I could start my Brooke and Peyton one….hmm. What do you guys think? REVIEW Please!</P>
