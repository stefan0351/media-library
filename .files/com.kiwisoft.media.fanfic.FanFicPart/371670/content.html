<p style="text-align:center;"><i><u>What I didn't know</u></i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Chapter 5: My Wish</i></p>
<p>The school day is over for today, and I can honestly say that I never imagined despising such a time like I do at this moment. I'm currently walking that same path I marched this morning, yet there's a little difference. While I was uneasy about encountering Lily earlier, I am anxious about leaving her now.</p>
<p>I can see the small gates that limit my house already, and with each step I take my heart doubles it's jumping; I fear it might hop from my mouth very soon. We finally reach my home and I stop facing directly ahead, Lily does too.</p>
<p>"Hey do you want to go to my house? We don't have much homework today." - She says to me with a small smile I catch from the corner of my eye. But I stay silent. – "Miley?"</p>
<p>Closing my eyes and exhaling a deep sigh, I take the backpack from my shoulders and drop it on the floor before my feet. I open it, and take out her notebook.</p>
<p>"Hey that looks just like one I have." She comments and I almost laugh at her silliness. But I don't. This is not a time for laughter, for what I am about to do can change so much.</p>
<p>I finally decided on how I'm going to give it back. If you haven't noticed how already, I'll be very specific; I'm going to give it to her directly. And adding to this, I'm going to show her that I have read what she wrote. This way, she will know the wrong I have done, for which I will apologize soon enough. She will also be aware that I know of her feelings, and perhaps we can meet in a middle by the end of all this.</p>
<p>I open the notebook and turn to her, my face expressionless for the moment, and begin to read. As soon as I finished reading the title, I heard an intake of breath from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>My Wish</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I wish you would miss me<br>
And hold me close to you<br>
I wish you would kiss me<br>
Because you wish to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I wish to make you happy<br>
Dry your tears of sadness<br>
Clear your heart when it's cloudy<br>
Fill you with endless happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I wish to be the reason for your laugh<br>
The reason for your smile<br>
The one when things get tough<br>
You call in speed dial.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I really wish to be<br>
The one you are in love with<br>
The one you look forward to see<br>
But makes it hard for you to breath.</p>
<p>I conclude the poem, but I'm not finished. I turned the page with the intention of reading what was behind it, but the notebook was snatched from my hands in a rather quick and slightly aggressive move.</p>
<p>"This <i>is</i> my notebook, how could you Miley!" She said without shouting, but I could feel the pressure of her voice just as easily as I saw the unshed tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Her reaction confirmed anything and everything to me, if I still had something to doubt. I saw her turn to her right and take a step that would surely lead a running pace to her house, but I did not want her to go. I wanted to talk this all out, I needed her to help me cure this immense sense of bewilderment that had taken a hold of me as strong as the one I had on that notebook for these past few days.</p>
<p>I reached out and grabbed her elbow firmly enough to deny her escape but not too rough as to hurt her. She turned to me, a deep scowl and tears painting her face.</p>
<p>"Wait Lily! I'm sorry; I know I shouldn't have taken your notebook. I shouldn't have even read it in the first place. I'm really, <i>really </i>sorry for doing it. But please, don't run away from me." I begged her, and I could feel the knot on my throat; a lump full of my regret, my shame, my fear of loosing my best friend.</p>
<p>Her whole body turned to me. I watch her clutch the notebook with all her might as she stared at the floor, tears still running down her pretty face.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." She breathed out, barely above a whispered but I heard it. I frowned, puzzle by her words. What could she ever be sorry about?</p>
<p>"What? What are you talking about? I'm the one who is sorry. You have nothing to apologize for." I replied, trying to make sense of her words.</p>
<p>"No. I'm sorry you had to read this. I should have not written it, not even thought it. I'm sorry you had to know about these…disgusting feelings your best friend has for you." She said. I felt she wanted to say something more, but I did not give her the chance.</p>
<p>"So you regret them? Or are they not true?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"No!" I do not regret them! And they are the truest thing you will find in me." – She exclaims, recovering her eyes from the floor and looking deeply into mine. But just for second, before the grounds retakes them. – "But…I know they are not something you wanted to hear.</p>
<p>"What makes you so sure?" I say. Now it is I who is looking somewhere else. At the moment, I am staring at the porch of my house; still I got that distinctive sensation of her eyes on me.</p>
<p>Thinking, that what I'm about to say deserves to be said to her directly instead of into some invisible being of to the side, I gather the courage and turn my head towards her and find the prettiest blue eyes I had ever seen, darken now by her tears, staring questioningly at me.</p>
<p>"Lily, I do not think your feelings are disgusting, not at all. In fact they are the furthest thing from that. You have no idea of how reading your poems, and knowing that they were written because of me, made me feel. No one has made me feel so special with just mere words that haven't even been spoken to me." I confessed.</p>
<p>"What are you trying to say?" She has stopped crying now; clearly relieved to know I am not revolted by her affections. But at the same time, she is wary of my words, careful as to not get her hopes up. Good, because that's the last thing I want to do at the moment.</p>
<p>"…I don't know. I mean, I can tell you that the fact that you like me does not disgust me, on the contrary it flatters me so very much, like I already said. And during the whole last night, the only one I have thought about is you. How it would be to be with you? Honestly, I think it would be very awkward in some moments, yet in others it seems like it could be as close to perfection as we can have in this world. So, by the end of it, I came to the conclusion that I am just totally confused." I explain as best as I can. I know there are other, perhaps better ways I could have said that, and there's so much more I wanted to say too, but in this instant, that's the best I can do.</p>
<p>"I understand." – She nods, then asks. – "But we are still friends right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, just like before. Actually, I think that even more now that there are no secrets between us." I say and she smiles softly. In her eyes I can see the immense happiness she feels for not loosing a friend, it's a feeling I share with her. However, I can also see the sadness she's working so hard to conceal.</p>
<p>There's something I have done in the past and I am not too proud of it. That thing is going out on dates for pity. But that's something I would never do to someone I really cared about, like Lily. I would never get Lily's hopes up just to drop her from a high pedestal. I love her so much; I just don't know what kind of love I'm feeling.</p>
<p>"You know, I do not want to get your hopes up, but I do not want to get them down either. So, let's just keep been how we are, and see what happens. Okay?" I asked. I do not want to shut this chance down just because is something I never thought of before, or because it's not traditional. Because I know, that you'll never know what you can find until you give it a chance. And, there's something telling me, that I should indeed arise to the occasion.</p>
<p>Lily stays silent for a few seconds; I guess she's thinking on whether or not she wants to wait for me. I don't have to wait long for her silent reply which came in the form of a sincere smile.</p>
<p>"Um, so I repeat: we don't have much homework today, so do you want to come over to my house?" She asks while taking her backpack of her shoulders to put away that eventful notebook. I take this time to retrieve my own, which is still there obediently waiting for me before my feet; not that is has any other choice.</p>
<p>"Sure!" I answer happily. I wait until she has placed her backpack over her shoulders again before walking forward and linking our arms.</p>
<p>All the guilt and shame and fear, and just plainly all those bad and uncomfortable feelings have gone away for the moment. And I am so grateful to that Divine God up there for that. Because I like this, I like the comfort of been with Lily and been just myself while with her. No pretenses and no forcefulness into doing what I'm doing. I am just me and she is just her and we have a great time just been us.</p>
<p>And who knows, maybe with time we'll be something more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i><u>Fin</u></i></p>
<p><b>A/N: I have the feeling this was not the ending you were expecting. I know, I didn't like it either. Yet this was the finale I had planned to give it since the beginning. You see, I have never been so disgustingly perplexed in my life. My best friend told me something (along the lines of this story) that just fucking confused me to no end (she pretty much fucked my life up in a way. It's like, if I tell you I have cookies on top the refrigerator but you can't eat them because you don't reach; but what can we do huh?) so my own confusion was the inspiration to write this story. Perhaps it'll have a sequel, I don't now yet, it all depends. On what? If does who read it and review actually want a sequel, if I get ideas for it, and if I get the inspiration for it. </b></p>
<p><b>Still, don't forget to review and tell me what you think of it! Thanks for reading! </b></p>
