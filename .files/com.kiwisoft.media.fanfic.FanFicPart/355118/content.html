<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Six -->

<p>"Favorite color?" Brooke asked later as she still lay sprawled on Sam's bed. Sam, who had climbed onto the bed beside her, yawned. </p>
<p>"Indigo," she responded. </p>
<p>"That's a nice color," Brooke commented as she too yawned. "Don't do that, it's contagious." </p>
<p>"Sorry," Sam mumbled. Brooke lifted her head slightly and looked down at the half-asleep form beside her. Sam's eyes her nearly shut, her lips slightly parted and she was totally relaxed. And Brooke was totally captivated by her. She'd never seen anything anything as beautiful or innocent looking as Sam at that moment. She doubted that even with her memory intact that there'd be anything to rival it. </p>
<p>(Oh man, I can't believe I'm falling for her) Brooke sighed to herself. Yet from the moment she'd regained consciousness, she'd felt an inexplicable pull towards Sam. She hadn't really tried to fight it either since it was obviously what her heart wanted. Sam's eyes fluttered shut and she let out a long sigh as she fell asleep. Brooke smiled at the preciousness of the situation. She reached out to brush some stray hair away from Sam's face. Her hand lingered to stroke Sam's warm cheek and she was astounded to watch Sam lean slightly into her hand.</p>
<p>Bolstered by what she considered a positive reaction from Sam, Brooke let her hand wander over Sam's face, tracing the contours of the beautiful brunette's features. She was careful not to wake Sam and break the trust the girl obviously had in her. She traced the plane of Sam's forehead, down the bridge of her nose, over the slope of her cheekbones and full lips to her chin. She mapped the terrain as if to never forget it again. She wondered briefly how she could have forgotten someone as special as Sam to begin with. </p>
<p>(I wonder if I knew I was gay before the accident) she pondered as she settled down close to Sam, throwing one arm around the other girl's waist and holding on tight. </p>
<p>(I was dating Harrison so I was probably in denial) she decided as she watched the slow and steady rise of Sam's chest as she slept. (I wonder about Sam though) </p>
<p>Sam had been her rock and her anchor since she'd woken up. She kept Brooke steady and feeling safe. Brooke was so lost without any memory of who she was or anyone else was. It was an incredibly frightening situation to be in. But Sam was there, calm, understanding and patient. She didn't want or expect anything from Brooke. She was obviously just glad that Brooke had survived the accident at all. Sam was dealing with everything else at the same rate Brooke was, one second at a time. Brooke knew she'd never be able to thank her enough for that.</p>
<p>One of the most frustrating things for Brooke was everyone's expectations of her. Who she SHOULD be, how she SHOULD act, what she SHOULD remember. Everyone else held the person she was now up against the person she once was. To Brooke now, that girl was nothing more than a ghost in a photograph. She had no idea who that perky, blonde cheerleader was and it annoyed her that everyone expected her to snap back into being her. Brooke knew that there was a strong possibility that that might never happen. The `old' Brooke could be gone forever and she was afraid that no one was willing to accept the `new' one. No one except maybe Sam.</p>
<p>Sam seemed willing and able to pick up at this moment and move on. She took Brooke at face value and was getting to know her as Brooke got to know herself. It made Brooke feel less scared and isolated. It also gave her the strength to wake up in the morning to know that Sam would be right by her side to face the new day as well. </p>
<p>Before she faded off to sleep as well, Brooke leaned over and kissed Sam softly on the cheek. </p>
<p>"Thank you Sammy," she murmured as she drifted off. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>(Well, this is?odd) Sam decided upon waking up and finding Brooke cuddled up beside her sound asleep. There was the tiniest blissfilled smile pulling at the corners of Brooke's lips which only served to make the situation even more odd to Sam. Not that she minded. She would gladly play body pillow to Brooke anytime, the gorgeous blonde need only ask. </p>
<p>Sam groaned to herself as she reran that last thought. Here was Brooke, lying there with minor brain damage, taking comfort where she could get it and Sam was letting her libido lead her around like a horny floppy earred bunny rabbit. </p>
<p>(Some friend you are) she scolded herself hotly. (She's depending on you and you can't get your mind out of the gutter for two minutes. God, I should be shot) Brooke murmured something and cuddled closer. </p>
<p>(She's hurt, vulnerable, and confused. I swear I will not take advantage of that) she vowed. (I'll be here if she needs me but nothing more) </p>
<p>Brooke twitched, growing more aggitated and it became apparent to Sam that the lanky blonde was having a nightmare. She shifted for better access to Brooke and gently stroked some damp hair away from Brooke's forehead. </p>
<p>"Easy, Brooke," she soothed as Brooke shook and whimpered against her, buring her fists in Sam's shirt. "You're safe. I'm right here." </p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke whimpered in her sleep as Sam kept petting her hair. Sam smiled lopsided at her. </p>
<p>"Shhhh?it's OK," she reassured the sleeping girl. Brooke's grip on her tightened but the nightmare seemed to fade and she settled back down. </p>
<p>"My Sammy?" she whispered happily. Sam stared at her in happy shock. She kissed Brooke's forehead lightly. </p>
<p>"Always." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke blinked sleepily and looked into Sam's smiling face. </p>
<p>"Good morning," Sam greeted her. "Slept well, I trust?" she asked while gesturing down at the fact that Brooke was draped rather intimately over her. Brooke looked down and bushed. </p>
<p>"Morning," she whispered back. "Sorry," she added beginning to move. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Eh, whatever," she said calmly. Inside she was disappointed that Brooke had moved. Again she yelled at herself for letting her hormones get the better of her. She propped herself up on one elbow and looked at Brooke. </p>
<p>"Not that I mind, but how come you never made it to your room last night?" she asked gently. Brooke thought a few minutes. </p>
<p>"It's too cold in there," she finally concluded. Sam pondered this silently for several moments. </p>
<p>"We could have gotten you some extra blankets," she said at last. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Not `cold' temperature wise, Sam. `Cold' as in unfriendly. Like no one lives there. I didn't feel welcome in that room," she explained quietly. </p>
<p>"But you should, it's your room," Sam told her softly. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, it's `her' room," she argued getting upset. "And I'm not HER!" A few tears slipped down her cheeks and Sam automatically reached up to wipe them away. </p>
<p>"Hey, don't cry," she soothed. "I know you're not `her'," she said as Brooke buried her face in her chest. </p>
<p>(First off, Brooke would never do THAT) Sam reminded herself silently. </p>
<p>"And you're welcome in here anytime if that's what you want," she added. Brooke lifted her head and sniffled. </p>
<p>"Really?" she asked hopefully. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Really. Although I have to tell you you're supposed to be working on getting YOUR life back, not stealing mine. Besides, mine isn't worth having," she joked weakly. Brooke arched an eyebrow at her. </p>
<p>"There you go again. Why do you do that? Why do you put yourself down all the time?" she asked slightly annoyed. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno, habit I guess," she answered absently. </p>
<p>"Well, break it. Or at least don't do it around me. I don't like it," Brooke informed her. Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"You never did," she snickered. </p>
<p>"Glad to see that the important things haven't changed." </p>
