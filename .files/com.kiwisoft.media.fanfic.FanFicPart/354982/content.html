<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 36: A New Friend -->

<p>The bottom of the wagon was covered with caked on mud, as were
		both women from the splattering of the wheels. The strong rains left puddles of
		indeterminate depth in their path, forcing both travelers to sit as close to the center of
		the seat as possible in order to avoid the constant splashes. One particularly large one
		caught the young blonde in the face, causing her to sputter and curse while Josie chuckled
		at her predicament. She chuckled, that is, until an equally strong splash caught the
		gunslinger even worse than the one that had soaked Rebecca. Josie used her bandanna to
		wipe off the muddy water while the young woman guffawed.</p>

		<p>A cracking sound almost like a rifle shot rang out and the wagon
		lurched and came to a shuddering stop. Josie's brow furrowed as she handed the reins to
		Rebecca and vaulted over the side of the wagon. "What's wrong?" Rebecca called
		to the gunslinger who crouched next to the wheels. "Not another bad wheel?"</p>

		<p>"No, not the wheel," Josie said dejectedly. "The
		axle."</p>

		<p>"What?" She climbed down immediately and squatted down
		next to the gunslinger. The tall woman pointed to the edge where the axle met the wagon.
		The wood was clearly fractured to the point where one more solid jostling would cause its
		demise. "What are we going to do?"</p>

		<p>Josie stood up and looked around, trying to keep her frustration
		from erupting in a litany of expletives guaranteed to color her younger friend's ears.
		"Good question, Rebecca. We're too far away from anywhere to get a cartwright or
		smith to help. I don't think that axle will last more than five miles." She gripped
		the edge of the buckboard so tightly that her knuckles whitened, an action not unnoticed
		by Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"It's all right, Josie. We'll figure something out."
		She reached over and placed her smaller hand on top of the gunslingers. "Look, you
		said we're too far away to go back, right? So let's just keep going forward. We know
		there's nothing behind us." Rebecca felt the grip beneath her hand ease. "Who
		knows what will show up within the next five miles."</p>

		<p>"What or who," the gunslinger corrected, pulling out
		one of her colts and checking it. She untied Phoenix from the back of the wagon and began
		to saddle her up. "You lead Flossy, but be gentle about it. She's used to being
		driven, not led."</p>

		<p>As an added precaution, they redistributed the weight so that the
		majority was above the rear wheel opposite the stress point. While it made the load seem
		heavier to Flossy, it still was within her limits and she slowly moved forward. Josie rode
		Phoenix, keeping near the damaged axle yet still keeping Rebecca and the road within her
		vision. Although her face betrayed no emotion, inside she was fuming at her inability to
		repair the wagon. Even just a few nails and strips of metal would help her brace it until
		they reached Boise City, both items that they didn't have. It was a slow trek, with Josie
		stopping them now and again to guide the wagon around some of the deeper bumps in the
		road. Rebecca went slowly. She watched the trail carefully for the deceiving puddles that
		could spell disaster for the buckboard. The combined care from both women resulted in the
		axle lasting more than twice the distance than the gunslinger had predicted. Josie heard
		the creaking, jumped off Phoenix, and had a barrel wedged under the wagon before the axle
		groaned and snapped like a handful of pencils. The corner dropped only a couple of inches
		before landing on the flat top of the barrel. The instant she heard the gunslinger
		dismount, Rebecca stopped Flossy and watched in amazement as her friend moved with a
		fluidity and grace that was both strong and supple at the same time. She knew that Josie
		was a strong woman, stronger than any she had ever met, but to see her lift the barrel
		half-filled with water with little more than a grunt was enough to leave the young woman
		speechless. Never had she seen even one of the men in Chancetown lift something so heavy
		so easily.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca?" The gunslinger looked at her and immediately
		recognized the expression of awe. She'd seen it before from various men when she'd best
		them in arm wrestling or boxing.</p>

		<p>"Huh? Oh, what?" She said, snapping out of her trance.</p>

		<p>"Nothing. We're going to have to leave the wagon here.
		Unhitch Flossy and pack her up as much as possible." She watched as Rebecca nodded
		and went about her task. Josie smiled to herself as she started to load up Phoenix's
		saddlebags. 'Think I'm a huckleberry above a persimmon, do ya sprite?' She thought to
		herself. 'Don't put me on a pedestal; I'm no hero.'</p>

		<p>Within minutes, everything of importance that they could strap to
		the two horses was in place and they set out on foot, Josie in the lead. Mud sucked at
		their feet and both women were mud splattered and bedraggled looking when less than a mile
		later they came upon a small ranch set far from the trail, yet still noticeable to someone
		with vision as keen as the gunslingers. Removing the saddlebags from Phoenix and tossing
		them on the ground, Josie motioned for Rebecca to come close. "I'm going up to check
		it out. You stay here with Flossy and the gear. No matter what, don't move until I come
		and get you, understand?" She waited for the young woman to agree before mounting
		Phoenix and riding off toward the ranch.</p>

		<p>The house was in such disrepair that Josie wondered if anyone
		lived there at all until she heard the familiar sound of a rifle bolt being readied behind
		the door. She carefully crouched down and cocked the hammer on her colt. "I don't
		want any trouble."</p>

		<p>"Then what in Sam Hill do you want?" A voice hoarse
		from too many years of smoking called from behind the door.</p>

		<p>"My wagon broke down. If you have a flat piece of metal and
		a couple of nails, I'll gladly pay you for them and be on my way." She kept her voice
		non-threatening, not wanting to scare the old codger.</p>

		<p>"Where's your husband?" The old man asked while moving
		from window to window looking for signs of an ambush.</p>

		<p>"Don't have one. Look, I'm not gonna hurt you. If I can just
		go into your barn, I'm sure I can find what I need and be gone." She put her gun back
		in its holster, confident that the old man wasn't a danger.</p>

		<p>"Wagon broke?" He asked, his voice right behind the
		door. She carefully lowered her left gun belt to the ground, not wanting to appear too
		armed but also not wanting to appear defenseless either.</p>

		<p>"Yes. Back a ways." She stood up from her crouched
		position, keeping her hand near her sidearm just in case. One brown eye looked out from
		the Indian door, a small hinged opening at eye level within the paneling of the main door.</p>

		<p>"And you say you're alone?" The Indian door opened
		wider, revealing an old man not much taller than Rebecca. Glasses with thick black metal
		frames rested upon his nose, his white hair receded at the temples.</p>

		<p>"I said I didn't have a husband." She responded, not
		wanting to give too much information away. The Indian door closed and the latch on the
		front door lifted slightly. Josie remained still as the old man pushed the muzzle of his
		sixteen shot rifle through the small opening before following it onto the porch. In the
		daylight, the gunslinger got her first clear look at the old man. Easily in his sixties,
		his drawn face still reflected the handsome man of his youth. He returned the gaze,
		studying the strange woman standing before him, noting the muscles that showed so clearly
		beneath the worn black shirt and the menacing looking gun strapped to her thigh. After a
		moment, he spoke.</p>

		<p>"How bad is it?" He said, lowering his rifle slightly.</p>

		<p>"Axle," she replied. "I can brace it with a piece
		of metal and some nails, at least enough to get to Boise City."</p>

		<p>"Doubt it," He said, taking a cigarette out of his
		shirt pocket along with a match. He struck the match against the porch rail and lit the
		cigarette, taking a long drag before exhaling. "Nothing like fine tobacco. Road
		between here and Cheyanne is flat compared to from here to Boise City. Nope, what you need
		is a new axle." He walked over and sat down on his porch swing, the weapon resting
		non-threateningly next to him. Josie hooked her thumbs through her leather belt,
		deliberately keeping her right hand away from her colt, and sat down on the porch step. He
		looked off at nothing, flicking the ashes of his cigarette onto the wooden porch.
		"Yup, a new axle, that'd be all that'll get you there." With a flick of his
		fingers, the remains of the cigarette flew in an arc off of the porch and onto the ground,
		joining a dozen other butts scattered nearby. "I have one."</p>

		<p>"How much?" She asked, hoping to end the visit and get
		on her way. He smiled at her, revealing a full set of false teeth and chuckled.</p>

		<p>"Money don't do me no good, little girl." He looked
		around the overgrown field, then up at the roof of the porch, inspecting the many holes
		that allowed sunlight to pour through. "Nope, what I need is an honest day's work, if
		you and whoever you got hiding somewhere got the mind to do it."</p>

		<p>"What do you want done?" She asked, certain that she
		wasn't going to like the terms.</p>

		<p>"I need a new roof. Been leaking for close to a year now.
		You fix that, you can have the axle." He sat back and waited for her answer.</p>

		<p>Josie glanced up at the porch, noting that a simple patch job
		would not be of any good, the wood was far too rotted. "It would take a couple of
		days to replace the roof," she replied, indicating in her tone that the price was too
		high. He laughed deep in his chest, causing a short coughing fit before he regained his
		composure.</p>

		<p>"Take you more than a couple of days, missy. I'm meaning the
		whole roof," he said, pointing to the house. Josie's blue eyes narrowed.</p>

		<p>"That's an outrageous amount of work just for an axle,"
		she protested.</p>

		<p>"Suit yourself," he replied. "Don't matter none to
		me...I'm not the one with a broken wagon."</p>

		<p>They sat there for several long moments, he smoking another
		cigarette and she fighting the urge to just intimidate him into a more reasonable trade. A
		vision of him trying to climb up on the roof and repair it himself flashed through her
		mind. "I'll fix your roof in trade for the axle, but you have to provide me and my
		companion with a place to stay until I'm finished."</p>

		<p>"I don't put up with none of that fornicating in my
		home," he said, tossing the cigarette over the porch rail to join the others. "I
		have one extra room. You can stay there, he can sleep in the barn."</p>

		<p>"It's not a he, it's a she," Josie replied. "A
		young woman. Good cook too." The old man smiled at that information.</p>

		<p>"Well then..." He looked up at the setting sun.
		"It's too late to do anything today. Go get your friend and you can start in the
		morning," he said as he rose and walked to the door. "If your friend has a mind
		to, there's vittles in the kitchen. Tell her I don't mind none if she feels like cooking
		something for dinner." He said it matter-of-factly, but the look in his eyes told
		another story. She wondered how long it had been since he had someone else cook a meal for
		him.</p>

		<p>Josie remained seated on the porch for a few minutes after the
		door closed, thinking about the old man and the deal she'd agreed to. Redoing a roof was a
		tall order and far too high a price for a simple axle, but she also knew that there was no
		other way he was going to get it fixed. She stood and stretched, knowing full well that it
		would be the last time for quite a while that her muscles wouldn't feel sore. Picking up
		her discarded gun belt, she turned and headed for Phoenix.</p>

		<p>"Any luck?" Rebecca asked once the gunslinger was
		within earshot. Josie dismounted and dropped the reins, letting Phoenix munch on the
		overgrown grass.</p>

		<p>"There's an old man that lives there. He has an axle, but I
		have to do a job for him before he'll let us have it," she explained while picking up
		her discarded saddlebags. "We'll be staying here for a few days."</p>

		<p>"A few days? What kind of job is it?" Rebecca asked
		apprehensively.</p>

		<p>"He needs a new roof," she replied. "And perhaps
		some company. Looks like he's been alone for some time."</p>

		<p>"A roof is an awful lot of work, Josie."</p>

		<p>"I don't have a choice. We need that axle, unless you want
		to walk the rest of the way," she said as she secured the gear to Phoenix.</p>

		<p>"Walk the rest of the way? Oh, no thanks. But I'm not
		getting up on a roof."</p>

		<p>"Don't worry, Rebecca. I'll be the carpenter. You get to be
		the washerwoman. Place looks like it hasn't seen a woman's touch in years," she said,
		grinning when she saw the younger woman roll her eyes.</p>

		<p>They were within arm's reach of the porch when the door opened
		and the old man stepped out. Rebecca smiled warmly and headed toward him. Josie, always
		distrustful of strangers, stayed back and lowered her hands until they were within easy
		reach of her guns.</p>

		<p>"Hello, my name is Rebecca," she said.</p>

		<p>"Charles...Charles Bragg." He took the offered hand and
		kissed it, as befitting a young lady. "Welcome to my home," he said as he pushed
		open the door and held his hand out, inviting her to enter first. In the blink of an eye,
		Josie was on the porch and within easy reach of both of them, not wanting to let her young
		friend out of her sight, despite the lack of any feeling of danger. Rebecca entered and
		stood just inside the doorway, trying to take everything in with one polite glance. Stale
		smoke and air assaulted her nose, as well as layers upon layers of dust. Josie hadn't been
		kidding when she said that she didn't think the place had seen a woman's touch in years.
		The front door opened into what was obviously once a parlor, now nothing more than a dusty
		living area. It was apparent from the pillow and blanket on the couch that Charles spent
		most if not all of his time there. Empty whiskey jugs and tin cans were scattered about
		the floor, as were dozens of cigarette butts. A metal plate on the end table overflowed
		with the burnt out matches used to light the rolled tobacco. To the right was the kitchen,
		a place where Charles obviously spent very little time, if any at all. Everything, except
		the well pump was covered in the same thick layer of dust as the parlor. Cobwebs littered
		every corner and crevice possible. Had he not been standing next to her, Rebecca would
		have sworn that no one had occupied the house in years. "Oh, let me get you a chair,
		Miss," Charles said apologetically, moving past her to dust the seat of a wooden
		chair with an equally dusty rag. "I don't usually get company, 'cept my brother
		Horace, and he don't mind the place the way it is."</p>

		<p>The fresh wave of dust tickled Rebecca's nose, causing her to
		sneeze uncontrollably. "Would you...achoo...excuse me p-p-p'achoo...please?" She
		made a hasty retreat out to the fresh air. She leaned forward against the rail of the
		porch and breathed deeply.</p>

		<p>"Pretty bad, huh?" The gunslinger said from behind her,
		fully expecting the young woman to jump and completely surprised when she didn't.
		"Rebecca?"</p>

		<p>"There's more dirt there than in boot hill," the
		younger woman said, pulling her handkerchief out of her pocket.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, how did you know I was behind you?" Josie
		asked, leaning against the rail next to the blonde.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I recognized your footsteps. Charles isn't wearing
		boots but you are," she said simply. She blinked twice and looked at the gunslinger.
		"Hey, that's pretty good, huh? I figured out who it was without looking." Her
		voice was so full of pride at the feat that Josie had no choice but to smile. Rebecca
		enjoyed the feeling for a moment before she became serious again. "How can someone
		live like that? He must be lonely."</p>

		<p>"I think he is, but we're only here as long as it takes for
		me to fix the roof." Josie thought about adding 'don't get attached', but knew
		better. Nothing she said would make a difference in that department. "Do you think
		you can work the stove? From what I saw from the doorway, looked like it hasn't seen a
		fire in years."</p>

		<p>"If the flue is clear, I shouldn't have any problem,"
		the young woman replied. "We'd better check that."</p>

		<p>Charles took the horses to the barn while the women went into the
		kitchen and checked the stovepipe for obstructions. Josie pulled her soot-covered arm from
		the pipe. "Feels clear," she said, wiping her hand against her shirt.</p>

		<p>"Josie, do you know how hard it is to get soot out of a
		shirt?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca chastised as she handed the gunslinger a damp rag.</p>

		<p>"But it's a black shirt," she said innocently.
		"That's why I wear them. Hides everything." She wiped her hands as best she
		could and handed the rag back to the young woman.</p>

		<p>"Keep it up and you can do your own laundry, Miss 'I don't
		do laundry.'"</p>

		<p>"But Rebecca..." she rubbed some of the soot off her
		shirtsleeve with her forefinger. "That's what I have you for," she said sweetly,
		touching the tip of the young woman's nose with her soot-covered finger. She held the
		blackened digit up for Rebecca to see while taking a step back and smiling wickedly.</p>

		<p>"You didn't..." The young woman touched her nose and
		inspected her fingers. "You did." Her green eyes narrowed. "I'll get you
		for that one, just you wait." She picked up the damp rag without thinking and tried
		to wipe the soot off her nose. Josie took one look at the smeared black mess on Rebecca's
		face and laughed lightly while removing her bandanna.</p>

		<p>"I'm sure you think you will, Rebecca," she said as she
		wrapped the scarf around her finger and spit on it. "Come here."</p>

		<p>"Are you joshing?" The young woman protested, stepping
		back against the edge of the sink.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, everyone knows that spit removes everything,"
		Josie said, reaching forward with one hand to hold the young woman's head still while she
		wiped the soot off. "There, all better."</p>

		<p>"Land sakes, Josie, I'm not a little kid," she scowled.
		"It's your fault anyway. I'm still going to get you back for that, you know,"
		she said, wagging a finger at the taller woman.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh," the gunslinger smirked. "We'll see about
		that, sprite."</p>

		<p>Rebecca smiled at the pet name and looked around the dusty
		kitchen. "Uh, do you want to ask him where he keeps his food?"</p>

		<p>Josie took a long look around. "Not a chance." She put
		her hat on just as Charles entered. He nodded and sat down on the couch. Opening the tin
		on the end table, he pulled out a cigarette and match. "I'm going to see if I can
		round up a rabbit or two," Josie said. She knelt down and pulled the bowie knife from
		her left boot and slipped it into the younger woman's right one before standing back up.
		"Just in case," she whispered. Rebecca nodded, knowing full well in her heart
		that everything would be fine.</p>

		<p>"So Charles," Rebecca said while trying to get a fire
		going in the long cold stove. "How long have you lived here?"</p>

		<p>"I reckon been close to twenty years now; moved out here
		back in fifty seven. Horace, now he's only been out here for about five years, since his
		wife died and all. Runs trade from Boise City to Cheyanne once a month. Always stops here
		both ways for a spell and to drop off fixins for me."</p>

		<p>"So that's how you get your food and tobacco?" She
		asked, taking a seat on the bench opposite his, forgetting all about getting the stove
		working.</p>

		<p>"Yup. Every month he brings me two tins of tobacco and a
		score of</p>

		<p>Van Camps," he said as he lit another cigarette.</p>

		<p>"All you eat is beans from a can?" She said
		incredulously. "You don't get any meat or bread?"</p>

		<p>"Sometimes Horace'll bring in some salt pork, but ain't too
		often." He reached over and patted her hand. "Now don't you go worrying about
		me. I've been living this way ever since Ruth passed on and I've been just fine. You and
		your friend there have better..." He looked around, noticing for the first time that
		the tall, dark headed woman was nowhere in sight. "Where'd your friend go?"</p>

		<p>"She went to get something other than beans to eat. Oh, that
		reminds me..." She got up and went back to the stove. "Charles? If you didn't
		use the stove or a pot to heat your beans up with, what did you use?"</p>

		<p>He grinned, stood up, and walked over to the fireplace. "I
		have to use this to keep the place warm now that the Northers are coming. I just put the
		can here." He pointed to the large black pot hanging from a hinged arm. "And
		swing it out over the fire. Few minutes it's done." He busied himself with picking up
		the multitude of cans that littered the floor near the fireplace while Rebecca silently
		prayed that Josie was successful in her hunting.</p>

		<p>Josie returned with two small rabbits, the look on her face when
		she handed the skinned carcasses over made it clear that she was just as disappointed as
		her friend. "Don't you worry about me, I've got my Van</p>

		<p>Camps, you two go on ahead," he said. Josie walked up behind
		Rebecca, so close that only they could hear each other.</p>

		<p>"Stew?"</p>

		<p>"Stew," the young woman replied. Josie gave a gentle
		squeeze on her shoulder. She knew that Rebecca was tired of stew and had been looking
		forward to some fried meat for a change.</p>

		<p>"Charles, save the beans for another night. Rebecca's making
		rabbit stew and there'll be plenty for everyone." The look in his aged eyes reminded
		the gunslinger of the look she received when she gave Rebecca the medical book.</p>

		<p>"Well, if you're sure," he said, the can of beans that
		was in his hand already put back with the rest of the pile. "If you need flour, I'm
		sure Ruth had some around here...." He went into the kitchen and started to open
		drawers that hadn't seen the light of day in ages. Josie quickly went over and put her
		hand out to block him from the rest of the drawers.</p>

		<p>"No, don't worry about it. We have plenty of flour, don't we
		Rebecca?" The thought of adding anything to the meal that came from the dust-covered
		drawers had no appeal to the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Plenty," the young woman agreed emphatically, making a
		mental note to empty the drawers first thing tomorrow.</p>

		<p>It was almost dusk by the time dinner was finished. Josie went to
		check on the horses, the best excuse she could come up with for not staying put and being
		sociable, while Rebecca washed up the dishes and made a pot of coffee.</p>

		<p>"Well, guess it's time," Charles said as he rose from
		his chair and headed for the front door.</p>

		<p>"Time for what?" The young woman asked, following him.</p>

		<p>"Time to lower the flag of course."</p>

		<p>They stood in the front yard next to the tall wooden pole. With
		great reverence, he slowly lowered the flag. "Your flag's wrong," Rebecca
		commented. He stopped lowering it and looked at her. "I mean, there's only thirty-six
		stars on it. There's thirty-eight states now."</p>

		<p>"Missy, when I served this country in the Great War of the
		states, there were only thirty-four. By the time the army let me go, there were
		thirty-six. This is the flag they gave me when I was discharged and this is the flag I'll
		fly," he said adamantly. "Bad enough we keep adding states without having to
		worry about how many darn stars are on the flag. At the rate Hayes is talking, we'll have
		a hundred of ?em before the century's out." He finished lowering the flag and
		folded it up for the night.</p>

		<p>Josie managed to hide out in the barn until it was almost
		bedtime. Only then did she return to the others. Charles added some logs to the fire,
		readying it for the long night. "The bedroom is over there. Don't know what you'll
		find, haven't been in that room in ages. Used to be my daughter Lillian's room before she
		up and moved to Illinois," he said as he opened a tin and pulled out a cigarette.
		"Now I snore a little bit, so you just don't pay me no attention."</p>

		<p>Both women made quick trips to the outhouse before turning in.
		Rebecca didn't like the look of either the mattress or the blankets that had long covered
		it. She stripped it and replaced the linens with their own blankets and pillows, setting
		Josie's on the outside of the bed, as she knew the ever-cautious gunslinger would want.
		Rebecca changed into her long nightgown and climbed into bed, moving as close to the wall
		as possible to make room on the narrow mattress for Josie. The gunslinger stripped down to
		her longjohns and slipped between the covers, her arm automatically going around the
		younger woman's waist. Rebecca settled back against her and both fell asleep within
		minutes.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca...Rebecca, it's time to wake up," Josie tried
		gently, knowing that it probably wouldn't work. She was tempted to let her young friend
		sleep, especially knowing that it was the first good night's sleep Rebecca had gotten
		since they left Cheyenne. Looking at the sleeping face, the gunslinger noticed that the
		dark circles that had ringed her eyes were gone. Josie had been relieved to wake up and
		find that she had gone the entire night without a nightmare. Sometimes she wasn't sure
		which was worse, the nightmares or knowing that she kept waking up her friend. Rebecca
		stirred and buried her head deeper into her pillow. "Oh no you don't. I want
		coffee," the gunslinger muttered.</p>

		<p>She shook the young woman on the shoulder. "Come on,
		Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Hrrmmphf."</p>

		<p>"Is that your way of saying good morning?"</p>

		<p>"Hrmmpf...go away."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." she said sternly.</p>

		<p>"All right, all right," the tired voice said. A
		half-awake Rebecca crawled out of bed, eyes practically closed, and headed for the spot
		near the wall where their boots were sitting. One green eye focused on the two pairs, one
		black, and the other deep brown. She slipped her feet into the black ones.</p>

		<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

		<p>"Easier," she mumbled before opening the bedroom door
		and heading to the outhouse, the oversized boots clumping against the floor.</p>

		<p>An hour later, all three were up, dressed, and sitting around the
		table drinking coffee. "I reckon I'd better get started. Where are your tools?"
		Josie asked.</p>

		<p>"Everything's in the work shed. At least it should be.
		Haven't been out there in a while," Charles responded.</p>

		<p>"No matter, I'm sure I'll find what I need." She stood
		up and downed the last of her coffee. "I want to change that axle first and bring our
		wagon up."</p>

		<p>Charles leapt from his seat, his brown eyes wide. "No! You
		can't have the axle until the roof is fixed. We have a deal." The look on his face
		was near panic. Rebecca reached over and put her hand on the gunslinger's thigh. When she
		had the gunslinger's attention, she shook her head slightly, imploring the taller woman to
		let it go.</p>

		<p>"Fine. I'll fix the roof, but I have to go back and get the
		rest of our supplies. Can I use your wagon?" She was met with a hearty laugh.</p>

		<p>"Child, my wagon hasn't moved in eleven years."</p>

		<p>"Terrific," she growled. "Guess I'll be up on the
		roof if you need me."</p>

		<p>"Josie, be careful up there, okay?" Rebecca said. The
		gunslinger, still aggravated over the whole turn of events, merely nodded and put her hat
		on. The young woman watched her leave, then looked around the room. The bright morning
		light made all the dust and grime seem ten times worse than it had the day before. She
		decided that another cup of coffee was in order before she started her new chore, that
		being to make the neglected house look livable.</p>

		<p>Once inside the work barn, Josie found the pile of lumber in the
		corner as well as a bucket of nails and a worn-out hammer. "Uh huh, one swing and the
		head is gonna go flying," she said out loud. She tossed the useless tool back down on
		the workbench and looked around the barn. In the far corner sat a wagon missing all its
		wheels. She went over and inspected the front axle, pleased to see that despite its
		neglected appearance it was still in good shape. She picked up the rusty crowbar and
		hooked it though her belt before hefting the wooden ladder onto her shoulder and leaving
		the barn.</p>

		<p>She sat on the top of the pitched roof, one leg straddling each
		side, and began the slow process of pulling out the cedar shingles. Josie inspected each
		one carefully, tossing the rotted ones to the left and the good ones to the right for
		reuse. The morning sun beat down on her mercilessly, forcing her to wrap her bandanna
		around her forehead to keep the sweat out of her eyes. The day had just started yet her
		arms were already beginning to protest from her straining to remove old rusted nails.</p>

		<p>Rebecca wrapped her bandanna around her head to keep her hair
		back. She used the corn broom to sweep out the cobwebs from the corners. Two hours later,
		all the dishes were piled on the table awaiting washing and the counters were wiped down.
		She stopped and wiped her brow with the back of her hand. Charles was nowhere in sight.
		Above her head she heard the sounds of Josie still working hard on the roof. As much as
		she wanted to stop and rest, there was no way she was going to until Josie did. With
		renewed determination, Rebecca threw herself back into her task, this time with a song on
		her lips.</p>

		<p>The soft, melodic voice filtered up to Josie's ears from the open
		door below. She recognized the haunting strains of "I Dream Of Jeanie" and felt
		a familiar tightness around her heart that she supposed that song would always evoke in
		her. She paused in her work to listen to the words, even though she knew they would likely
		bring tears to her eyes, but she was surprised to hear that Rebecca had changed the lyrics
		to ?I dream of Josie with the coal-black hair?.? Josie could scarcely
		believe what she was hearing. At first she thought that perhaps the young woman was trying
		to avoid the emotional scene that occurred the first time she sang that song for her. But
		the more she listened, the more likely it seemed that Rebecca was not even aware that her
		voice would be audible to Josie, and she was singing for herself. She was struck by the
		honesty in the girl?s voice; every word seemed to pour straight from her heart. She
		found herself wondering what truly had inspired Rebecca to change the lyrics. It was more
		than she could hope for that the younger woman might be falling for her. She had not truly
		realized until that moment how very much she loved Rebecca; her feelings had changed so
		subtly. She could no longer fool herself into believing that she simply wanted to protect
		the innocent girl until she could find a place to safely deposit her. She wanted Rebecca
		in her life. More than just wanted. She needed the stabilizing influence that Rebecca
		brought to her. Since she had made the choice to live outside the law so many years ago,
		this was the first time she found a reason to try to atone for the wrong she had done.
		Tears brimmed in her eyes as she listened to the heart-felt words. She wanted to climb
		down from the roof and take Rebecca in her arms and make love with her until they both
		collapsed. Fearing that would scare the innocent young girl away, she decided instead to
		court her. If Rebecca seemed responsive to her overtures, she would take the next steps.
		In her adult life, she had never allowed herself to be really touched by another human
		being, since she had lost every person she loved in her life. Her motto had been if you
		don?t let them touch you, they can?t hurt you, and she had been successful at
		keeping people at arms length. She couldn?t maintain that distance with Rebecca.
		Slowly the pretty blonde had chipped away at her defenses until Josie no longer wanted her
		to keep her distance.</p>

		<p>Josie was disappointed when the song ended, so wrapped up was she
		in the sound of Rebecca?s voice. When she started a new song Josie found herself
		joining in, albeit so softly that the younger woman couldn't hear her. The time and the
		work flew by until the sun was high in the sky. Josie's shirt was stuck to her back and
		both her bandanna and the brim of her hat were soaked from her efforts. She tossed the
		crowbar over the side of the roof and climbed down the ladder, all the muscles in her
		upper body protesting the abuse she had subjected them to.</p>

		<p>She had just put her foot on the ground when she saw Charles
		emerge from behind a clump of cottonwood trees, his glasses in his hands. Josie's keen
		vision noted the redness surrounding his soft brown eyes. She looked over at the trees,
		knowing without question that his wife's grave lay beyond them. The gunslinger waited
		until he was inside before she collected the pile of rotted cedar and set it with the rest
		of kindling on the side of the house. As she put the wood down she noticed a patch of wild
		flowers, and decided to pick a bunch for Rebecca. She gathered what she considered to be a
		lovely assortment of flowers, and dusting the grime from the roof off her clothes she
		headed in for lunch.</p>

		<p>Charles was seated at the table while Rebecca stirred the
		contents of the pot on the stove. Josie tossed her hat on the peg near the door and walked
		to where Rebecca stood, the flowers hidden behind her back. When she had Rebecca?s
		attention, she whipped the flowers around and handed them to her with a flourish.
		"The only thing in this room prettier than these flowers is you," she said
		softly so Charles wouldn?t hear. Rebecca?s mouth dropped open slightly and she
		stared first at the flowers and then at Josie, not sure what to make of such a display of
		affection. Rebecca?s cheeks flushed to think of Josie out picking flowers for her,
		and she grinned shyly at the gunslinger, not knowing what to say. When Rebecca made no
		move to put the flowers in water, Josie said, "Better put them in a vase or
		they?ll wilt like me." She sat down on the bench opposite the old man, her hands
		wrapping gratefully around the mug of water Rebecca had poured for her right before she
		came in.</p>

		<p>"Uh?right. Charles, do you have a vase?"</p>

		<p>"Should be one in that cupboard to your left," he
		replied with a sad smile. "Ruth loved those flowers," he said as Rebecca
		rummaged among the contents of the cupboard, finally finding what she sought. The vase was
		full of dirt, and she pumped some water into the sink and began to wash it. "Spring
		and summer and right into the fall, I picked her flowers every day as long as they were
		blooming. The house always smelled like a garden. I haven?t?picked any flowers
		since she died."</p>

		<p>Rebecca put the vase full of flowers in the center of the table,
		and the whole room seemed brighter and more cheerful. She patted Charles? hand and
		said, "After lunch we can pick some flowers for Ruth."</p>

		<p>"She?d like that," the old man said with a smile.
		Rebecca returned to the stove where she ladled stew into bowls. She set the steaming stew
		in front of Charles and Josie, and noticed as she did that Josie?s cheeks were more
		ruddy looking than usual, and the skin at the base of her throat was flushed red. She
		touched her face, and was surprised at the heat coming off of the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"You?re burning up," she said with a note of alarm
		in her voice. "Give me your bandanna," she said firmly. Josie was too hot to
		argue. The young woman took it to the pump and rinsed it with fresh water. She wrung it
		out slightly and unraveled it before giving it back.</p>

		<p>"Thanks," the gunslinger replied, slowly wiping her
		face with the cool cloth. Rebecca smiled and went back to the stove to get her own bowl of
		stew, and then she sat down on the bench next to her friend.</p>

		<p>"Thank you," Charles said to Rebecca as he dug into his
		stew. Around a mouthful he asked Josie, "How's the roof coming?"</p>

		<p>"Slowly. There's a lot of shingles that have to come down
		before</p>

		<p>I can even reach the boards. Just hope it doesn't rain
		again," the gunslinger responded.</p>

		<p>"Yup, got that wood oh...about two years ago, I guess.
		Horace brought it on one of his trips. Just ain't been able to get to it," he said
		with a shrug. "He'll be coming again in a couple of weeks. Be mighty surprised to
		find that roof done."</p>

		<p>"Bet he will. Probably figured it'd never get done,"
		Josie replied. She drained her mug of water but before she could rise to get another, the
		cup was out of her hand and Rebecca was standing at the pump. Rather than filling the mug
		with the first water from the pump, she raised and lowered the arm several times,
		resulting in a much cooler cup of water for the overheated gunslinger. Josie thanked her
		and drank half of it with one long series of swallows.</p>

		<p>After lunch, Josie ran the cool water from the pump over her
		head, soaking her hair and bandanna before picking up her hat and going back out to face
		the afternoon sun. With each groan from her aching muscles, the gunslinger silently
		reminded herself to get Rebecca to rub her down later.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca swept the main room while Charles settled himself on the
		couch and watched. "You don't have to do that," he said.</p>

		<p>"It's okay, I don't mind," she replied, stopping for a
		moment to rub her itching nose.</p>

		<p>"That's a good woman. You'll make some young man a fine
		wife." He opened the tin and pulled out the last rolled cigarette. "Now my Ruth,
		she was a fine woman. Kept the place spotless, she did. Never complained, no matter how
		bad it got." His brown eyes focused on the tin daguerreotype resting on the mantle.
		The picture showed a young man sitting next to a beautiful dark headed woman holding an
		equally dark headed child on her lap. Rebecca looked and noticed for the first time that
		it was the only thing in the room that wasn't covered with dust. "When the war broke
		out, we had to choose sides. Now we didn't care none</p>

		<p>about them coloreds or nothing, but I didn't want to see the
		country split neither. Sent Ruth and Lillian up to Boston with my kin and I ended up with
		the Union." He motioned for her to take a seat in the chair opposite the couch.
		"When they say it was brother against brother, they weren't joshing none. For us, it
		was cousin against cousin."</p>

		<p>"You fought your own cousin?"</p>

		<p>Charles took a long drag on his cigarette before answering.
		"That I did. Of course I was just a lowly sergeant and he was a general. General
		Braxton Bragg, full of piss and vinegar, he was. Darn fool so arrogant he called his
		cannons Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Thought he had God on his side. For a while it
		seemed like he did. I served under General George Thomas in Chickamauga. We joined up with
		General Rosecrans, poorest excuse for a general I ever saw, and fought Braxton and his
		men. ?Twernt that many more of them than us, but those cannons sure made the
		difference. Nothing but smoke and blood everywhere. We could have taken him, ?cepting
		that no good Rosecrans up and retreated. Old Pap Thomas, well he ordered us to stay put
		and keep fighting. Worst battle I ever saw and I believe one of the worst of the whole
		war. Well,</p>

		<p>Braxton got his wish and took Chickamauga from us, but we got him
		back for it." He paused to take a drink from his mug, and then continued. "He
		got too sure of himself, tried to take Chattanooga as well. Stationed his troops up on
		Lookout Mountain; guess he figured he was safe there until reinforcements arrived. Well,
		Old Pap didn't care to wait. We went up that mountain and surprised him. Whoeee you should
		have seen them rebels run. One of the biggest battles of the war if you ask me. We
		followed them right down the mountain, chased them clear out of Tennessee." His eyes
		took a faraway look as he relived old memories. "Was a damn stupid war if you ask me.
		Too many men dying for nothing."</p>

		<p>"It wasn't for nothing, Charles. You fought to keep the
		country together, to end slavery."</p>

		<p>"Pshaw, don't matter none now. Braxton's dead, Old Pap
		Thomas is dead, suppose I'll go soon too. Seventeen years I served the United States, what
		have I got to show for it? A run down shack in the middle of nowhere, dinner from a tin
		can, having to have a woman fix my roof." His voice was tinged with frustration and
		anger. Above them the steady sound of Josie pulling shingles echoed through. Charles
		looked at the picture on the mantle. "Oh Ruth, why'd you leave me?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca was at his side immediately, offering her shoulder for
		his tears. Time passed as she cradled him in her arms, the youth comforting the elder.
		Through his tears, he told her of the day he woke up to find his beloved lying next to him
		in eternal sleep. How he buried her beyond the cottonwoods. How his life changed from
		being happy and full to being empty and sad, and how he only wished now for a quick end to
		the loneliness. Rebecca cried with him, her sensitive nature not allowing otherwise. They
		passed the afternoon together, Charles sharing with her his life, reliving through his
		words all the good times he shared with his beloved Ruth, how they used to pass the
		evenings on the porch swing, looking at the stars and just being happy with each other's
		company. He told her of their journey across the country after his discharge from the
		Union army and how they lived in Boise City while he built their home. He spoke of Lillian
		and the many adventures that made up her childhood. By the time they heard Josie climb off
		the roof, Rebecca knew the sweet mans entire, colorful life and felt enriched for it.</p>

		<p>Josie set the crowbar down on the workbench in the barn along
		with the pile of good shingles. She was about to leave when she noticed the pile of
		firewood in the corner along with an ax. She stepped outside and looked again at the stack
		of cut wood. There was enough to last at least a week, but not much more. She rolled her
		shoulders, noting the stiffness, and decided that the wood could wait for another day.</p>

		<p>In an attempt to stretch their remaining food, Rebecca made a
		simple fare for dinner, mixing together the remainder of their bacon with some cans of
		Charles' beans and adding some molasses. As worn out and tired as Josie was, she still
		held the plate out for seconds, as did Charles. Rebecca kept an eye on the gunslinger,
		concerned that she might have pushed herself too hard. Her suspicions were confirmed when
		Josie asked for a third cup of water and winced noticeably when she reached up to take it
		from her.</p>

		<p>After dinner, Charles sat down with a fresh tin of tobacco and
		his rolling papers to make more cigarettes. To his surprise, Josie sat in the chair
		opposite him and Rebecca sat on the floor next to him and all three passed the evening
		converting the tin of tobacco into a tin of freshly rolled cigarettes. At first, every one
		Rebecca made either fell apart or didn't look anything like a cigarette. Noting her
		friend's frustration, Josie slipped out of the chair and sat down next to her. "Like
		this," she said, slowly showing her the proper way to roll. The gunslinger was a
		patient teacher, demonstrating time and time again until Rebecca got the hang of it. Only
		then did Josie get back up in the chair, sighing audibly when she leaned back into the
		overstuffed cushion.</p>

		<p>Rebecca entertained them with stories throughout the evening,
		pausing only to answer the multitude of questions posed to her from Charles, who had never
		heard the story of the battle of Saratoga before. Although Josie had heard the story
		before from Rebecca, she still sat there, drawn in by the young woman's vivid descriptions
		and animated voice. Even when all the tobacco was rolled they continued to sit there,
		refusing to move until the story was complete.</p>

		<p>Josie sat down on the edge of the bed and pulled her leg up to
		remove her boot. She didn't even realize that she had groaned until Rebecca knelt down in
		front of her. "Let me help," she said taking the boot in her hands and pulling.
		She repeated the process with the other boot before standing up. "Your back hurts,
		doesn't it?" Although spoken as a question, the young woman made it sound more like a
		statement. Josie nodded.</p>

		<p>"Guess I overdid it today," she admitted. Rebecca
		walked over to their saddlebags and rummaged around until she found the liniment. Josie
		smiled at the silent offer and quickly stripped down to her underdrawers while Rebecca
		changed into her nightgown. "You don't have to do this, you know," the
		gunslinger said as she lay down in the middle of the bed.</p>

		<p>"I know, but I want to," Rebecca said as she climbed up
		onto the bed. She hiked her nightgown up to her thighs and straddled Josie's hips.
		"This okay?"</p>

		<p>"Hang on a second." The gunslinger arched her back and
		lowered herself slowly, allowing her breasts to find a more comfortable position.
		"That's better."</p>

		<p>Rebecca very carefully poured a small amount of the liniment onto
		Josie's back and began to work it in gently. She ran her fingertips lightly over the
		muscled planes of her friend's back, adding more of the pungent liquid as necessary until
		her hands slid smoothly over the skin. She brought both hands to Josie's left shoulder and
		rubbed gently, eliciting a moan from the older woman. "I'm sorry, did I hurt
		you?"</p>

		<p>"Mmm, yeah, but don't stop. It feels good," the
		gunslinger mumbled. Rebecca smiled and continued her task. She focused her attention on
		each muscle, taking the time to thoroughly relax one before moving on to another. She
		moved from one shoulder to the other and repeated the process, noting from the moans and
		sharp intakes of air from Josie which muscles hurt more than others. She moved her body
		forward until she was on the small of the gunslinger's back, using her knees to help
		support most of her weight. The new position allowed her to use her thumbs to gently
		massage Josie's neck, every movement causing soft groans from the older woman. "Am I
		doing okay?"</p>

		<p>"Wonderful," the gunslinger murmured with a thin smile
		on her lips.</p>

		<p>At the first touch, her eyes closed involuntarily and remained
		that way.</p>

		<p>"You give wonderful backrubs."</p>

		<p>Rebecca smiled. "It's a good thing, too, considering the way
		you push yourself," She moved back onto Josie's hips and began to work her hands down
		the length of the gunslinger's back, alternating between a gentle caress with her palm to
		firm pressure with the heel of her hand. Every movement caused the dark headed woman to
		moan and sigh as the aches and pains of the day slowly disappeared. One by one the muscles
		relaxed under Rebecca's gentle touch. She ran her thumbs along the lines of Josie's ribs,
		stopping when she found a small round indentation that she had never felt before. Of
		course she never did such a thorough massage before, either. "What happened?"
		she said, her finger pressing on the indentation.</p>

		<p>"Hmm?", she picked her head up, disappointed that
		Rebecca had stopped until she realized what she was referring to. "Oh, nothing,
		happened a long time ago." She put her head back down and waited for the young woman
		to continue her glorious massage. When she didn't, Josie picked her head up again and
		twisted slightly, trying to look at the blonde woman in the dark. Gentle but firm hands
		pushed her back down.</p>

		<p>"What happened, Josie?"</p>

		<p>"Shot. Mmm....oh, right there...yessss." She closed her
		eyes again.</p>

		<p>"Nothing important. I got away and it wasn't that
		deep."</p>

		<p>"How many times have you been shot?" Rebecca asked as
		she continued the massage. Josie thought about it for a few moments before answering.</p>

		<p>"Four times...yeouch! Easy there."</p>

		<p>"Sorry." She eased up the pressure on the sensitive
		muscle.</p>

		<p>"This one, the time I was with you, and the night Genie
		died. What else?"</p>

		<p>"It's not important, Rebecca ...there...no, to the left a
		little...yeah."</p>

		<p>"Tell me," she gently prodded.</p>

		<p>"It's stupid. It was a long time ago, when I was
		younger."</p>

		<p>"Well of course you were younger. What happened? I'll stop
		rubbing your back if you don't tell me."</p>

		<p>"Fine." Josie let out an exasperated breath as she
		prepared herself for the inevitable. Why don't I win arguments with you, sprite? "I
		was fourteen and got hold of a gun that belonged to the hired man who worked for us."</p>

		<p>"You shot yourself?"</p>

		<p>"In the foot." Immediately Rebecca rolled off of her
		and pivoted to look at the gunslinger's feet. Sure enough, on the right foot near the big
		toe was a small bullet hole scar. She gently touched it with her fingertips.</p>

		<p>"That must've hurt something awful." Without thinking,
		Rebecca began to massage the ball of Josie's foot with her thumbs. She was rewarded with a
		deep groan. She rubbed again and received another lethargic groan. She sat cross- legged
		at the end of the bed. "Roll over."</p>

		<p>Josie complied and was treated to the utter bliss of having both
		of her normally aching feet massaged with the same tenderness that her back and shoulders
		received. No one had ever rubbed her feet before and she couldn't believe how nice it
		felt. With infinite care and gentleness, Rebecca pressed her thumbs into the callused skin
		while her fingers glided over the smooth tops of Josie's feet. Her hands traveled upward,
		past the ankles until she reached the well-defined calf muscles. She leaned over and
		retrieved the bottle of liniment. Josie realized what she was going to do and happily
		rolled back over without being asked. "Mmm...this is better than sex," she
		murmured. The fingers pressing into the backs of her legs suddenly stopped.</p>

		<p>"It is?" Rebecca asked. Josie chuckled and shook her
		head.</p>

		<p>"No, but it sure feels that way right now."</p>

		<p>"Oh," she said with a sigh of relief. She resumed her
		painstaking massage, working up until she reached Josie's knees. She looked at her
		friend's thighs, covered by her drawers. "Um...do you want...." She left the
		question unfinished.</p>

		<p>"No, that's okay, Rebecca. Your arms are probably getting
		tired by now anyway," Josie replied, sensing her friend's discomfort. "Besides,
		I've got ?it? right now."</p>

		<p>"Oh, okay," she replied, knowing that the gunslinger
		was lying.</p>

		<p>They'd been together long enough for her to know when it was
		Josie's time of the month, although it seemed like their times were getting closer to each
		other. "So tell me how you managed to shoot yourself in the foot, oh great and mighty
		gunfighter," she said as she moved up and straddled Josie's hips again, running her
		hands over her lower back.</p>

		<p>"Mmm...harder...it was nothing, just an accident...oh...ah,
		yup, right there."</p>

		<p>"Tell me," Rebecca said, deliberately easing up the
		pressure on Josie's muscles, teasing her by gliding her fingertips over them.</p>

		<p>"If I tell you will you continue?" She felt the
		slightest increase in the fingers on her skin. "I was playing with it, doing target
		practice. I had it down at my side, hammer cocked and my mother came out and caught
		me." Josie could feel her cheeks turning pink. "She screamed so loud that it
		startled me and I pulled the trigger." She felt the body on her rear tremble with
		unreleased laughter. "She was so mad that she grounded me for a month. Wasn't even my
		fault, she's the one that yelled."</p>

		<p>Rebecca lost control and laughed hysterically, rolling off the
		gunslinger and onto the bed. Only Josie's quick reflexes kept her from falling off the
		side. It took a few minutes for the young woman to get herself under control. "I keep
		seeing this little girl, all dressed in black and her mother coming out and chastising
		her," Rebecca chuckled. "Oh Josie, I just bet you were a handful when you were
		younger," she added as she rolled back onto the gunslinger and began her massage
		anew.</p>

		<p>"Hmm...I was." She closed her eyes and fell back into
		enjoying the younger woman's ministrations; so gentle, so caring. Josie was certain that
		no one had ever treated her this way before, so...so...she couldn't come up with a word to
		describe the tenderness that Rebecca put into each touch. Small hands left her back and
		she groaned in protest until she felt them on her upper arms, wet with a fresh application
		on liniment. She spread her arms out, giving the younger woman total access. With the same
		patience and thoroughness that Rebecca used on her back, feet, and legs, both her arms
		were massaged from shoulder to fingertips. While there was something scary about being so
		completely relaxed with another person, Josie still felt safe and protected, as if no harm
		could come to her as long as the gentle woman continued to touch her. She felt a sense of
		loss and regret when she felt Rebecca slide off her, although the blonde kept one hand on
		the small of her back.</p>

		<p>"How was that?" She asked softly.</p>

		<p>"Wonderful," Josie replied, rolling onto her side to
		look at her friend. Both women were propped up on their elbows facing each other.
		"You do that very nicely, thank you." She rolled her free shoulder and smiled.
		"You have no idea how good that feels."</p>

		<p>"I'm glad you liked it," Rebecca said, smiling. She
		hopped off the bed and pulled the blanket down as far as she could with the gunslinger
		still on the bed.</p>

		<p>"Hey, what about your backrub?" Josie asked, rising to
		her knees. "I can't let you give me the best rub down I've ever had and not return
		the favor." She laced her fingers together and cracked her knuckles in preparation.</p>

		<p>Rebecca sat down on the edge of the bed, put her hands in her
		lap, and looked down. "I don't think I want...I can't..." Her voice was so low
		that only someone with Josie's keen hearing could have heard. She knew immediately what
		was wrong.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." She moved closer and put her hand on the
		younger woman's shoulder, noting the tension. Josie cupped her chin, forcing the green
		eyes to look at her in the dim light of the moon coming through the window. "Do you
		trust me?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, of course I do," she said with conviction.
		"You know that."</p>

		<p>"Then trust me not to hurt you, Rebecca. You can't tell me
		that all that sweeping and dusting didn't give you sore muscles too." She released
		her hold on the younger woman's chin. "You trusted me to wash your back, trust me to
		do this."</p>

		<p>They sat there quietly for a minute while Rebecca made her
		decision. Without a word, she stood up and peeled off her nightgown. Josie stood and
		pulled the blankets back the rest of the way and waited for her to lie down before placing
		one knee on either side of Rebecca's waist and reaching for the liniment. Remembering how
		gently the younger woman had given her a massage, Josie imitated the motions, lightly
		running her fingers over Rebecca's back until it was covered with a thin layer of
		liniment.</p>

		<p>Josie worked slowly, letting her get used to the feeling of hands
		traveling over her back. "How are you doing?"</p>

		<p>"Okay," Rebecca said, her senses still alert to every
		movement. The taller woman continued to gently run her hands all over her back and
		shoulders, feeling the almost imperceptible relaxing of the muscles underneath. Josie made
		no attempt to deepen the pressure, seemingly content to just let her hands glide over the
		smooth skin. "How about now?"</p>

		<p>"Mmmmmhmm," was the mumbled reply. The gunslinger
		smiled and began to let her fingers seek out the bunched up and sore muscles. She marveled
		at the way Rebecca's body responded to her touch. Muscles that were tight and clenched
		relaxed completely under her manipulations. Her ears were rewarded with the softest of
		sighs as her hands continued to roam. She listened to Rebecca?s breathing deepen and
		become even followed by the softest of snores.</p>

		<p>Josie leaned back, making sure to keep her weight off the
		sleeping woman, and yawned. She was about to move off when she noticed a thin white scar
		illuminated by the pale moonlight. She let her finger lightly run the length of it before
		putting her hands on either side of Rebecca and bending down. She placed a gentle kiss;
		much like a mother would kiss a child's injury to make it feel better. "Goodnight
		sprite," she whispered before pulling the blankets up and lying down next to her
		friend. When she went to wrap her arm around Rebecca's waist, Josie felt the sensation of
		her breasts pressing up against bare skin. The last time she had been like this with
		Rebecca, it was pouring down buckets and didn't feel anywhere near as pleasant as it did
		at that moment. Josie snuggled closer, buried her face into the soft golden hair, and fell
		to sleep in seconds. Her last waking thought was of how nice it felt to hold someone. No,
		not just someone, she corrected herself. To hold Rebecca.</p>
