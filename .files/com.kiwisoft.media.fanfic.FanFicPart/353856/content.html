<!-- Changing Times \ Part 4 -->

<p>The next morning</p>
<p>Seven woke up to a multitude of sensations. Her head was still pounding
slightly, the edges of her memory fuzzy. /Have I been crying again?/ Her
body, which was nude, was curiously heavy and boneless. She knew she didn't
want to move, but she did anyhow. Immediately the arm around her waist
lifted and one hand cupped her breast. That movement caused seven to become
aware of the warm weight pressed against her right side. Carefully, Seven
looked around the room without moving, attempting to identify where she was.
A memory flashed to the surface, of being pressed against a way half dressed
while B'Elanna's tongue lazily roams across her breasts. Seven took a deep
breath, her nipples tightening from the memory and from the movement of
B'Elanna, pressing closer against her.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, on the edge of consciousness, moved closer to the woman she was
snuggled against. The woman. B'Elanna immediately sat up, grabbing the
sheet to cover her chest, &#034;I - I...&#034; Horrified, B'Elanna realized that
grabbing the sheet had caused it to slide down Seven's body until it pooled
at her waist; Seven's breasts were clearly visible, her hard rosy pink
nipples proudly displayed. B'Elanna felt a rush of moisture between her legs
as she saw Seven's nipples and smelt the spicy aroma of their sex the night
before. /How could I do this?/ &#034;Seven, I'm sorry.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven looked up at the Klingon. &#034;You are sorry? Why?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, it was inappropriate for this to happen.&#034; B'Elanna took a deep
breath.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven raised one eyebrow. &#034;it did not feel inappropriate.</p>
<p>&#034;It is, Seven. Even if it didn't feel inappropriate.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Because we are both female?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No, though in some cultures that would be a problem.&#034; B'Elanna sighed and
sat down on the edge of the bed. Reaching to the floor, she picked up and
put on her robe. Letting go of the sheet, B'Elanna looked at Seven. &#034;Pull
the sheet up and then we'll talk.&#034; B'Elanna took another deep breath as
Seven pulled the sheet up. Eyeing the newly covered area, B'Elanna couldn't
decide if it was an improvement or not. &#034;Seven, I feel like I took advantage
of you. You don't have any experience with.. in these matters.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You took advantage of me?&#034; Seven's eyebrows drew together as she considered
the night before.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, still not happy about it, slouched as she nodded. &#034;Yes.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;But I initiated our copulation.&#034;</p>
<p>This threw B'Elanna. She had assumed that *she* initiated the events of the
night before. Granted, she remembered Seven initiating them, but she had
dreamed about it so often she hadn't dare thought it real. &#034;What? Why?&#034;</p>
<p>Seven chose to answer only the latter question, as she had just answered the
first, &#034;I...&#034; Seven paused, trying to collect her thoughts. &#034;I wanted to
be close to you.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her chest constrict. &#034;Oh, Seven.. All you had to do was ask.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I did ask. That is how we ended up in your bed.&#034; Seven smiled slightly as
B'Elanna laughed.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, you did.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;What we did is no longer inappropriate?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No, Seven. Making love was never inappropriate. It was taking advantage of
you that was inappropriate.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I understand.&#034; Seven looked at B'Elanna. &#034;Since it is not inappropriate,
will you come back to bed?&#034; Seven looked and sounded hopeful.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled and immediately slid out of her robe. &#034;I'd love to.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;We do not have time to make love again.&#034; Seven's voice was laced with
disappointment.</p>
<p>&#034;It's ok, Seven. We can just hold each other and talk. We can even catch
another short nap.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Satisfactory.&#034; Seven moved form the middle of the bed, making room for
B'Elanna. She made too much room, though, since B'Elanna proceeded to lay
down with half her body draped over Seven's. Seven ran her left hand gently
up and down B'Elanna's back, the cool metal combining with the heat of
Seven's skin.</p>
<p>&#034;Mmm, that feels good, Seven.&#034; B'Elanna pressed closer to Seven, her leg
lifting and curling around Seven's lower body. B'Elanna's other leg lay
still, tangled in Seven's.</p>
<p>&#034;Does it always end like this, B'Elanna?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Like what?&#034; B'Elanna was getting drowsy, her words slowing down.</p>
<p>&#034;Does tragedy always end in happiness? If One hadn't lived and died, we
would not be together now.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Only if we're lucky, Seven. Only if we're lucky...&#034; With that, B'Elanna
drifted off to sleep, content in the arms of the woman she loved.</p>
