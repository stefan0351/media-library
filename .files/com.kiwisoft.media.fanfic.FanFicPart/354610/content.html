<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 5 -->

<p>David had made a few phone calls and went to his place to get a few
things. Xander was setting up the bar when David walked in.</p>
<p>"Xander, where's your boss?" David asked.</p>
<p>"I'm right here." said Jack, the owner who was coming out of the back
room. "What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to hold a function here tonight and I want an open bar." David
told Jack.</p>
<p>"I don't know, it's a bit short notice." Jack replied. David pulled out a
wad of notes and threw it to Jack. He looked down, amazed to see a wad of
hundred dollar bills.</p>
<p>"I want snacks and I want bar service. There are going to be quite a few
people here and they can order anything they want. If the money runs out come
and see me and I'll give you more."</p>
<p>Jack looked at David. "Buddy, you got your self a bar." he said.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The bar was packed. David and his friends had managed to get a good
number of the college students to come. Not to hard when there was free
drinks, Xander thought. David had brought in a CD player, explaining to
Xander "I heard the crap that came out of the jukebox here last night. So I
brought my own CD's. More appropriate music for the night."</p>
<p>Xander didn't know if it was appropriate music or not. He had never heard
of any of the bands but it was good music and the party was in full swing. As
a song finished David stopped the music, grabbed a guitar, and sat on the bar.</p>
<p>"OI! SHUT UP!!" David yelled. The bar fell silent.</p>
<p>"Right, now that I've got your attention I've got a couple of things that
need to be said. Today is ANZAC Day, a day which Australians remember all
those who fell in war and those who returned. It is also a day for much
drinking." A cheer from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Anyway I've got a song I'd like to share with you. It's a song about a
survivor of the first ANZAC Day at Gallipoli in 1915, the baptism of fire for
a young nation. So here goes." David began to play the guitar.</p>

<p align=center>Now when I was a young lad I carried me pack<br>
And I lived the free life of the rover.<br>
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback<br>
Well I waltzed my matilda all over</p>

<p align=center>Then in 1915, my country said son<br>
It's time you stopped ramblin' there's work to be done<br>
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun<br>
And they marched me away to the war.</p>

<p align=center>And the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
As the ship pulled away from the quay<br>
And admidst all the cheers, flag waving and tears<br>
We sailed of for Gallipoli.</p>

<p align=center>And how well I remember that terrible day<br>
How our blood stained the sand and the water<br>
And how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay<br>
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.</p>

<p align=center>Jonny Turk, he was waiting, he'd primed himself well<br>
He showered us with bullets and he rained us with shells<br>
And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell.<br>
Nearly blew us right back to Australia.</p>

<p align=center>But the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
When we stopped to bury our slain.<br>
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs<br>
And we started all over again.</p>

<p align=center>Well those that were left, we tried to survive<br>
In that mad world of blood, death and fire.<br>
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive<br>
Though around me the corpses piled higher.</p>

<p align=center>Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head<br>
And when I woke up in my hospital bed<br>
And I saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead<br>
Never knew there was worse things than dying.</p>

<p align=center>For I'll roam no waltzing matilda<br>
All around the green bush farm free.<br>
To hump the tent pegs, a man needs both legs<br>
No more waltzing matilda for me.</p>

<p align=center>So they gathered the cripple, the wounded, the maimed<br>
And they shipped us back home to Australia.<br>
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane<br>
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla.</p>

<p align=center>And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay<br>
I looked at the place where me legs used to be<br>
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me<br>
To greave, to mourn, and to pity.</p>

<p align=center>But the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
As they carried us down the gangway.<br>
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared<br>
And then they turned all their faces away.</p>

<p align=center>So now every April I sit on me porch<br>
And I watch the parade pass before me.<br>
And I see my old comrades how proudly they march<br>
Reviving old dreams of pass glories.</p>

<p align=center>And the old men march slowly, their old bones stiff and sore<br>
They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war<br>
And the young people ask 'What are they marching for?'<br>
And I ask myself the same question.</p>

<p align=center>But the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
And the old men still answer the call<br>
But as year follows year, more old men disappear<br>
Some day no one will march there at all.</p>

<p align=center>Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda<br>
who'll come a waltzing matilda with me?<br>
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong<br>
Who'll come a waltzing matilda with me?</p>

<p>There was a very sombre silence in the bar. David looked up to see the
faces of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Anyway, enough of that. Johnno! Music please. Let's get pissed!" David
cried out to the cheers of the crowd. The festive mood returned and David
jumped off the bar.</p>
<p>"Xander!" David yelled over the music. "Another beer please!" Xander gave
David another beer.</p>
<p>"You do remember that you've got a session with Buffy tomorrow morning?"
Xander reminded David. "You keep drinking like that Willow will be able to
kick the shit out of you."</p>
<p>"Xander, mate, don't worry. I think I'll be able to handle Buffy."</p>
<p>"Riley said the same thing just before Buffy kicked him 20 feet across
the room." Xander informed him.</p>
<p>"Look, after tomorrow's session I'll explain everything to you and Giles.
OK?" David said and wandered back to the crowd. Xander liked David. They
shared the same sense of humour, David was a friendly guy who struck Xander
as an older brother type of person.</p>
<p>As the night went on David and Xander became good friends. It was good to
have someone to laugh with and share funny stories. David was the first male
friend Xander had since Jesse died and as such Xander was worried that Buffy
would paste David in the morning. But every time that Xander expressed his
concern David was very casual about it.</p>
<p>When the function was over, David said good night to Jack and Xander and
started to walk home. He hadn't gone too far when a voice hissed out "Hand
over your cash!" David looked around only to see a man holding a large knife.</p>
<p>"You're kidding! You realise how dangerous it is to be out at night,
here?" David exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Just give me your money or I'll slice you open." the mugger said. With
lightning speed David grabbed the muggers knife hand and slammed his other
hand into the muggers elbow. There was a sickening sound of bones snapping
and the mugger cried out in agony, dropping the knife. David then kicked the
mugger in the chest, breaking ribs and sending him flying across the alley.
The mugger smashed into the wall and collapsed into a heap on the ground,
unconscious and bleeding. David looked at the mugger.</p>
<p>"Told you it was dangerous here." David said to the unconscious form.
David then turned and walked away.</p>
<p>"Maybe a vamp will get your sorry ass." David muttered as he left the
alley.</p>
