<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 13 -->

<p>"Is there somewhere that we can speak?" the Abbot asked. "I do not wish
to be rude, but there are some things that are only for the three of you
can divulge to anyone else." </p>

<p>"Of course Abbot." Giles said indicating the door to his study. "We can
speak in my study. I'm sure everyone can calm themselves enough for
that." </p>

<p>The Abbot followed Giles with a very wary Willow and Buffy not far
behind. The girls sat together on the love seat, while Giles sat in a
large overstuffed easy chair, turning his desk and chair over to the
Abbot. </p>

<p>The older man laid a large wooden case on the desk. Buffy studied the
case and was fascinated by the intricately carved and obviously ancient
case and wondered what it could possibly contain of interest to them. </p>

<p>She knew that Willow wasn't comfortable with these people and so she was
naturally suspicious because her friend was the one that saw the good in
every one. If her Wills didn't trust these guys than Buffy resolved that
she'd watch their every move. </p>

<p>The Abbot sat back in the comfortable desk chair and let out a heavy
sigh of both relief and exhaustion. </p>

<p>"I am getting too old for this." the elderly cleric said smiling wearily
at Giles. "This running around the world is a young persons game. I am
only glad to have lived long enough to see the culmination of my lifes
dream and to finally be able to carry out the duties of my office of
Abbot."
"What's your dreams and duties got to do with me and Wills?" Buffy asked
not sure she wanted the answer. </p>

<p>"You Slayer." the Abbot said locking eyes with the young blonde. "You
and your beloved little witch are my lifes work. It's what I and my
predecessors have lived and worked secretly for over three hundred
years.
Our duty is to help the Slayer and the Sorceress fulfil their destiny
and, God willing, begin to pay back a debt long past due." </p>

<p>He paused for a moment to be sure he had the attention of everyone in
the room before continuing. </p>

<p>"You must understand when the errors of our predecessors were
discovered, the Holy Father at the time was appalled and was determined
to make it right." the Abbots deep slightly accented voice helped his
listeners to relax and absorb his narrative. "In an effort to see that
the Church and its representatives did their duty, that Pope and every
one since has maintained a secret order of a few dedicated individuals
to gather, keep, and preserve all the records, legends, and artifacts we
could gather pertaining to the Sisters and keep them in trust for this
time.
Over the generations our brothers have searched and waited keeping an
eye on the Watchers Council and their Slayers knowing it was only a
matter of time until the Slayer and her Sorceress of their time would be
joined, thus renewing the ancient sect.
Many times it came close but the Slayer usually died before destiny
could join her with her Sorceress. It was as if someone or something was
trying to kill them off to keep destiny from joining.
When it was reported that the two of you had met early and when we
learned this Slayer had lived past her 18th birthday we were further
encouraged because you my dear are the first to do so and it appears
that you are truly destiny's chosen ones." </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow looked at each other and gasped in awe at what they'd
just learned and the ramifications it carried. For the first time they
realized that Buffy and Willow were the Chosen Ones, not just Buffy.
They both were relieved that now some of the weight destiny had placed
on Buffys shoulders would now be shared by the two of them. </p>

<p>Buffy knew that for the first since becoming the Slayer she was never
going to be alone again. With his words the Abbot had confirmed
everything they had learned from Brigit and Morrigan. It really was
destiny that brought them together. </p>

<p>Not everyone was relieved by the Abbots words, everything that Giles
knew and believed was shaken to the core by the truth revealed by the
Abbots history lessons. Giles knew the rest of the truth behind the
failure of the Slayers' premature deaths, and he knew why his Slayer was
the exception. </p>

<p>"The test." Giles whispered, horrified by his revelation and the
treachery of his own organization. "Those bastards were so afraid of
losing their control over the Slayers they murdered them so they
couldn't be joined and become independent.
If I had followed orders blindly like the rest they would have made me
an accomplice in Buffys murder.
All their high and mighty talk and the marvellous ideals they preached,
all CRAP!" </p>

<p>Giles slammed his fist down on the desk as he roared those last words.
He leapt from his chair and began pacing the floor of his study. His
rage was becoming a living thing feeding on his outrage and grief as his
world fell apart around him. </p>

<p>Before he'd thought that only a few individuals were responsible for the
problems and inconsistences he'd come across, but now he knew the entire
council was corrupt from its very foundations. </p>

<p>He was lost. For the first time in his life he questioned his reasons
for living. As if reading his mind Willow reached out and caught the
agitated man as he past her. </p>

<p>She pulled him over to stand in front of her and Buffy and waited until
he looked into her eyes, then she began to comfort the man she had come
to consider a father to herself and the person she loved most in the
world. </p>

<p>"Giles please don't blame yourself." Willow said her voice soft and
warm, wrapping around his raging spirit like a comforting blanket and
stilling his anger. "You are the finest most honorable man we've ever
known. You have always dealt fairly and honestly with all of us, and
more importantly you have always followed your conscience even, when it
cost you dearly. You've always put Buffy and her welfare ahead of
everything else.
When the council tried to set her up and ordered you to drug her you did
everything you could to thwart them. You are the single most important
reason my Buffy is alive to be with me today.
For that alone how can we help but love you and forgive any mistakes you
may have made because you trusted men who lied and manipulated you." </p>

<p>"Yeah Giles-y, what she said." Buffy said trying to lighten the mood. "I
mean it's like your my Dad, and what Dad hasn't screwed up raising their
kid because they listened to some idiot that tried to tell them how to
do their job. So do what other dads do.
Admit your mistake, say you're sorry and GET OVER IT! So deal okay.
Now I think the Abbot-guy has some more to tell us and I don't think I
got time. Remember I'm gettin' married tomorrow and the little spitfire
I'm gettin' hitched to isn't gonna take any excuses from you or me for
being late." </p>

<p>Giles looked down at the two girls and was overcome with emotion. He
fell to his knees and hugged both of them. Then realizing what he was
doing he blushed at his lack of control. </p>

<p>He straightened up removed his glasses and began cleaning them as he
went back to his seat. </p>

<p>"You are quite correct Buffy." the Watcher said. "I am sorry for the
interruption, please continue father, it won't happen again." </p>

<p>The Abbot sat quietly for a moment reflecting on what Giles had said and
the trust displayed by the two girls. He was more than a little
surprised at the closeness shared by these three and was glad that they
had each other. His studies and experiences had shown him how important
that could be. </p>

<p>"What you say about the Watchers Council would explain much." the Abbot
said as he absorbed the gist of what had been said. "It would also
explain their very active role in the witch hunts." </p>

<p>"I hope you wouldn't try to divert attention from the role your own
people played in the atrocities during the Burning Times priest." Willow
snapped sarcastically. "I imagine they simply followed your example,
they just never stopped. They do however have valid reasons to fear the
Sorceress. When we have time I'm sure we'll get around to what to do
about the council and their role in all this." </p>

<p>That statement left the room with an ominous silence until the full
impact of what had been said hit Buffy like a ton of bricks. </p>

<p>"Okay you mean that the reason the Council tried to get me killed was to
keep me and Wills from getting together." Buffy blurted out suddenly
outraged. "Why those...those...those not nice guys...they...I ought
to...that's just...that's just about the funniest thing I ever heard." </p>

<p>Buffy started laughing so hard it hurt and tears were streaming from her
eyes, then she noticed that the others were looking at her like she'd
lost her mind. Buffy straightened up and tried to explain. </p>

<p>"I just thought about all the sneakiness and hateful things they've done
to us, just to keep me and Wills apart. All they did was bring us closer
together, and drive a good man away from them, and give me a Dad." Buffy
smiled mischievously at the two people. "Oh boy I bet someone is really
pissed at somebody for that foul up. I suppose when this is over we
really should send the Council a note of thanks for helping us get
together.
What do ya' say Wills, you want to write it or should I?" </p>

<p>Willow broke out laughing at the thought of the look on the faces of the
council when they received that particular piece of correspondence. When
she shared her thoughts with the ex-Watcher he too had to chuckle and
asked to help compose it, which caused all three of them to break out in
laughter again. </p>

<p>The Abbot watched the easy and natural camaraderie displayed by the
Watcher and his two charges. Being in his position he knew how rare and
valuable such closeness was when facing the unknown dangers these people
shared every day. </p>

<p>He hated to interrupt but he had a lot to take care of and limited time
in which to do it. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt but I really must get this done before we leave
for the confrontation we face tonight." the Abbot sighed. Then he sat up
and, after pushing some hidden latches on the wooden case, the Abbot
opened it. "As we are instructed by prophecy when the Slayer and the
Sorceress come together, the artifacts gathered in their names shall be
returned to them, so I believe these belong to you."
He turned the open case around to show its contents to the two girls.
Buffy and Willow craned their necks to see into the case and gaped at
what they saw. </p>

<p>The case contained a large collection of wood, crystal, and silver items
along with some well maintained leather gauntlets with long sharp silver
spikes. </p>

<p>They could feel the power and history of the items calling to them.
There were also several sealed bottles and vials of powders and liquids
that radiated their metaphysical strength, even Giles could feel the
power that was contained in the case the Abbot had just presented to the
girls. </p>

<p>"I am not an expert in the meanings and uses of all of these items, that
is Jeffreys area of expertise." the Abbot explained as he picked up two
amulets on silver chains. "These two however I have reserved to give to
you myself, as has every one that has held my office." </p>

<p>He walked around the desk to the love seat where the two girls sat
watching him intently. The first amulet was a crystal and silver swan. </p>

<p>This one he handed to Willow as she held it the amulet took on a
pulsating green light that pulsed in time with the young witchs
heartbeat. </p>

<p>"This is for you to give to your beloved." he told her his voice
reflecting the reverence and respect he had for the small ceremony that
was about to take place. "It is the symbol of your love and commitment
to her and a token of your promise to protect her always and to remain
at her side to share her joys and sorrows for the span of your lives." </p>

<p>Willow locked eyes with the old priest and she could see the deep
emotion he was feeling and finally understood the true meaning behind
his actions. He was truly happy for the two girls and was giving their
union the closest thing to a blessing the tenets of his religion would
allow. </p>

<p>She smiled up at him and nodded her consent as a single tear fell down
her cheek. </p>

<p>The old man turned to Buffy and put a delicate looking crystal rose
amulet in her hand, it was soon glowing with a bluish white light that
pulsed in time with the Slayer's heartbeat. </p>

<p>"Since the beginning of know records, the single white rose has been the
symbol of the Slayer." he began. Buffy and Willow gasped when they
realized that Buffy had always favored white roses. "This is for you to
give to your beloved Sorceress as a symbol of your love and commitment
and a token of your vow to protect and cultivate her soul.
It also is a notice to all creatures that she is the mate of the Slayer
that to assault her is to incur the wrath of the Slayer, something even
the most powerful minions of the dark would think twice about." </p>

<p>"Thank you." Buffy whispered, in awe of what the old Abbot had just told
her. </p>

<p>"Over the years I have found that love and trust like you two have for
each other is a rare and precious find where ever you find it." the
Abbot told the girls seriously. "Many of my own colleagues would
disagree with me even to the point of condemnation and excommunication.
Even the Church can not publicly support you. Privately however is
another story. Before we leave this place both you and your watcher will
be given several diverse methods of contacting our order. We are
authorized to provide with any and all the support you need, all the
resources of the Church are available to us.
Then there is of course Brother Jeffrey, he will be available to you at
any time. I think you will find him to be an intelligent and reasonably
liberal thinking man and he is well educated in other religions." </p>

<p>The old Abbot looked down at the two young people and was touched by the
love and respect they openly held for each other. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;They are lucky to have each other.&lt;&gt; the old cleric thought,
considering the terrors they faced on a daily basis. &lt;&gt;No one should
have to face that alone.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Realizing how late it was getting he decided to move right on to the
next part of his reason for being there in person. </p>

<p>"It is time for the rest of the purpose of my visit." the Abbot said
with quiet reverence. "There is a small ceremony that is not mentioned
in any of the reference material, the reason being our order removed
it." </p>

<p>"How dare you presume...." Willow started to protest, but the Abbot held
up
his hand </p>

<p>"Please before you condemn us let me explain, please Sorceress." he
asked her and when she nodded her consent, he continued. "Yes I will
admit we removed it for selfish reasons. After everything our
predecessors did, we wanted to reserve this one thing to be our gift, so
to speak. To prove our sincerity and, to be honest, every Abbot since
the conception of our order has reserved this for themselves." </p>

<p>His only hope was that the two young people in front of him would
understand and accept his explanation.</p>
