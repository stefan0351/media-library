<p><b>A/N: I apologize for taking so long to get this update out... I'm not sure why, but this chapter really challenged me. Anyway, a big thank you once again to everyone for reading and reviewing my story, and I hope you're still enjoying it :) Oh, and 'Mammoth Orange' isn't my own creation - it's a real place (or was) in Chowchilla, California. I just sort of transplanted it to Pine Ridge for my story :)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">YOU AND ME</p>
<p>"Daddy!" Miley gasped. "H-how long have you been standing there?" Her heart was beating wildly, her father's sudden appearance and the grim tone of his voice startling her more than she cared to admit.</p>
<p>"Long enough," Robbie Ray replied calmly. "Is there something you wanna tell me, bud?"</p>
<p>"I guess that depends on how much you saw," Miley answered sheepishly. She felt Lilly playfully elbow her.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm pretty sure I just saw my daughter and her best friend kissing each other… and not a friendly little kiss either," Robbie Ray said softly.</p>
<p>"Um, y-yeah…" Miley managed. She flashed Lilly a quick, desperate look, but her best friend turned girlfriend didn't have any idea how to answer her father's question either. In the end, she decided the only way she could answer was with the truth.</p>
<p>"You, um… you saw right, daddy," Miley said slowly. "Lilly & I… we're in love."</p>
<p>"I swear I'd never hurt her, Mr. S," Lilly added, jumping to her feet to stand beside Miley. Without really thinking about it, she took Miley's hand in her own, a small, tender gesture meant to convey her love and support.</p>
<p>"I know you wouldn't, Lilly," Robbie Ray responded, finally smiling a little. "You've always been there for Miley… and I certainly trust you more than I ever would any boy."</p>
<p>"W-wait a minute," Miley stammered. "Daddy, are you… are you saying you're okay with this? I mean, with Lilly & I?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I be, bud?" Robbie Ray answered warmly. "I'm not so close-minded I can't see when my daughter's happy. I just wanted you to be honest with me about it." Miley blinked.</p>
<p>"Even though Lilly and I are both… you know… girls?" she asked carefully. Robbie Ray smiled and reached out to gently tousle his daughter's long brown hair.</p>
<p>"Bud… I'm not blind. I've seen how close you and Lilly have become, and I think a part of me has always half expected you two to end up together. As long as you're happy, so am I." He grinned then.</p>
<p>"It <i>was</i> kinda fun watching you squirm for a minute, though," he chuckled. Miley's eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>"You mean this whole time… that's just mean, daddy!" she gasped. She walked over to him and not-quite-seriously punched him in the arm.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you did that!" Miley exclaimed, trying hard not to smile. "You're bad, you know that?"</p>
<p>"I know, bud," Robbie Ray said with a smile. "Havin' a sense of humor is how I stay sane being a single father." He grew serious again for a moment.</p>
<p>"You know I'll always love you, Miles, no matter what… you'll always be my little girl, and nothing can ever change that."</p>
<p>"Oh, daddy…" Miley whispered, tears stinging her eyes. She wrapped her arms around her father in a warm hug. "I swear, you must like makin' me cry!" Robbie Ray laughed softly.</p>
<p>"Only good tears, I promise," he said with a smile. He looked over at Lilly then, who was standing a respectful distance away. "I promise I won't bite, Lilly; there's plenty of room over here for you too." Smiling, Lilly walked over and gratefully joined in the hug.</p>
<p>"I love you both," Robbie Ray said softly to the two young women in his arms. "All I ask is that you take care of each other, okay?" Miley and Lilly looked at each other and smiled.</p>
<p>"We will, daddy," Miley answered for both of them. "We will."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Later that night, Miley and Lilly snuggled together in her bed, happily sharing their first moments together as a couple. Everyone else in the Stewart home had long since gone to sleep, but the two friends remained awake – and in each other's arms – talking the night away.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe all this is happening," Miley said happily. "All this time I thought I was going crazy… and now I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life." Lilly grinned and gave Miley a quick peck on the lips.</p>
<p>"I feel the same way, Miles," she whispered. "I never thought I could be this happy with anyone."</p>
<p>"Really?" Miley asked quietly, her heart swelling.</p>
<p>"Really," Lilly promised, reaching up to slowly brush a few loose curls away from Miley's face, staring lovingly into her eyes.</p>
<p>"I feel like I'm gonna melt when you do that," Miley managed.</p>
<p>"When I do what?" Lilly asked, still smiling.</p>
<p>"When you look at me that way," Miley said softly, smiling shyly.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Lilly responded with a widening smile, her tone making it clear she wasn't sorry at all. "Can I help it if I like looking at you?" Miley felt herself blush slightly.</p>
<p>"I guess I can live with that," she said warmly. "As long as you're the only one who looks at me like that." Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>
<p>"So where do we, y'know… go from here?" Miley asked quietly, finding Lilly's other hand beneath the covers and taking it in her own.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Lilly replied.</p>
<p>"Well, do you want to tell the rest of our families?" Miley asked her.</p>
<p>"My mother <i>is</i> the rest of my family," Lilly quipped, laughing slightly.</p>
<p>"You know what I meant, silly," Miley said with a small laugh of her own.</p>
<p>"Yes, I want to tell my mom," Lilly continued. "I know she'll be happy for us!"</p>
<p>"I hope so," Miley replied hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Trust me," Lilly said warmly, squeezing Miley's hand.</p>
<p>"With my life," Miley answered softly. For a long moment, she and Lilly just laid there together, staring into each other's eyes. Then a wide smile lit up Miley's face.</p>
<p>"Hey Lils… let's go out tomorrow!" she said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Like, to a movie?" Lilly asked, not quite understanding. Miley shook her head.</p>
<p>"I was thinking more like a date," Miley said earnestly. "Nothin' fancy, maybe just a burger & fries at Mammoth and some putt-putt golf at Golf N' Stuff. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"That sounds great," Lilly said happily. "Do you think you can get your dad to drop us off?"</p>
<p>"I'll ask him in the morning, but I'm sure he will," Miley replied with a smile.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"Morning, daddy."</p>
<p>"Mornin', bud," Robbie Ray called out cheerfully, looking up as Miley and Lilly walked into the kitchen of the Stewart home. "So what do you ladies have planned for today?"</p>
<p>"Well, after breakfast I think we're going to try and talk to Lilly's mom," Miley said carefully. She knew her father would know what she was talking about without having to elaborate.</p>
<p>"I'm sure she'll be fine with it, bud," Robbie Ray said warmly, sliding a couple of fried eggs out of the frying pan he was holding and onto a waiting plate.</p>
<p>"We think so too," Miley replied with a smile. "Later though, we were um… wondering if maybe you could give us a ride into town."</p>
<p>"I think that could be arranged," Robbie Ray responded with a smile, handing his daughter and her girlfriend each a plate of hot breakfast. "What's the occasion?"</p>
<p>"Well, actually… we kinda wanted to go out on a date," Miley said quietly.</p>
<p>"A date, huh?" Jackson's voice called out. He sauntered into the kitchen, looking like he'd slept in his clothes… again. "Who're the lucky guys I need to threaten?" he asked as he opened the refrigerator door, searching for something to drink.</p>
<p>"Actually, Jackson, there um... aren't any guys," Miley said softly.</p>
<p>"I thought you just said you were going on a date?" Jackson asked, looking back at his sister with a puzzled expression on his face.</p>
<p>"She's going on a date with <i>me</i>, Jackson," Lilly said carefully. "Miley and I are kinda… together now." Jackson blinked.</p>
<p>"What?" he asked blankly. Miley swallowed as a terrible feeling of dread settled in the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>"Lilly and I… we're girlfriends now, Jackson," she said slowly. "I'm sorry we didn't tell you before, it really just happened last night…"</p>
<p>"You're joking, right?" Jackson interrupted her, frowning darkly.</p>
<p>"No, she's being serious Jackson," Lilly spoke up, a slight edge to her voice. She didn't like the way Miley's older brother seemed to be acting at all.</p>
<p>"Miley, she's a… Lilly's a girl! You both are!" Jackson exclaimed, completely ignoring Lilly.</p>
<p>"What does that have to do with anything?" Lilly snapped, feeling her temper rise.</p>
<p>"<i>Everything</i>!" Jackson shouted at her. "Do you know what everyone says about… about people like <i>you</i>?"</p>
<p>"Son," Robbie Ray spoke up, his voice booming. "That was uncalled for. You apologize to your sister and Lilly right now."</p>
<p>"Dad… did you know about this?" Jackson continued, not even bothering to acknowledge the reprimand.</p>
<p>"They told me last night," Robbie Ray responded calmly. "Why?"</p>
<p>"What did you say?" Jackson pressed.</p>
<p>"I told Miley and Lilly I was happy for them," Robbie Ray replied, refusing to back down. "You should be too."</p>
<p>"No," Jackson answered, his voice tight. "I… I can't." Swallowing, he turned to look at his little sister, then at Lilly, searching their faces for… something.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry… but I just can't deal with this right now!" Not even bothering to close the refrigerator door, Jackson turned and ran, dropping the now empty carton of orange juice he had been holding. A few moments later the sound of the front door slamming closed echoed through the house. Lilly was furious, though she could've cared less what Jackson thought of her at the moment; she was angry at how he had treated his own sister, and she felt her own protective instincts roar into overdrive.</p>
<p>"Miles, I…" She turned to look at Miley, ready to let her girlfriend know just what she thought about her brother's behavior, but the instant she saw the heartbroken expression on her Miley's face, all her anger just faded away.</p>
<p>"Did you see the way he looked at me?" Miley whispered, her voice breaking. "He's my brother… and he acted like he didn't even recognize me." She sagged into Lilly's waiting arms as tears began to streak down her face, sobs already shaking her body.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"Hey," Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>"W-where…?" a still half-asleep Miley struggled to ask. Looking around carefully, she saw she was lying on her living room couch, wrapped in Lilly's protective arms.</p>
<p>"You're still lying on the couch," Lilly replied softly. "You finally cried yourself to sleep, so I just stayed here and held you."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Miley managed.</p>
<p>"You don't have anything to be sorry for, Miles," Lilly responded. "You didn't do a thing wrong. If anyone should be apologizing, it's your brother." The moment she saw the flash of pain on her girlfriend's face, Lilly immediately regretted brining up Jackson at all.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Lilly said sheepishly. "Now <i>I'm</i> the one who should be apologizing." Miley shook her head.</p>
<p>"For what? Being there for me when I needed you the most… like you always have?" Miley smiled shyly. "Whatever happens Lilly, I promise, I'll always love you. Nothing and no one's gonna stop that… not even Jackson." Feeling tears threatening to spill from her own eyes, Lilly pulled Miley into a fierce hug.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miley… so much."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to see you two are doing okay," Robbie Ray's amused voice cut in.</p>
<p>"Hey, daddy," Miley greeted him shyly. "Lilly and I were just…"</p>
<p>"It's okay, bud; you don't have to hide around me. As long as I don't catch you doin' something that's gonna embarrass us both," he added with a grin.</p>
<p>"<i>Da-ad</i>!" Miley whined. "Lilly and I haven't even been together a full day yet!" Robbie Ray chuckled.</p>
<p>"Just teasin', darlin'," he said with a grin. He sat down on the couch carefully, Miley and Lilly shifting slightly to give him room.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about your brother, bud," Robbie Ray said solemnly. "Just give him some time… I know he'll come around."</p>
<p>"I hope so," Miley whispered sadly.</p>
<p>"Do you two still want to go out tonight?" Robbie Ray asked. "After everything that's happened, I wouldn't blame you if you changed your mind… but I think it might do you some good to get out of the house."</p>
<p>"It's up to you, Miles," Lilly said softly. "I'll do whatever you want."</p>
<p>"Daddy?" Miley asked him carefully. "Do you think there'll be others… who'll act like Jackson did?" Robbie Ray considered the question for a long moment.</p>
<p>"I hate to say it, but there might be," he admitted. "I'd like to think the people of this town aren't that close-minded, but I can't promise anything."</p>
<p>"We don't have to go out if you don't want to, Miles," Lilly said quickly. "I don't want to see you hurt again."</p>
<p>"What about you, Lils?" Miley asked her, "Would it bother you?"</p>
<p>"Is there anything someone might say that would make you not want to be with me?" Lilly replied with a question of her own. Miley emphatically shook her head.</p>
<p>"Not a chance," she said quickly. "I won't lie and say it wouldn't hurt, 'cause it might, but… I'm not giving you up for anything, Lilly; or anyone." Lilly smiled and leaned forward to capture Miley's lips in a sweet kiss.</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> still sitting here you know," Robbie Ray teased.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Lilly apologized, blushing slightly as she pulled away from Miley.</p>
<p>"Just don't make a habit of doing that when I'm around, and we'll be fine," Robbie Ray joked. "Anyway, I want you girls to know you'll always have a place here, okay? Anyone has a problem with you two being together, they'll have to deal with me."</p>
<p>"Thank you, daddy," Miley said, smiling despite the joyful tears she felt beginning to sting her eyes. "Haven't I cried enough for one day, though?" Robbie Ray laughed.</p>
<p>"All right bud, I'll stop," he said with a grin. "If you still want to go out, just let me know. I'll be happy to take you both wherever you want to go."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A little while later, as everyone in the little town of Pine Ridge began to get ready for dinner time, Robbie Ray drove Miley and Lilly to a popular local hangout known as 'Mammoth Burger' to start their date.</p>
<p>"Thanks, daddy," Miley said warmly as she and Lilly climbed out of the car. "We'll call you when we're ready to go home, okay?"</p>
<p>"No problem, darlin'," Robbie Ray replied with a smile. "Have fun… and be careful."</p>
<p>"We will, Mr. S," Lilly said, smiling back. They closed the car door and waved as Robbie Ray drove away.</p>
<p>"Well, it's just us now," Lilly said warmly, squeezing Miley's hand.</p>
<p>"Yeah, just us and the rest of Pine Ridge," Miley joked, noticing the crowd of other teenagers at the popular take-out restaurant. Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"I'm still glad you decided to go out," she replied.</p>
<p>"Me too, Lils," Miley said with a smile. They had decided they were not going to try and hide the fact they were together, but they <i>were</i> going to be somewhat careful, just in case. Hand in hand, they walked up to the restaurant together.</p>
<p>As its name suggested, 'Mammoth Orange' was shaped like a gigantic orange, with a small counter and window in the front where customers could put in and pick up their orders. It was connected to a large white building just behind it, with a huge 'Mammoth Orange' logo on it in big white and orange letters. Several large wooden picnic tables had been set up in the front and to the sides of the big orange itself, now crowded with people enjoying their food and each other.</p>
<p>"What do you feel like tonight, Lils?" Miley asked her girlfriend as they walked up to the window.</p>
<p>"I was thinking about a double cheeseburger, but maybe I should be a little more ladylike tonight, huh?" Lilly quipped, Miley grinned at her.</p>
<p>"You can have anything you want, Lils," she said softly. "I love you just the way you are."</p>
<p>"Awww… now who's trying to melt who?" Lilly whispered. Miley winked, and they shared a quick kiss. Reaching the window, Miley ordered double cheeseburgers and vanilla shakes for each of them, and an order of large fries to share. After they paid and got their food, they found a mostly empty table in the corner to sit down at and enjoy their dinner together.</p>
<p>"Thanks for dinner, Miles," Lilly said as she tore into her burger with relish.</p>
<p>"You're welcome, Lils," Miley replied, sipping her milkshake. "Thank you for being with me." Lilly looked up at Miley, smiling and blushing politely despite her mouthful of food. Swallowing it all, with some effort, she reached over the table and took Miley's hand in her own again.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miles," she said softly. For a long moment they simply stared at each other, each shyly enjoying taking in the sight of the young woman who had stolen their heart. Then, abruptly, Lilly stood up and walked over to sit beside Miley.</p>
<p>"I like it better here," she explained with a grin. Their hands found each other again underneath the table.</p>
<p>"Me too," Miley whispered back. Leaning in, she kissed Lilly gently. Their lips stayed together for several long moments.</p>
<p>"We should probably behave ourselves," Miley teased when they finally parted.</p>
<p>"I could <i>so</i> get used to that," Lilly breathed, a wide smile lighting up her face. Miley giggled.</p>
<p>"Me too, Lils; me too."</p>
