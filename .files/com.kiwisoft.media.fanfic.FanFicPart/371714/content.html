<p style="text-align:center;">Chapter Seven: Zombie Slayers Have Plans.</p>
<p><b>Smiley has signed in…</b></p>
<p><b>ZombieeSlayaa has signed in…</b></p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> Hey Miley.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Hi.</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> So you ready to tell Lilly you like her?</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> I guess…I'm just not sure.</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> No sure of what?</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Well…</p>
<p><b>Skatergirl has signed in…</b></p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> I'm afraid that when I open my big mouth and blurt out my feelings for Lilly that when she doesn't return them, that I'll have ruined our friendship because of my selfish need to tell her.</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> But what if she liked you back?</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Then I'd be overjoyed.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> But what are the chances she will? I mean I'm a girl and she's a girl. How is that supposed to work out?</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> And well, you liked me and I don't like you back and…well yeah.</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> Yea, but I still want to be your friend because if I can't be with you, then being friends with you and seeing you happy with someone else it the same</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Awww, that's really sweet of you!</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> It's like I've been saying all along. I'm really not that bad of a person.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Whatever you say Ego-Boy.</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> So how would you phrase it when you tell Lilly?</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Umm, Lilly I really like you!</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> I guess that's ok…</p>
<p><u>Smiley</u>: Not romantic enough for you?</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> Just not original enough</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Well I could try…</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> A lilly by any other name wouldn't smell as sweet, as you.</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> 0.0;;;;</p>
<p><u>Smliey:</u> I know, too out there.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Uhhhhhh, I just wish I could kiss her! I love Lilly so much and it kills me inside!</p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> I love you too, Miley.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> 00 Lilly? When did you get here?</p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> Around the time you started to talk about how you liked me…</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Well I do…like/love you that is.</p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> Well I love you too.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> SO why didn't you say anything earlier, before I made a fool of myself in front of Jake?</p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> He told me to be quiet.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> <b>Glares at Jake</b></p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> Well…it worked didn't it?</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Yeah.</p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> Sure did.</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> WOW! That took a lot of effort.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> LOL. Thanks..</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> Your welcome. Well now that my work here is done. I'll be off. Bye Lilly. Bye Miley. See you at school tomorrow.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Bye Jake. Thanks</p>
<p><u>ZombieeSlayaa:</u> Anytime.</p>

<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> So how long have you liked me for?</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Since about halfway through the first year I met you.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> What about you?</p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> Oh. Since about last year.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u></p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> I know! Meet me at the beach near Rico's in 15 minutes.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Ok. Cya there. We should talk in person, I guess.</p>
<p><u>Skatergirl:</u> Yeah.</p>
<p><u>Smiley:</u> Ok, see you then.</p>

It means so much to me…and I'll be happy to finish this for all you loyal people, and even those who weren't:D</p>
