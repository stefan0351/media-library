<P>a/n: I don't know how much I liked the last chapter …or how much I'm going to like this one.</P><P>Chapter Seven: ROCKSTAR</P><P>I awoke on Miley's lap to hear her singing softly, to the cows again, that had also slowly ventured closer to us and one was laying by Miley on the other side of her…it looked like it was Alfred from yesterday. "Oh god," I sat up quickly; looking over at Alfred he was massive. "He's huge, god I thought horses were big!"</P><P>Miley just smiled and reached over to pet him on the head, "He's my little guy, I raised him actually…he was one of the ones I showed…until Daddy told me if I showed him anywhere major he'd have to be sold in an auction. So I refused, and now he just hangs out here and visits with me when I come around."</P><P>"He's so huge though." I stated dumbly again.</P><P>"He was about four hundred pounds when I got him as a calf, now he's about fourteen hundred pounds. So yeah, he's pretty big…but we've got bigger out here." She just laughed at me and the shocked look on my face. Standing up, and brushing the dirt off her butt. "So, what do you want to do now?"</P><P>"Well, I was wondering what you were singing this time actually…"</P><P>"You heard me huh?" She frowned.</P><P>"Whatever you were singing sounded nice, I didn't mean it was bad."</P><P>"I was just singing 'Rockstar', another song I wrote about two years ago." She laughed, "I was a dumb kid."</P><P>"You must have been pretty smart to learn everything you know now and to write some great songs." I stood up beside her.</P><P>"Hmm…maybe." She walked back over to her four wheeler after she picked up our trash from the ground. Leaving the apples by Alfred she said, "He likes apples a lot."</P><P>I smiled, "Aw, maybe he isn't so bad for a big guy…he looks pretty cute actually, just laying there."</P><P>"He's a sweetie." She jumped on the four wheeler, "C'mon…oh and Lilly, I was wondering, since I have to go back 'nd work at the bed and breakfast for dinner tonight, tomorrow…uhm, do you wanna…"</P><P>"Want to what?" I questioned.</P><P>"Wanna go…to the movies or something?" She asked me softly.</P><P>"I'd love to." I mumbled into her back, when I got on the four wheeler behind her and wrapped my arms around her again, loving every second of it.</P><P>"Good," She revved the engine on the four wheeler, and did a wide turn heading back for the bed and breakfast for dinner.</P><P>I spent the next day just bumming around the bed and breakfast, most of it spent locked in my room since Miley had to help her mom with breakfast and lunch because she skipped out on helping so much yesterday and then was going to miss dinner tonight to go to a movie with me. Miley met up with me later though, knocking on my door of the room I was staying in, I hollered, "Come in!"</P><P>"Hey," She peeked her head in the room nervously. "So uh, we finished up with lunch."</P><P>"Oh cool, so…what movie did you want to see?"</P><P>She walked more into my room, taking a seat on the bed my mom had slept in the one night, "I don't know…I forgot to tell you, we have really lame movie theaters out here."</P><P>I grinned at her, "Don't worry about it, we can still see a movie I haven't been to one in ages."</P><P>"Really?" She asked looking doubtful.</P><P>"Yeah…in California I'm too busy with school or just…family stuff."</P><P>"Family stuff…mama said your mom just left you here for a month." She frowned at me.</P><P>"Yeah…she might've." Well, great was I the new gossip of the town? I didn't even live here, jeez.</P><P>"Do you want to talk 'bout it?"</P><P>"No."</P><P>"Oh…alright." She awkwardly kicked at the carpet, "So uh, want to see that uh…well actually I don't even know what's in theaters."</P><P>I laughed, "You don't even watch t.v. out here?"</P><P>"I watch t.v…sometimes, there's just so much else to do around here." She frowned. "Do you watch t.v. a lot at home?"</P><P>I thought for moment, "Actually…not really."</P><P>"Do you really want to see a movie?" She asked curiously.</P><P>"Uhh, I do if you do."</P><P>"What if I'd rather you came over to my house for the night and met Cat?"</P><P>"Then I'd definitely rather do that."</P><P>She smiled and grabbed my hand pulling me out of the room, "Great, you can sleep in my bed with me." She stated like I was the new puppy she just bought.</P><P>I just laughed, "We'll see Miley."</P>
